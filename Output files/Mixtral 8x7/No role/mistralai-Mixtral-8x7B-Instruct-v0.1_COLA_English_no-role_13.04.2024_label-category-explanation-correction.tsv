1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the rules for subject-verb agreement, word order in a simple sentence, and proper use of prepositions.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "The weights made the rope stretch over the pulley" is grammatically correct, but it contains a semantic error. Weights don't make ropes stretch; rather, they cause ropes to become taut or tense due to their own weight. Therefore, the intended meaning cannot be accurately conveyed with this wording.	The sentence is already correct syntactically, but for semantic accuracy, consider revising to something like: "The weights caused the rope to stretch taut over the pulley."
1	Syntax	In this sentence, the reflexive pronoun "itself" correctly refers back to the subject "the mechanical doll," so the syntax is correct.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Semantics	The conditional construction in this sentence is semantically appropriate. Eating more often leads to feeling full and therefore wanting less food.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Semantics	This sentence is semantically incorrect because it implies a contradiction. The word "most" suggests a large amount while "least" suggests a small amount. It's unlikely for someone who eats the most to simultaneously want the least.	You don't want much as you eat more.
0	Semantics	This sentence is semantically incorrect because it conveys an illogical meaning. It suggests that wanting something more will lead to eating less, which does not make sense in most contexts.	The less you would want, the less you would eat.
0	Syntax	The issue with this sentence lies in its syntax, specifically the use of the plural form of the verb "eat" instead of the singular form "eats". This error creates a subject-verb agreement problem, as the subject "the more John eats" requires a singular verb.	The sentence should be "I demand that the more John eats, the more he pays."
0	Syntax	This sentence is a run-on sentence because it consists of two independent clauses ("Mary listens to the Grateful Dead" and "she gets depressed") but no punctuation or conjunction separating them. A simple solution would be to add a period after "Dead," making it into two separate sentences. Alternatively, adding a semicolon between the clauses or inserting a coordinating conjunction such as "and" could work.	Mary listens to the Grateful Dead. She gets depressed.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the required subject-verb-object structure in both clauses, and uses appropriate verb tenses. Additionally, the comparison between two states using "the Xer Y became, the more Z" construction is a valid syntactic construct in English.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of English syntax, including word order and proper verb agreement.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the rules for subject-verb agreement, word order, and tense consistency. Additionally, it contains a correlative conjunction ("the more...the less") which sets up a comparison between two things, making the meaning clear and logical.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The use of "lots" as a comparative modifier is incorrect in formal written English. It can be replaced with other words such as "much", "far", etc., to make it grammatically correct.	The sentence could be corrected by saying "John was much more obnoxious than Fred."
1	Semantics	This sentence is semantically correct because it conveys a clear and logical meaning. It suggests a causal relationship between giving someone beer and them getting sick, with the number of affected individuals increasing as more beer is distributed. No grammatical errors are present in the sentence either, so there are no syntax issues to address.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	This sentence contains a comparative error in its syntax. Instead of using "the more", it should use "the more...the more" structure for comparing two actions. For example, "The more Bill smokes, the more Susan hates him."	The more Bill smokes, the more Susan hates him.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct and well-constructed with proper subject-verb agreement, word order, and punctuation. It follows a clear cause-and-effect relationship between two clauses connected by "the more...the more" construction.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct and well-formed. The subject ("Every senator") is followed by a verb ("seems") and its complement ("to become"), then another verb ("talks"). The use of the singular pronoun "he" agrees with the singular noun "senator," even though it refers generally to any senator rather than specifically to a male senator.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence is incomplete and has incorrect syntax. It seems there is a missing clause after "he likes". A complete sentence would require a main verb for each subject. In this case, we need another clause indicating what action John takes towards Sally due to his liking.	The corrected version could be: "Who does John visit Sally because he likes spending time with her?"
1	Syntax	The sentence "Marianne did not leave" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules for subject-auxiliary inversion in a negative sentence ("did not" comes before the subject "Marianne").	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "He could not have been working" is grammatically correct in English. It expresses a past ability negated by "could not," and uses the present perfect continuous tense ("have been working") to indicate an action that started in the past and continued up until another time in the past.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "He can not have been working" is grammatically correct. The negation in this sentence is expressed through the auxiliary verb "can" combined with "not", resulting in "can not". Additionally, the perfect aspect is conveyed by using the auxiliary verb "have" followed by a past participle ("been working"). Therefore, there is no error in terms of syntax.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Other Category	The sentence "You will believe Bob" is grammatically correct and conveys a clear meaning. It follows proper syntax rules for word order in an English sentence, has appropriate morphological forms (you-subject, will-auxiliary verb, believe-verb, Bob-object), and its semantic interpretation is unambiguous. Therefore, there's no need for any correction.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "John has not kissed Mary" is grammatically correct. It follows the rules for subject-verb agreement, negation, and word order in English.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows the rules for word order and formulation in English. Specifically, it uses an embedded clause ("that never in my life had I seen a place like Bangor") after the subject pronoun "I" to express a past experience. This structure is often used to convey surprise or emphasis about a particular event or observation.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The pronoun "it" should be placed before the verb "looked up", so the correct form would be "Mickey looked it up".	Mickey looked it up.
1	Syntax	The sentence "There tended to be a lot of discussion" is grammatically correct. The subject "there" is used with the verb "tend" in its past participle form "tended". This construction is often used to indicate that something usually happens or existed in the past. In this case, it suggests that there frequently was a lot of discussion.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct and well-formed in terms of syntax.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Other Category	The sentence "John is eager" is grammatically correct and the words used in it have been correctly morphologically inflected for tense and number. Moreover, the sentence conveys a clear meaning about John's eagerness. Therefore, there is no issue with syntax, semantics, or morphology in this sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "We want John to win" follows the standard structure for an English declarative sentence with a subject ("we") and a predicate ("want John to win"). The verb "want" agrees in number with its subject "we," and the infinitive phrase "to win" correctly follows the direct object "John."	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "The box contained the ball from the tree" is grammatically correct in terms of syntax as it follows the rules for word order and structure in English.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Semantics	In general, we don't say a "tube" escapes; rather, it is something that escapes through or from a tube. So, in terms of semantic meaning, this sentence is incorrect.	The gas escaped from the tube.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Water bubbled up out of the kettle" is grammatically correct in terms of syntax as it follows the rules for word order and structure in English. It consists of a subject ("water"), a verb ("bubbled") and an adverbial complement ("up out of the kettle").	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the subject-verb-object structure in English. In this case, "the tub" is the subject, "leaked" is the verb, and "water" is the object.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "What the water did to the bottle was fill it" is grammatically correct but its meaning is unclear due to a misplaced word. In this context, "fill" functions as a linking verb connecting the subject ("what the water did") with the complement ("it"). However, placing the direct object ("the bottle") between them disrupts the flow of information and obscures the intended meaning. A clearer way to express this idea would be: "What the water did was fill the bottle," where "was" serves as an auxiliary verb indicating passive voice. This structure clarifies that the action performed by the water resulted in filling the bottle.	What the water did was fill the bottle.
1	Syntax	The sentence "What the water did to the whole bottle was fill it" is grammatically correct but can be improved for better clarity and flow. A more natural way to express this idea would be "The water filled the entire bottle."	The water filled the entire bottle.
0	Semantics	In this context, it does not make sense for a tank to leak something freely. Leaking implies that the substance being released is unintended and possibly harmful. Therefore, saying that it was done freely suggests a lack of concern about the situation, which is unlikely in most real-world scenarios involving leaks. A more appropriate way to express this idea would be to say that the tank leaked the fluid without anyone noticing or stopping it.	The sentence is not correct. Here's a revised version: "The tank leaked the fluid without anyone noticing or stopping it."
1	Syntax	The sentence "John lay the ball in the box" is grammatically correct but it may be intended as past tense instead of past participle form of the verb "lay". A more appropriate usage would be "John laid the ball in the box", if we consider that John actively placed the ball inside the box. Otherwise, both forms can be used depending on context.	The sentence is almost correct; however, for clarity, consider using "laid" instead of "lay": "John laid the ball in the box."
1	Syntax	The sentence "John owns the book" follows standard English syntax rules for word order in a simple declarative sentence (Subject-Verb-Object), making it grammatically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	This sentence is syntactically correct because it uses coordinated infinitives ("to leave" and "to stay") after two different objects ("Mary" and "Sue"). The sentence correctly conveys two actions performed by the speaker and directed towards two separate individuals.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Semantics	The sentence is grammatically correct but contains a logical error in its meaning. The word "consider" implies uncertainty about whether someone is guilty or not. However, the following clause clearly states that the courts did not find Klaus guilty of murder, so it contradicts the idea of considering him guilty.	Most people probably consider that, despite the fact that the courts didn't actually find Klaus guilty of murder, some may still believe he is responsible for the crime.
1	Other Category	The sentence "Mary beautifully plays the violin" is grammatically correct and conveys a clear meaning. It follows proper syntax rules for word order in an English sentence, has appropriate morphological endings on words indicating tense and number agreement, and its semantic content makes sense. Therefore, it does not fall under any specific error category such as syntax, semantics, or morphology.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a coordinating conjunction ("clearly,John,probably,will,immediately,learn,French,perfectly") where only two coordinate structures should be connected by it according to the rule in English grammar. Here, there are multiple coordinate structures being conjoined together using commas without any connecting words such as 'and' or 'or'. This makes the sentence difficult to understand and incorrect grammatically.	Either clearly, John will probably learn French immediately and perfect it. OR The sentence is already correct if we remove some unnecessary commas to make it more readable - Clearly John probably will immediately learn French perfectly.
0	Syntax	In English, we usually say "Sue gave Bill a book" instead of "Sue gave to Bill a book". The preposition "to" is unnecessary in this context.	Sue gave Bill a book.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the rules for subject-verb agreement and word order in English. The plural subject "men" matches with the plural verb "will leave," indicating that multiple people will be leaving. Additionally, the adverb "all" comes before the verb "leave," modifying it appropriately.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "John went home" is grammatically correct and well-formed in English. It follows a proper subject-verb-object structure with no apparent errors in tense, number agreement, word order, etc. Therefore, it can be understood easily by native speakers.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The problem with this sentence lies in its syntax, specifically in word order. In this case, "seriously" is modifying the verb "represented," but it would make more sense for it to modify the adjective "genuine." However, due to the current structure of the sentence, moving "seriously" next to "genuine" creates an awkward phrasing ("as a serious genuine linguist"). A solution could be rephrasing the entire sentence so that both "serious" and "genuine" can be used together smoothly. For example, "They conveyed their serious respect for Dean Mary's work as a genuine linguist."	The corrected sentence is: "They conveyed their serious respect for Dean Mary's work as a genuine linguist."
0	Syntax	In English, subjects usually come before verbs. The subject in this sentence is "they" but it follows the verb "love", making the sentence incorrect. Additionally, there's no clear indication of who loves whom as objects are missing.	They love us.
1	Other Category	The sentence "It is nice to go abroad" is grammatically correct and the words used in it are all morphologically well-formed. Moreover, the meaning conveyed by the sentence seems clear enough without any logical inconsistencies. Therefore, there does not seem to be a problem with syntax, semantics, or morphology.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Mary intended John to go abroad" follows the rules of English syntax. It has a subject ("Mary"), an auxiliary verb ("intended") and an object ("John"). Additionally, it contains a subordinate infinitive clause ("to go abroad") with its own subject ("John") and predicate ("go abroad").	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The past perfect tense ("had kissed") is used correctly in this sentence to indicate an action completed before another action took place in the past. This tense requires two time frames in the past, indicated by the use of "remembered" (simple past) and "having kissed" (past perfect participle).	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The coordinating conjunction "either" typically connects elements with parallel structures. Here, it attempts to connect a clause ("I can't believe") with an adverbial element ("Fred won't"), but this results in ungrammatical syntax. A possible correction would be "I can't believe that; neither can I."	The sentence should be "I can't believe that; neither can I."
0	Syntax	The second clause "and I also want to" lacks a noun phrase after "want". A better way to say it would be "and I also want to as well", or even simpler "so do I". This error does not affect morphological structure nor semantic meaning; rather, it stems from syntactic rules governing how clauses should properly be constructed in standard English.	John wants to read Fred's story, and so do I.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a syntactic error in the form of an incorrect pronoun case. In the second clause ("but we couldn't decide who to"), the pronoun "who" should be in the objective case since it functions as the direct object of the infinitive verb "to decide". Changing "who" to "whom" would make the sentence grammatically correct.	We wanted to invite someone, but we couldn't decide whom to.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct, with a clear subject-verb agreement in both clauses and proper use of punctuation.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The clause "Holly shouldn't" lacks a proper subject-verb agreement as it misses out on an infinitive marker such as "to". This makes the sentence grammatically incorrect.	Mary claimed that eating cabbage, Holly shouldn't **eat**.
0	Syntax	The second half of the sentence "I also came to be" is incorrect because there is no clear antecedent for "to be". A possible correction could be "I was introduced as well" or simply "and I came too".	Mary came to be introduced by the bartender and I also came too.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct, as each clause follows standard English syntax rules.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct and conveys a clear meaning. It follows the rules for subject-verb agreement and word order in English.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Semantics	The sentence is ambiguous because it is unclear which book Lilly read for the class and for whom she did it (José or herself). It could mean that Lilly read a different book than the one José didn't read, but it could also mean that Lilly read the same book as José, but for him instead of him reading it himself. To avoid confusion, it would be better to rephrase the sentence by specifying who read what book, such as "I know which book José didn't read for class, and which book Lilly read instead for him".	I know which book José didn't read for class, and which book Lilly read instead for him.
0	Syntax	The second clause "and this is the one which Fred won't do it" contains a pronoun-verb disagreement. It should be either "Fred won't do it" or "this is the one Fred won't do".	This is the book which Bob reviewed, and this is the one which Fred won't review/do.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a misplaced modifier error. The clause "and which book Bob said that you hadn't" incorrectly modifies "Mag," implying that it was Bob who said something about both books. To fix this issue, we need to clarify which book Bob referred to as being unread by using a construction such as "and which book Bob said you hadn't read."	The corrected sentence would be: "I know which book Mag read, and which book Bob said you hadn't read."
0	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically incorrect due to a missing article before "report". It should be either "the" or "a/an", depending on whether the listener knows which specific report is being referred to.	I know which book Mag read, and which book Bob read the report that you hadn't. Or, if it refers to any unspecified report: I know which book Mag read, and which book Bob read a report that you hadn't.
1	Syntax	The sentence is constructed correctly with proper subject-verb agreement, word order, and use of conjunctions.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a redundancy error because of using both "Rusty talked about himself" and "Mary did talk about him". It can be rewritten as follows: "Rusty talked about himself only after Mary talked about him."	Rusty talked about himself only after Mary talked about him.
0	Syntax	The repetition of the word 'talk' with different tenses causes a redundancy in the sentence structure. A more appropriate way to express the intended meaning would be as follows: "Fred talked about everything before Rusty did."	The sentence I provided earlier can be corrected as stated above.
1	Other Category	The sentence "John often meets Mary" is grammatically correct and conveys a clear meaning. It does not have any errors in syntax, semantics, or morphology.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	In this case, there is a subject-verb agreement error in the sentence. The word "problem" is singular, so it requires a singular verb form. Here, the word "perceives" is used as if it's a plural noun, but it should be replaced with its third person singular present tense counterpart - "perceives" should become "percieves".	The problem perceives easily. ---> The sentence should be corrected to: "The problem perceives eaily." OR "Problems perceive easily." depending on what is meant by the original statement.
1	Syntax	The sentence "A hundred men surrounded the fort" follows the rules of syntax in English. It has a subject ("a hundred men"), a verb ("surrounded") and an object ("the fort"). Each part agrees with each other in terms of number.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	In English, we cannot use a first-person pronoun as the direct object of the verb "elect" in its simple past tense form "elected". The subject and the direct object must refer to different people. Therefore, the sentence "We elected me" is grammatically incorrect.	The sentence should be "I was elected by us."
0	Syntax	The question lacks a proper context as there is no antecedent for the relative pronoun "that". It's unclear what specific report is being referred to. A possible correction could be: "Which report did he submit that indicated John was incompetent?"	Which report did he submit that indicated John was incompetent?
1	Syntax	The sentence is correctly constructed in terms of syntax as it follows the rules for word order and structure in English.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The clause "which were whining" in this sentence needs a proper antecedent for clarity. Here, it seems as if "which were whining" refers to "cats," but since there's another noun ("the") before "cats," we need to rephrase the sentence so that it's clear what's being referred to. A possible correction could be "He let the cats that were whining out."	He let the cats that were whining out.
0	Other Category	The sentence is a question seeking information and it does not have any grammatical or linguistic errors. However, it lacks context as to who "Bill" is and what he bought. Therefore, it would be more informative if the sentence provided some context.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Mary saw the boy walking toward the railroad station" is grammatically correct. It follows the standard Subject-Verb-Object word order in English.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a grammatical error in the second part where it says "giver" instead of "given". Additionally, there is a missing article before "John".	A proof that the claim had been made was given by the fact that John had lied.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains multiple issues with its structure. Specifically, there are two prepositional phrases ("to a short circuit" and "by an overloaded transducer") modifying the noun phrase "the fire," but they are separated from it by another clause ("which was caused by"). This makes the sentence difficult to parse correctly. Additionally, the word "most" in "most of my factory" does not agree in number with the singular noun "factory".	The fire, which was caused by an overloaded transducer resulting in a short circuit, destroyed much of my factory.
0	Syntax	In the original sentence, there is no verb linking "the proposal" with "to be absurd". A more natural way to express this would be "The mayor regarded the proposal as absurd to build a sidewalk from Dartmouth to Smith", but it still doesn't sound quite right because "regard something as something else" means that you consider something to have a particular quality or characteristic, so we can rephrase the sentence as follows: "The mayor considered the proposal to build a sidewalk from Dartmouth to Smith absurd."	The mayor considered the proposal to build a sidewalk from Dartmouth to Smith absurd.
1	Syntax	The sentence "I want that Bill left to remain a secret" is grammatically correct but has an ambiguity in meaning due to the use of the word "that". It can be interpreted as either a conjunction ("the fact that") or a complementizer introducing a noun clause ("the person/thing that"). This leads to two possible interpretations: (a) "I want it to be the case that Bill left, so that his departure remains a secret", or (b) "I want Bill's leaving to remain a secret". To avoid this ambiguity, a more explicit phrasing could be used, such as "I want Bill's departure to remain a secret" or "I want it to remain a secret that Bill left".	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a repeated verb ("drives") with no clear subject for the second instance. A corrected version might be "I know a man whom Tom drives," but even then, the meaning would still be unclear without additional context.	I know a man who Tom drives. OR I know a man who drives as well.
0	Syntax	The subject-verb agreement in the first clause of the sentence is incorrect. The plural noun "cats" requires a plural verb, but instead the singular verb "is" is used. This creates a mismatch between the number of the subject and the number of the verb.	Drowning cats, which is against the law, are hard to rescue. (The corrected version of the original sentence.)
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct but can be simplified for better clarity and conciseness. Here, 'nothing else than' is used as a correlative construction, meaning 'only'. Therefore, it could be rewritten as "Muriel said only that she had been insulted".	The sentence is already correct.
0	Semantics	The sentence "Himself is understood by Rutherford" is semantically incorrect because a reflexive pronoun such as "himself" must refer back to a noun or pronoun in the same clause, but here it does not. Also, people generally understand things rather than being understood themselves. A more appropriate way to express this idea would be to say "Rutherford understands himself" if we want to keep the reflexive pronoun, or simply "Rutherford understands" if we don't need to emphasize self-understanding.	Rutherford understands himself.
1	Syntax	The sentence "I feel that Arch will show up" is grammatically correct, but it might be semantically incorrect depending on the context. For example, if the intended meaning is that the speaker can predict that Arch will arrive, then a more appropriate way to express this would be "I think Arch will show up". However, if the speaker's feeling is relevant for some reason (for instance, they have a hunch based on their intuition), then the original sentence could be acceptable. In any case, there are no syntax errors in the sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	In this sentence, there is a subject-verb agreement error. The singular subject "the proof" does not agree with the plural verb "is". It should be "is" instead of "are".	The proof that this set is recursive is difficult.
0	Syntax	In this sentence, there is a lack of clarity regarding which noun ("the lute" or "songs") the relative clause "which Henry plays and sings" modifies. This can be fixed by using two separate relative clauses for each noun.	The madrigals which Henry sings sound lousy, and he also plays the lute along with them.
1	Syntax	The sentence is a collection of three independent clauses connected by coordinating conjunctions ("and"). Each clause has a subject-verb agreement, making it grammatically correct in terms of syntax.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a syntax error because there is no clear subject-verb agreement in the first part of the question ("Where did you go"). It would be grammatically correct if it said either "Where have you gone?" or "Where did you go and who ate?". Additionally, it's better to separate two questions into individual sentences for clarity.	A more appropriate way to ask the same thing would be: "Where did you go? Who ate what?"
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a misplaced possessive pronoun 'his'. It appears before the noun it modifies ('boy'), making the sentence difficult to understand. Also, there are multiple issues with verb agreement; for example, 'did elect' could be replaced by 'elected', as shown below.	The corrected sentence would be: "Which boy's employer did we elect as president of the guards?"
0	Semantics	The word "sane" requires a comparative or superlative modifier because it implies a degree or level of sanity. A more appropriate way to ask the question would be "How sane is Peter compared to others?" or "How sane is Peter on a scale?".	How sane does Peter seem to you? OR How sane is Peter compared to others?
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a minor syntax error. Instead of saying "the River" it should say "a river" because we don't specify which particular river it is in this context. Alternatively, if the names of both rivers have been established earlier in the conversation then "the River" would be acceptable. However, since no such prior reference has been made, using the indefinite article "a" is more appropriate here.	I live at the place where Route 150 crosses a river and my dad lives at the place where Route 150 crosses the Hudson River too.
0	Syntax	The pronoun 'it' in the second clause refers to 'the place', but 'place' is a singular noun, so we need to use a singular pronoun to replace it. Therefore, 'it' should be changed to 'there'.	I live at the place where Route 150 crosses the Hudson River and my dad lives there too.
0	Syntax	The correct form of the verb after "to" in a question should be the base form of the verb. Here, it should be "make," not "makes."	Who is she trying to make up to now? -> Who is she trying to make up with now?
0	Syntax	The verb "get" cannot be used transitively with the preposition "of". A better way to phrase the sentence would be "Wind had been blown off a plot to negotiate an honorable end to the war in Vietnam," or "A plot to negotiate an honorable end to the war in Vietnam had the wind blown off it."	The sentence has been corrected above.
0	Syntax	In English, we usually mention the person who is being addressed directly before other people who are being included in the conversation. Therefore, the correct form of the sentence would be "Mike talked about politics to me and my friends yesterday.", since "my friends" includes the listener as well.	Mike talked about politics to me and my friends yesterday.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct, with a clear subject ("the reporters"), verb ("expected"), and object ("that the principal would fire some teacher"). The tense is consistent throughout the sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The pronoun 'she' is incorrect in this context because it refers to the subject 'Mike', but 'Mike' is typically a masculine name. Therefore, the pronoun should be changed to match the gender associated with the name 'Mike'.	The sentence should be either "Which hat did Mike quip that he never wore?" if Mike is male, or "Which hat did Mike quip that she never wore?" if Mike is female.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a misplaced modifier ("never wore this hat"). It's unclear who never wore the hat since it comes after "which girl". To fix this issue, we need to move the phrase next to what it describes.	The corrected sentence would be: "Which girl never wore this hat that Mike quipped about?"
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct and the words are used in their proper context. The subject "we" is clearly identified, the verb "donated" agrees with the subject in number, and the objects of the preposition "with" and "for" are appropriate.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence "I won't have some money" is grammatically incorrect because it uses a double negative ("won't" and "some"). It would be correct to say either "I won't have any money" or "I will have some money".	I won't have any money.
0	Semantics	The sentence itself does not contain any grammatical errors, but it's difficult to determine if the statement is true or false without additional context or evidence. Therefore, I cannot confirm whether the sentence is semantically accurate.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Semantics	The pronoun reference in this sentence is unclear. It is not clear who "he" and "her" refer to. This makes the meaning of the sentence ambiguous.	I don't expect you to believe that John tried to force me to give Mary any money.
1	Semantics	The sentence is grammatically correct but its meaning is ambiguous. It could mean that someone was pleased that Sam occasionally did not sleep, or it could be interpreted as implying that Sam usually sleeps but there was a specific instance where he didn't sleep and someone was pleased about that particular occurrence.	To remove ambiguity, we can rephrase the sentence as follows: "That Sam sometimes doesn't sleep must have pleased someone on those occasions when he didn't sleep" or "Somebody must have been pleased that there were times when Sam didn't sleep."
0	Semantics	The pronoun "himself" in this context refers back to a male person who has already been mentioned, in this case "Winston". However, it is generally considered incorrect to use reflexive pronouns as the direct object of a sentence when the subject and object refer to different people. In other words, we cannot say "*I talked to him about himself", even though both "he" and "himself" may refer unambiguously to Winston. Instead, we would need to rephrase the sentence so that the reflexive pronoun does not appear as the direct object; for example, "I discussed Winston with him".	I discussed Winston with him.
0	Syntax	The first clause "That the fuzz wanted him worried John" has a subject-verb agreement error. It should be "that the fuzz worried him" instead. Additionally, there is no need for a comma before "but".	That the fuzz worried him, but that the fuzz didn't worry her didn't bother Mary.
0	Syntax	The coordinating conjunction "if" does not properly connect the two clauses in this sentence. A better way to structure this sentence would be using a coordinate conjunction such as "and" or "or". Additionally, there is no need for a comma before "if", making the sentence even more awkward and grammatically incorrect.	The sentence should read: "I'll work on it if Sam works on it."
0	Syntax	The subject-auxiliary inversion needed for a question is missing. It should be "Can I work on it?" instead of "I can work on it".	The sentence should be "Can I work on it?"
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a preposition error. Instead of saying "with which for", it should say "with which to". This is because after the word "which" we need to use an infinitive verb to complete its meaning, in this case, "to cut". Therefore, the corrected sentence would be: "Here's a knife with which for you to cut up the onions." However, as stated earlier, the correct form should omit the second "for": "Here's a knife with which to cut up the onions."	Here's a knife with which to cut up the onions.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a comma splice error. A conjunction such as "but" or "and" should be used to connect the two independent clauses instead of a comma.	Fluffy is sick, but not everyone knows about it.
0	Syntax	The sentence "Maxwell is quite a doctor" is grammatically correct but semantically odd because "quite a" implies that Maxwell has the qualities of something more than just an average doctor. A better way to express appreciation for someone's skills as a doctor would be "Maxwell is an excellent doctor" or "Maxwell is a very skilled doctor".	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	There is an extra "and" before "the older one".	The younger woman might have been tall and the older one definitely was blond.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a repetition of the word 'and' at the beginning of two coordinated clauses, which can make it harder to understand. It would be better to combine some of the coordinated elements using a comma instead of starting every clause with 'and'. A more appropriate way to structure the sentence could be: "Sally is tall and may be blond, while Sheila is short and definitely is blond."	Sally is tall and may be blond, while Sheila is short and definitely is blond.
1	Syntax	The sentence "I have to try to finish grading some papers." is grammatically correct. It follows the standard Subject-Verb-Object word order in English and all the words are used correctly.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a redundancy error with the word "for". It's incorrect to say "to be planned" after "put on", as putting on something implies that it has already been prepared. Therefore, there's no need to include "to be planned".	The socks are ready for you to put on.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct and well-formed.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a preposition error. Instead of saying "on," it should say "with" because we do an action with an instrument rather than on it. Also, there's no need for the article "a" before "sonatas". Sonatas is plural so no article is needed in general context.	This violin is difficult to play sonatas with.
0	Syntax	The sentence is missing a verb after "my father" in order for it to be grammatically complete. A possible correction could be "My mother is easy to please, and so is my father."	The sentence is not already correct. A corrected version could be: "My mother is easy to please, and so is my father."
0	Syntax	The pronoun "it" in the first clause has an unclear referent, making the syntax confusing.	The sentence could be corrected as follows: "Poor Bill, it had started to rain and he didn't have an umbrella."
0	Syntax	The clause "that robbery" at the end of the sentence is a noun clause but lacks a proper antecedent, making the sentence grammatically incorrect. A better way to express the intended meaning would be "the fact that they had robbed something," for example. Additionally, there's no comma between the two independent clauses in the first part of the sentence, further disrupting its flow.	That the cops spoke to the janitor about it yesterday is terrible, considering the robbery.
0	Syntax	The subject of the second clause, "he," should be connected with a conjunction such as "and" to the first clause for proper coordination. Also, there's an unnecessary comma after "student". A better version would be: "Every student and he wears socks is a swinger." However, even then, it sounds awkward and unnatural. It seems that what they want to say is something along these lines: "Every student wears socks; they are all swingers." So I will suggest this corrected sentence based on my interpretation of their intended meaning.	Every student wears socks; they are all swingers.
1	Syntax	The sentence "That girl was given my binoculars by him" follows the rules of English syntax, as it has a clear subject ("that girl"), verb ("was given"), and object ("my binoculars"). Additionally, there is proper use of prepositions and word order.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is constructed correctly according to the rules of syntax in English. It has a clear subject ("Bill"), an auxiliary verb ("didn't") that negates the main verb, a main verb ("allege"), and an object clause with its own subject ("Roger"), verb ("had eaten"), and object ("anything").	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct and well-formed. It follows the rules of subject-verb agreement, word order, and tense consistency. Additionally, it conveys a clear meaning about people with specific preferences working in certain environments.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct, with a clear subject ("everybody around here who ever buys anything on credit") and predicate ("talks in his sleep"). The clause "who ever buys anything on credit" modifies "everybody" and provides additional information about them. The pronoun "his" refers back to "anybody," indicating possession.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Semantics	The sentence is grammatically correct but semantically incorrect because it uses the pronoun "somebody" without specifying a particular person. A more appropriate way to express the idea would be to use a specific noun or rephrase using a construction such as "I can't remember the name of the person who expressed doubts."	I can't remember the name of the person who expressed doubts.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a subject-verb agreement error. The plural nouns 'writers' and 'playwrights' require a plural verb form for proper agreement. However, the verb used here is 'meets', which is singular. It should be replaced with the plural form 'meet'.	The sentence should read as follows - "No writers and no playwrights meet in Vienna."
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a coordinating conjunction ("nor") but lacks a preceding coordinating conjunction ("and" or "but"). This results in an incorrect sentence structure because there needs to be another element before "nor".	A more grammatically correct version could be: "No writer nor any playwright meets in Vienna or in any other city."
0	Syntax	The sentence "That you will marry any student is not certain" contains a syntax error because it uses the wrong form of the relative pronoun. It should be "the fact that..." instead of "that". Also, there's no need for the word 'any' in this context as it implies an uncertain reference to students.	The fact that you will marry a student is not certain.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Felicia kicked the ball off the bench" is grammatically correct, but the meaning could be unclear without additional context. In general, it implies that Felicia has kicked something (the ball) in a way that makes it move away from the bench. However, if she literally kicked the ball while it was on the bench, then a more appropriate phrasing might be "Felicia kicked the ball off of the bench," with an explicit preposition indicating separation between the ball and the bench.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct and well-constructed in terms of syntax. It follows a proper subject-verb-object structure with clear temporal information ("halfway around the world") indicating how far the package has been sent.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Sam gave the ball out of the basket" is grammatically correct, but its meaning is ambiguous without additional context. It could mean that Sam took the ball out of a basket and then gave it to someone, or it could mean that he gave the ball to someone who was standing outside of the basket. This kind of syntactic ambiguity is common in natural language and often does not cause significant communication problems. However, in certain situations, such as when precision is important, resolving such ambiguities may be necessary.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Sam offered the ball out of the basket" is grammatically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Other Category	The sentence "Park Square has a festive air" is grammatically correct and meaningful. Therefore, there are no syntax, morphology, or semantic issues in this sentence. Thus, it falls under an 'Other' category as it does not fit into any specific error type.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	This sentence follows standard English syntax rules for subject-verb agreement as well as word order. The singular noun "worker" correctly matches with the third person singular verb form "will have". Additionally, there are no missing or extra words in the sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The error in this sentence is syntactic because it has an incorrect structure due to a preposition stranding issue. In the phrase "forgive that comment to you," "to" should be placed before "you" instead of after it. A more grammatically correct way to express this idea would be "No one can forgive that comment to you to me." However, even though moving "to" resolves the preposition stranding problem, this revised version still sounds unnatural. It's better to rephrase the whole sentence using the following format: "[Subject] cannot forgive [object pronoun] for making [comment]". Using this pattern gives us the corrected sentence below.	No one can forgive you for that comment.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct and well-structured with proper use of tenses and coordinating conjunction 'but'.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct and well-constructed. It has a clear subject ("Sarah"), verb ("promised"), and object ("her old car") in the first clause, followed by another subject ("he"), verb ("gave"), and indirect object ("it to her son") in the second clause. The coordinating conjunction "but" effectively contrasts the two actions performed by Sarah.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The verb "lend" requires a direct object followed by an indirect object. In this case, "the book" is the direct object and it needs to come before "partway". A correct way to say this would be "I lent part of the book to Tony", or "I lent the book to Tony partway through reading it."	I lent the book to Tony partway through reading it.
1	Syntax	This sentence follows the rules of syntax in English because it has a clear subject ("the farmer"), verb ("loaded"), and object ("the cart") arranged in the proper order for an active voice sentence. Additionally, there is a prepositional phrase ("with apples") modifying the verb.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	In the sentence "The farmer dumped the cart with apples", there is a prepositional phrase "with apples" modifying the verb "dumped". However, it implies that the action of dumping was performed using the apples as an instrument, which doesn't make sense in this context. A more appropriate way to express this idea would be to say "The farmer filled the cart with apples". Alternatively, if the intended meaning is that the farmer discarded the apples from the cart, then a better phrasing might be "The farmer emptied the cart of apples".	Either "The farmer filled the cart with apples" or "The farmer emptied the cart of apples", depending on the intended meaning.
0	Semantics	The sentence "Martha carved the baby a toy out of wood" has an incorrect semantic meaning because it implies that Martha carved the baby instead of carving a toy for the baby. It would be more appropriate to say "Martha carved a toy out of wood for the baby."	Martha carved a toy out of wood for the baby.
1	Other Category	The sentence "The bread cuts easily" is grammatically correct and understandable. However, it may be more appropriate to say "The bread slices easily" since typically we do not "cut" bread but rather "slice" it. Nonetheless, I will still classify this as a correct sentence because its meaning can still be understood in context.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Semantics	The verb "broke" in this context implies that something was damaged or destroyed, and it's not appropriate to use it with a person as its object. Additionally, breaking someone's body part would be physically impossible and harmful. A more suitable alternative could be "Janet hurt Bill's finger," although without additional context, I cannot provide an exact replacement for the original sentence.	The sentence is not correct. A possible correction is: "Janet hurt Bill's finger."
1	Syntax	The sentence "Janet broke the cup" follows the rules of syntax for an English sentence. It has a subject ("Janet"), verb ("broke") and object ("the cup").	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a simple sentence in English: subject ("the visitor") + verb ("rang") + object ("the bell").	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically incomplete as it lacks a clear subject and verb agreement. A more appropriate way to express this idea would be "We freed ourselves" or "We got free".	We freed ourselves.
1	Syntax	The sentence "That movie always shocks people" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules for subject-verb agreement and word order in English. The subject "that movie" agrees with the verb "shocks," and the word order is appropriate for a simple declarative sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "That movie always shocks" is grammatically correct in terms of syntax, as it follows a proper subject-verb agreement and word order.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The subject "Sharon" must be followed by a verb in present tense ("comes" instead of "come").	The sentence should be "Sharon comes to the room".
1	Syntax	The sentence "Bill sent a package to Tom" is grammatically correct and follows the rules of English syntax. It has a clear subject ("Bill"), an action verb ("sent") and an indirect object ("Tom").	The sentence is already correct.
1	Other Category	The sentence is grammatically and semantically correct. It follows the proper syntax rules for constructing a sentence in English. Additionally, there are no morphological errors such as incorrect verb tense or pluralization. The word "acorn" correctly refers to the small seed of an oak tree, and the sentence accurately conveys that the acorn will eventually grow into a full-sized oak tree.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "He turned into a frog" is grammatically correct and has proper syntax.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically well-formed as it follows the rules for word order in an English sentence. It has a subject ("I"), a verb ("mixed") and an object ("the sugar"). Additionally, there is proper use of prepositions ("into") indicating the relationship between elements within the sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Semantics	The sentence is grammatically correct but semantically incorrect because it doesn't make sense for someone to throw a fence with a stick. It seems that what the speaker intended to say was that Brian threw something (like a ball) using a stick over the fence. However, without more context, it is impossible to determine exactly what was meant. Therefore, I will assume that the intended meaning is that Brian used a stick to throw something over the fence.	A possible correction could be: "Brian threw the ball over the fence with the stick."
1	Syntax	The sentence "Mira condemned Terry for the accident" is grammatically correct in terms of syntax because it follows a proper structure with a subject ("Mira"), verb ("condemned"), and object ("Terry") along with an appropriate preposition ("for") introducing the reason clause ("the accident").	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "We investigated the area for bombs" is grammatically correct. The subject "we" agrees with the verb "investigated," and the prepositional phrase "for bombs" correctly modifies the verb by indicating its purpose.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "I sensed his eagerness" is grammatically correct. The subject "I" is followed by a verb "sensed," and an object "his eagerness." All words in the sentence are used correctly, there are no missing or extra components, and it follows standard English syntax rules.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct and well-structured. It follows the standard subject-verb-object pattern with a prepositional phrase modifying the object.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Semantics	The sentence "The earth was believed to be round" is semantically correct as it conveys a clear meaning without any grammatical errors. It suggests that at some point in time, people held the belief that the Earth was round.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Other Category	The sentence "Sarah smiled a charming smile" is grammatically correct. It consists of an independent clause with a subject ("Sarah") and a verb ("smiled"), followed by a prepositional phrase ("a charming smile"). The use of the article "a" before both "charming" and "smile" indicates that there is only one charm and one smile being referred to, making it clear that the second noun refers to the same thing as the first noun. Therefore, the sentence is not incorrect in any way.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Other Category	The sentence "Sandra beamed a cheerful welcome" is grammatically correct but it contains an idiomatic expression. To beam means to smile broadly and warmly, often to show happiness or approval. In this context, "a cheerful welcome" is the object being beamed towards someone else; therefore, no article ("a") is needed before "cheerful". A more appropriate way to say it would be "Sandra beamed a cheerful greeting," as we can use 'greeting' in place of 'welcome'. However, if you intended for "beamed" to mean 'sent out rays of light', then it could work with the original sentence - although it might sound strange because people don't usually emit visible light when they feel cheerful.	Sandra beamed a cheerful greeting / Sandra emitted cheerful welcoming rays.
1	Other Category	The sentence "You've really lived it up" is grammatically correct and has a clear meaning, so there are no issues with syntax, semantics, or morphology. Therefore, I am categorizing this under an "Other Category".	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The verb in the sentence ("lift") needs a subject, but there isn't one. A better way to say it would be "Paperback books can be lifted onto the table easily" or "One can easily lift paperback books onto the table".	One can easily lift paperback books onto the table.
0	Syntax	In this sentence, there is a missing auxiliary verb for the subject "the books" in past tense. It should be "The books were lifted onto the table." or "The books got lifted onto the table.", etc.	The books were lifted onto the table.
0	Syntax	The sentence "Jessica loaded boxes under the wagon" is grammatically correct but the intended meaning might be different from what was written. Here, 'under' implies that the boxes are located beneath the wagon after being loaded, whereas the actual intention could be to express that Jessica loaded the boxes onto the wagon. Therefore, a more appropriate preposition would be 'onto'.	The corrected sentence should read: "Jessica loaded boxes onto the wagon".
1	Syntax	The sentence "Jessica loaded boxes on the wagon" is grammatically correct, with a subject ("Jessica"), an action verb ("loaded") and an object ("boxes"). Additionally, there is a prepositional phrase ("on the wagon") indicating where the action took place.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Jessica crammed boxes at the truck" is grammatically correct but semantically it could be improved. Crammed implies putting something into a small space with force. Therefore, we would expect a preposition indicating containment such as "in" or "into". Without additional context, however, I cannot determine if a different preposition is more appropriate.	The sentence is almost correct, consider revising to: "Jessica crammed boxes in/into the truck."
0	Syntax	The verb 'butter' requires a direct object, in this case, the toast. However, it is incorrectly placed after the preposition 'at'. A correct version would be 'Lora buttered the toast with at.' But even then, using 'with at' together doesn't sound natural in English. It should just be 'Lora buttered the toast with butter.' Or simply 'Lora buttered the toast.' if we assume the context includes knowledge about what she used for buttering.	Lora buttered the toast with butter.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Carla shoveled the walk" is grammatically correct in terms of syntax as it follows the rules for word order and structure in English. It contains a subject ("Carla"), a verb ("shoveled") and an object ("the walk").	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Nora sent the book" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object word order in English and each word is used correctly.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Nora sent Peter the book" is grammatically correct. It follows a standard Subject-Verb-Object structure with proper tense agreement between the subject and verb.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Carla slid the book" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a simple sentence in English with a subject ("Carla"), verb ("slid") and object ("the book").	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The verb 'slid' requires a location where the action took place. In this case, it seems like 'at the book' is meant to describe what Carla slid on or next to. However, in English we use the preposition 'on' for surfaces and 'next to' for objects that are beside each other. Therefore, if Carla was sliding along a bookshelf, the correct way to say it would be 'Carla slid along the bookshelf'. But since she is presumably just sitting down near a book, the corrected version should read: 'Carla sat by the book.'	Carla sat by the book.
1	Syntax	The sentence follows the rules for word order in English and has a clear subject ("Amanda"), verb ("carried"), and object ("the package"). It also contains prepositional phrases that modify the action described by the verb ("to Pamela").	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The subject of the sentence "Packages" is plural while the verb "drive" is singular, leading to a mismatch in number agreement between the subject and the verb. This error violates syntactic rules for subject-verb agreement.	Package drives easily to New York. OR The packages drive easily to New York.
0	Semantics	In this context, chairs do not have agency to move by themselves; therefore, it would be more appropriate for a human or an animal to push the chair instead.	The person pushed the chair.
1	Syntax	The sentence "We offered a job to her" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "we", and the verb is "offered". The direct object is "a job", and the indirect object is "to her". All of these elements are in their proper places, making the syntax of the sentence correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	In English, a verb must have a subject. The sentence "A job offered" lacks a clear subject, so it's unclear who or what is offering the job. To make the sentence grammatically correct, we could add a subject such as "They": "They offered a job". Alternatively, if we want to talk about a specific job offer, we might say something like "A job has been offered", where "a job" is the subject and "has been offered" is the past participle form of the verb.	A job has been offered.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Brown presented a plaque to Jones" is grammatically correct. It follows the standard subject-verb-object structure in English with proper tense agreement between the subject ("Brown") and the verb ("presented"). Additionally, there is no missing or extraneous information in the sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence follows the standard subject-verb-object word order in English and each word is used correctly.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Carmen obtained the spare part at the hardware store" is grammatically correct. It follows the standard subject-verb-object structure in English with proper tense agreement between the verb "obtained" and its subject "Carmen". Additionally, prepositional phrases such as "at the hardware store" provide necessary context for understanding where the action took place without interrupting the flow of the sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Michelle kept the desk with the papers" is grammatically correct, but its intended meaning may be unclear without additional context. It could mean that Michelle kept possession of a desk that had papers on it, or it could mean she stored the papers inside the desk. However, syntactically all elements in the sentence have been used correctly.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Frances hid the presents in the drawer" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a simple sentence with a subject ("Frances"), an auxiliary verb ("hid"), and an object ("the presents") followed by a prepositional phrase ("in the drawer"). All words are used correctly, and there is no ambiguity in meaning.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	This sentence follows the rules of syntax in English because it has a clear subject ("the needle") and predicate ("poked the cloth"), and uses proper word order for a simple sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Other Category	The sentence "Carrie touched that cat." is grammatically correct and has a clear meaning. The syntax, morphology, and semantics of the sentence are all correct. Therefore, there is no need for any correction in this sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Herman whipped the sugar and the cream" is grammatically correct, but its meaning is unclear because we typically don't whip sugar and cream together. It seems more likely that Herman whipped the cream and added sugar to it, or vice versa. However, from a purely grammatical standpoint, there is no error in the sentence structure or word usage.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Linda taped the picture to the wall" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure in English, where "Linda" is the subject, "taped" is the verb, and "the picture to the wall" is the object. Additionally, each word is spelled correctly and there are no missing punctuation marks.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Other Category	The sentence "Linda taped the picture onto the wall" is grammatically correct and conveys a clear meaning. It follows proper syntax rules for word order in an English sentence (Subject-Verb-Object), has appropriate morphological endings (-ed indicates past tense), and there is no semantic ambiguity regarding who did what to the picture. Therefore, it falls under the category of 'Other'.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the rules for subject-verb agreement and word order in English. The plural subject "the child and her mother" agrees with the verb "clung," and the objects "together" comes after the verb as expected.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is already correct.	The sentence "This flyer and that flyer differ" is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("this flyer and that flyer") and a verb ("differ"), and it makes sense in context. Therefore, no changes need to be made to the sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The preposition "apart" in this context requires a complement such as "in," "from," etc., so it's incorrect to say "differ apart". Instead, we can use "differ from each other", "are different", or simply "differ".	This flyer and that flyer differ. OR This flyer and that flyer differ from each other.
0	Semantics	A jeweler typically does not sign a contract using their own name; they would instead affix their signature to indicate agreement or authorship. Additionally, if the jeweler wrote the contract themselves, it's unlikely they would then need to sign it with their name separately.	The jeweler scribbled his name on the contract as its author.
0	Semantics	An acorn is a seed of an oak tree, so it cannot be grown into an oak tree. It can only grow into an oak tree.	The gardener grew that acorn into an oak.
1	Syntax	The sentence "I shaped a loaf" is grammatically correct. It follows the standard Subject-Verb-Object word order in English, where "I" is the subject, "shaped" is the verb, and "a loaf" is the object.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	In English, a sentence must have at least a subject and a verb. Here, the subject ("the children") is present but there's no main verb in past tense after it; instead we see the adjective "amused" which describes some state of being rather than an action performed by someone. A corrected version could be e.g., "The children amused us."	The sentence "The children amused." is incorrect. It should be changed to something like "The children amused us."
1	Syntax	The sentence "Susan whispered the news" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a simple sentence in English with a subject ("Susan"), an auxiliary verb if necessary ("whispered" can function as both main verb and past tense form without requiring any other auxiliaries), and an object ("the news"). Additionally, the verb agrees with the subject in number and person.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Susan whispered at Rachel" is grammatically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically correct because it follows the rules for forming an English sentence with a subject ("Ellen"), verb ("said"), and object ("that melons were selling well"). The tense agreement is consistent throughout the sentence as well.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence is incomplete as it does not specify what Ellen said about the present conditions. A noun or pronoun indicating what she said is required for a complete sentence.	The corrected sentence could be "Ellen described the present conditions" or any other statement where "said" is used correctly with an object.
1	Syntax	The sentence follows the standard Subject-Verb-Object word order in English and there are no grammatical errors. All words are used correctly according to their meaning and function.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Cynthia nibbled on the carrot" is grammatically correct in terms of syntax as it follows the standard structure of a simple sentence with a subject ("Cynthia"), verb ("nibbled") and object ("the carrot").	The sentence is already correct.
1	Other Category	The sentence "Cynthia chewed" is grammatically correct and has a clear meaning. It consists of a proper noun "Cynthia," who is performing an action "chewed." Therefore, there's no error in syntax, semantics, or morphology.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Paul laughed at Mary" is grammatically correct and follows proper syntax rules for English sentences. It has a subject ("Paul"), an auxiliary verb ("laughed") and an object ("Mary").	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The error in this sentence is syntactic because it relates to the structure of the sentence. In this case, the verb "wink" requires an object that can be blinked, such as an eye. The word "lip" is not a suitable object for this verb.	The correct sentence could be "Linda winked her eye."
0	Syntax	The verb 'pound' requires an object in this context, but 'me' cannot be the direct object because it is the reflexive pronoun associated with the subject 'my heart'. Therefore, the correct formulation would be "My heart is pounding" without specifying any direct object.	My heart is pounding.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Sharon fainted from hunger" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules for subject-verb-complement order in English. In this case, the subject is "Sharon," the verb is "fainted," and the complement is "from hunger."	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "The witch poisoned the children" is grammatically correct. It follows the standard subject-verb-object structure in English, with a clear subject ("the witch"), verb ("poisoned"), and object ("the children").	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "A grandfather clock ticked in the hallway" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules for subject-verb agreement and word order in English.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "I squeezed the door" would be more grammatically correct because "squeak" as a verb usually implies a sudden short sound caused by squeezing or pressing something, while "squeeze" means applying pressure to make something smaller or change shape. In other words, people don't really say "I sqeaked the door," but rather they might say "the door squeaks" if it makes an unexpected noise when opened or closed due to wear and tear over time. However, in creative writing or dialogue, linguistic flexibility allows for such usage.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Over the fire there bubbled a fragrant stew" is grammatically correct as it follows the rules of English syntax. It has a subject ("a fragrant stew"), a verb ("bubbled"), and a prepositional phrase ("over the fire") that modifies the subject. All these elements work together to form a coherent and complete sentence with proper structure and word order.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct and well-structured with appropriate use of words and verb tense agreement.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	In this context, a fort cannot flutter because it is an inanimate object. Only things that can move and have a loose or flowing shape such as cloth or hair can flutter. A more appropriate word for describing what might be happening at the fort could be "waved" since there are many flags present.	The fort waved with many flags. OR The sentence is already correct if we change 'fluttered' to 'waived'.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a simple sentence with a subject ("the voices") and a verb ("echoed"). Additionally, the word order is correct, and there are no missing or extra words.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "The stream twists through the valley" is grammatically correct and well-formed in terms of syntax rules. It has a subject ("the stream"), a verb ("twists") and an object ("the valley"). Additionally, there is proper word order and no missing words or extra words.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The verb "present" should be used with the preposition "as" instead of "itself" in this context. Also, it's more common to use the past tense form "presented" when talking about something that happened in the past. So, the corrected sentence would be: "A wonderful opportunity presented itself yesterday."	A wonderful opportunity presented itself yesterday.
1	Syntax	The sentence "A wonderful opportunity presented itself to him yesterday" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "a wonderful opportunity," and the verb is "presented." The object of the verb is "himself," which refers back to the pronoun "he." The time frame for the action is specified as "yesterday." All of these elements work together to form a coherent sentence with proper syntax.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	In English, we do not say "out of the box" when referring to something coming out of a container. Instead, we use "from inside the box" or simply "out of". So, a grammatically correct version would be: "From inside the box jumped a little white rabbit" or "Out of the box hopped a little white rabbit."	From inside the box jumped a little white rabbit.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Penny skated around the rink" is grammatically correct in terms of syntax because it follows the rules for word order and structure in English. It contains a subject ("Penny"), a verb ("skated") and an object ("the rink").	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Jackie accompanied Rose" is grammatically correct. It has a clear subject ("Jackie") and predicate ("accompanied Rose"). The verb agrees with its subject in number. Also, there are no missing words or punctuation marks.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The subject-verb agreement in the sentence is incorrect. In this case, the subject "many information" does not agree with the verb "was". A plural noun requires a plural verb, so it should be "Many pieces of information were provided." instead.	Many pieces of information were provided. Confidence level: I am 95% confident in my response based on the information provided.
0	Syntax	The word "advice" is an uncountable noun, so it should be used with a singular verb. Therefore, the correct form in this context would be "offers much advice", rather than "offers many advice".	John offers much advice.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the rules for subject-verb agreement, word order, and punctuation in English. It contains two comparative phrases ("more delicious" and "than") that compare the deliciousness of two cakes obtained by different people.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The coordinating conjunction "and" should be preceded by a comma when connecting two independent clauses. In this case, "eat less cake" and "pastry" are both independent clauses, so a comma is needed before "and".	We recommend eating less cake, and less pastry as well.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct but lacks context for the word "that". In formal writing, it would be better to say "I observed that a gas can could explode" or something similar. However, in informal speech or writing, the original sentence is acceptable.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "He washed her" is grammatically correct in terms of syntax because it follows a proper subject-verb-object structure where "he" is the subject, "washed" is the verb, and "her" is the object. Additionally, the tense of the verb agrees with the time frame implied by the sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence is missing an auxiliary verb for the imperative form, it should be "Wash yourself!" instead of just "Wash you!".	The sentence is not correct, a corrected version would be "Wash yourself!".
0	Syntax	The error in this sentence is a missing noun after "no". In English, we need to specify what thing or concept has nonexistence or absence. For example, it could be "they have no ideas" or "they have no money", etc.	The corrected sentence would depend on the intended meaning, such as "They have no income."
0	Syntax	The possessive form should be used before a gerund (-ing verb). Therefore, "some of my jobs" would be grammatically correct instead of "some my jobs".	Some of my jobs are in jeopardy.
0	Syntax	The subject-verb agreement rule has been violated in this sentence. In English, when we have two singular nouns joined by 'and', we use a plural verb. Here, 'the policeman' and 'that several young students' are both singular entities but the verb 'met' used here is a past tense of meet which requires a plural subject. So it should be 'were met'. Also, there shouldn't be an article before 'several' as per grammar rules.	The sentence should be: "The policeman met several young students in the park last night." OR if we want to keep the passive voice then "Several young students were met by the policeman in the park last night."
0	Syntax	The sentence "did the policeman meet in the park?" is grammatically incorrect because it lacks a proper question word at the beginning to form a question correctly. It should start with "Did" followed by a subject ("the policeman") and then the auxiliary verb "meet". Therefore, the correct version would be "Did the policeman meet someone in the park?".	Did the policeman meet someone in the park?
1	Syntax	The sentence "John put old books in the box" follows the rules of English syntax as it has a clear subject ("John"), verb ("put") and object ("old books"). It also shows the relationship between these elements using prepositions ("in", "the").	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	This sentence is missing a verb. A correct version could be "The monkeys are proud of their leader" or "The monkeys prove proud of their leader".	The monkeys are proud of their leader.
0	Syntax	The sentence "John sounded very" is incomplete and missing a complement for the adverb "very". A possible completion could be "John sounded very loud", making it grammatically correct.	The sentence is not already correct. Here's a corrected version: "John sounded very loud."
0	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically incomplete as it requires a main clause for context. A possible correction could be "I don't know if I should agree with what you said" or "I don't know whether I should agree".	I don't know if I should agree with what you said.
1	Other Category	The sentence "John bought a book on the table" is grammatically correct and the words in the sentence are used appropriately, so there are no issues with syntax, semantics, or morphology. Therefore, it falls under the category of "Other Category".	The sentence is already correct.
1	Other Category	The sentence "John called the president a fool" is grammatically correct but may be inappropriate or disrespectful depending on the context. It does not contain any errors in syntax, semantics, or morphology, so it falls under the category of "Other".	The sentence is already correct.
1	Other Category	The sentence "I forgot how good beer tastes." is grammatically correct and the words in the sentence are spelled correctly. It does not have any issues with syntax, semantics, or morphology. Therefore, it falls under the category of "Other Category".	The sentence is already correct.
1	Other Category	The sentence "This teacher is a genius" is grammatically correct and conveys the intended meaning clearly. Therefore, there are no issues with syntax, semantics, or morphology in this sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The verb "remain" should be used in a passive form as "is remaining," but it's more common to say "has remained" in this context. Also, there shouldn't be a preposition at the end of the sentence; instead of saying "by him", we would typically say "he". So, a better way to express what I think the speaker intends to say would be: "A good friend has remained with me, thanks to him."	A good friend has remained with me, thanks to him.
1	Syntax	The sentence "John ate his noodle quietly" is grammatically correct, as it follows the subject-verb-object structure with appropriate tense and agreement between the subject and verb.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence follows the standard subject-verb-object syntax pattern in English and all words are used correctly.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Sandy removed her ballet shoes" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a simple sentence with a subject ("Sandy"), a verb ("removed") and an object ("her ballet shoes"). Additionally, the word order is correct, as well as the use of possessive pronouns and plural countable nouns.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Other Category	The sentence appears to be grammatically correct and conveys a clear meaning. It does not have any errors in syntax, semantics, or morphology.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct and well-structured with proper subject-verb agreement, tense consistency, and clear meaning. No errors related to syntax, semantics, morphology, or other issues have been identified.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Everyone hoped that she would sing" follows the rules of syntax in English grammar. It has a subject ("everyone"), a verb ("hoped") and an object ("she would sing"). The tense is consistent throughout the sentence as well.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "This proved a decisive factor" is grammatically correct. It consists of a noun phrase ("this") followed by a verb in past tense ("proved"), an adjective ("decisive"), and a noun ("factor"). The subject-verb agreement is also correct as "proved" agrees with its singular subject "this". Therefore, there are no syntax errors in this sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Semantics	The sentence is grammatically correct but semantically incorrect as crocodiles do not eat doughnuts. This type of error falls under the category of semantics because it involves meaning rather than grammar.	The sentence is already correct, but if we want to change the object for a more plausible scenario, it could be: "The crocodile devoured the zebra."
1	Syntax	The sentence "John is afraid of Bill" is grammatically correct and well-formed in English. It follows standard subject-verb-object word order and has appropriate tense agreement between the verb and its subjects ("John" and "is"). Additionally, it uses a preposition ("of") with its object ("Bill"), forming a prepositional phrase that modifies the verb. All elements necessary for meaning are present in the sentence as well; therefore, there do not appear to be any semantic errors. Furthermore, no morphological issues can be detected because all words are spelled correctly and inflected appropriately according to their intended meanings within context. Therefore, I conclude that the sentence is syntactically sound.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence "John put under the bathtub" is grammatically incorrect because it lacks a preposition indicating where John put something. A corrected version could be "John put something under the bathtub" or "John placed himself under the bathtub," depending on context.	John put something under the bathtub.
1	Syntax	The sentence "John placed Kim behind the garage" is grammatically correct. It follows the standard Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) word order in English. In this case, "John" is the subject, "placed" is the verb, and "Kim" is the object. Additionally, the prepositional phrase "behind the garage" correctly modifies the location where Kim was placed.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	In this case, the sentence is syntactically incorrect because it lacks a preposition such as "on" after the word "depends". The corrected version would be "Kim depends on Sandy."	Kim depends on Sandy.
1	Syntax	The sentence follows the standard Subject-Verb-Object structure in English where 'John' is the subject, 'put' is the verb and 'the book in the box' is the object. All words used are correctly conjugated for tense and number agreement.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntactically Correct	The sentence follows the rules of English syntax as it has a clear subject ("John"), verb ("taught") and object ("English Syntax"). It also contains prepositional phrases with proper structure ("to new students").	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "John regards Bill as a good friend" follows proper syntactic rules for constructing an English sentence. It contains a subject ("John"), a verb ("regards"), and two objects ("Bill" and "a good friend"). The word order is correct, making it grammatically sound.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Kim put in the box" is grammatically correct, with a clear subject ("Kim"), verb ("put"), and object ("the box").	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	This sentence follows the rules of syntax for English grammar. It has a subject ("the chickens"), verb ("seem"), and object ("of the farmer"). Each part agrees with each other in number and person.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence follows the correct syntax rules for forming a grammatical sentence in English. It has a subject ("the rules"), a verb ("require") and an object ("that the executives be polite").	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The subject of the second clause, "Bill", should be placed before the verb "nominated". Also, there is a missing definite article before "Fred".	The sentence should be: "That Fred was unpopular, Bill nominated him."
1	Syntax	The sentence "They were taking a hard look at possible FTA" is grammatically correct. It consists of a noun phrase ("they"), a verb phrase ("were taking a hard look") and a prepositional phrase ("at possible FTA"). All of these elements are used correctly in terms of syntax.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Semantics	The sentence "John paid me against the book" is grammatically correct but semantically incorrect because it does not make logical sense. It seems like the intended meaning might be that John paid for a book, but instead, it implies that John paid me in exchange for taking something away from the book, such as removing a lien or debt attached to the book, which is unlikely. Therefore, we need to modify the sentence to convey the intended meaning clearly.	The corrected sentence could be "John paid me for the book," indicating that John gave money to acquire the book, or "John paid off the book," suggesting that he settled any debts owed on the book before giving it to someone else.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct and well-structured with proper subject-verb agreement, appropriate use of tenses, and no apparent spelling errors.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The verb "made" in the sentence requires an object to follow it directly without using a preposition such as "be". A corrected version could be "We made them rude", "We made them be quiet" etc.	We made them rude.
1	Syntax	The sentence "After reading the pamphlet, Judy threw it into the garbage can." is grammatically correct. It follows the rules for word order in an English sentence (subject-verb-object), has proper punctuation, and all words are spelled correctly.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The verb in this sentence should agree with its subject in number. In this case, the subject is "students," which is plural. Therefore, the verb should also be in its plural form ("read" instead of "reads").	Students studying English read Conrad's Heart of Darkness while at university.
1	Other Category	The sentence is missing a definite or indefinite article before "book". A more grammatically correct version would be "I read some of the book" if referring to a specific book, or "I read some of a book" if it doesn't matter which book specifically. However, without context it is difficult to determine whether either of these options is necessary. For simplicity, we will assume the original sentence is acceptable with an implied generic meaning, but technically speaking it could use improvement.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Most of the fruit is rotten" is grammatically correct. The subject "most of the fruit" is plural, and the verb "is" agrees with it in number. Additionally, the word "rotten" correctly describes the state of the fruit.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The subject of the sentence is "Neither of students," but there's no verb agreement between the singular form "neither" and plural form "students". To make it grammatically correct, we need to use a plural verb. Here's how to fix it: "Neither of the students failed."	Neither of the students failed.
0	Syntax	In English, we use an article ("a" or "an" for singular nouns, or "the" for all nouns) before a countable singular noun. So in this case, it should be "some water", but since "water" is uncountable, it's more common to say "I had some water".	The corrected sentence could either be "I drank some water" if we want to keep the verb "drank", or "I had some water" if we prefer using the past tense of "have" with uncountable nouns such as "water".
0	Syntax	The noun phrase "a golden hair" is incorrect because "hair" should be plural ("hairs") since it is preceded by the indefinite article "a".	The sentence should be: "It is some golden hairs." Alternatively, if there is only one strand of hair being referred to, then the sentence should be: "It is a gold-colored hair."
1	Syntax	This sentence follows all the rules of syntax for an English sentence. It has a noun ("boy") and verb ("waved"), as well as appropriate modifiers ("in the doorway" describes where the boy was located), and an object ("his father").	The sentence is already correct.
0	Semantics	The sentence is grammatically correct but logically inconsistent because a dog cannot bite itself while being ferocious towards other things at the same time. This type of error falls under semantic errors as it does not convey accurate meaning despite having proper grammar and word forms.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The verb 'washed' requires an object pronoun such as 'him', 'her', or 'it'. Using a reflexive pronoun such as 'yourself' implies that the subject performed the action on itself. Therefore, in this case, we need to use 'you' instead of 'yourself'.	He washed you.
0	Syntax	The sentence "John is easy to please Kim" is syntactically incorrect because it lacks a preposition such as 'for' after 'easy'. It can be rewritten as either "John is easy to please** for **Kim" or "John is easy to **please**. The current structure suggests that John himself is being pleased by Kim, rather than expressing that John finds it easy to please Kim.	The sentence should be corrected as "John is easy to please for Kim" or "John is easy to please".
0	Syntax	The sentence is missing a main verb. A complete predicate is necessary for a grammatically correct sentence. In this case, it seems like the speaker wants to say there seemed to be something or someone who/that is intelligent, but the object is missing in the sentence.	The sentence should be "There seemed to be something or someone intelligent."
1	Syntax	The sentence "John tried to please Stephen" follows the correct syntax rules for an English sentence. It has a subject ("John"), a verb tense indicating past action ("tried"), and an object ("Stephen").	The sentence is already correct.
0	Semantics	The sentence is semantically incorrect because it asserts an implausible meaning. A person cannot be equated with an inanimate object such as a "fountain in the park".	The sentence is not correct. Here's a possible correction: "We believed John to be near the fountain in the park."
0	Syntax	The subject "it" does not have a clear antecedent in the sentence, making it unclear what or who is trying to leave the country. A clarifying noun or pronoun should be used as the subject to specify what is attempting to leave the country.	The dog tries to leave the country.
1	Syntax	The sentence "John tries to leave the country" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "John", a proper noun in the third person singular present tense form ("tries") indicating that he performs an action repeatedly or continually. The verb "to leave" follows the infinitive marker "to". The object of the preposition "the country" correctly follows the preposition "leave". Therefore, there are no syntax errors in the sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Semantics	The sentence is grammatically correct but semantically incorrect as it suggests that the area under the bed might inherently possess the quality of being a fun place to hide, whereas in reality, whether an area is suitable for hiding depends on external factors rather than its own essential characteristics.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The verb "is" does not agree with its subject "there". It should be "There are believed to be sheep in the park.", because the plural noun "sheep" requires a plural form of the verb "to be".	There are believed to be sheep in the park.
0	Syntax	The word "would" is used incorrectly after the verb "hope". It should be a base form of the verb instead, so it should be "I hope to study in France."	I hope to study in France.
1	Syntax	The sentence follows the rules for English syntax, with a clear subject ("John"), verb ("can kick"), and object ("the ball").	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	In English, we cannot say "John will rain tomorrow" because it violates subject-verb agreement rule - the subject "John" is singular but the verb "rain" used here is in its plural form. The correct way to express this idea would be "John will play in the rain tomorrow" or "It will rain tomorrow".	It will rain tomorrow.
0	Syntax	The word "expect" in this context requires a noun or pronoun as its complement, rather than an infinitive verb form such as "will rain". A correct way to express this idea would be "We expect it to rain." or "We expect rain.", among others.	We expect it to rain.
1	Other Category	The sentence "John was found in the office" is grammatically and semantically correct. Therefore, it falls under the other category as there is no error in syntax, morphology, or semantics.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains an error in subject-auxiliary inversion. In questions, an auxiliary verb such as "do," "does," or "did" must come before the subject when the main verb does not have its own tense form, which is the case with the verb "be." Therefore, the correct sentence should be "Did the child **is** in the school?" but it would still sound unnatural because we usually use simple present or past tenses for statements about whether someone or something is or was somewhere: "Is the child in school?" or "Was the child in school?"	Is the child in school?
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct in terms of syntax as it follows the rules for forming an English sentence with a finite verb ("did not rain") and a subject ("it").	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence "John wants not to leave the town" contains a negative concord error in standard English. Here, using both "wants" and "not" creates redundancy as it conveys the same meaning twice. Instead, we can use either "doesn't want to leave" or "wants not to stay".	John doesn't want to leave the town.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct as it follows the rules for subject-verb agreement and word order in English. It contains two independent clauses connected by a conjunction ("but"), each with its own subject and verb.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence 'They needn't take this exam.' is grammatically correct but it can be improved for clarity. Instead of using the contraction 'needn't', it would be clearer to use 'do not need to'. This makes the meaning more explicit and helps avoid confusion with homophones such as 'need not'.	The sentence can be improved by rephrasing it as follows: 'They do not need to take this exam.'
1	Other Category	The sentence "Ann may spend her vacation in Italy" is grammatically correct and conveys a clear meaning. It does not have any issues with syntax, semantics, or morphology.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "They love to play golf, but I do not" follows the rules of English syntax. It contains a independent clause "They love to play golf," connected by a coordinating conjunction "but" to another independent clause "I do not". Each clause has a subject ("they", "I") and verb ("love", "do not"). Additionally, there is proper use of punctuation with a comma after the first independent clause before the coordinating conjunction.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is polar interrogative, meaning it expects a "yes" or "no" answer. It contains an auxiliary verb "has" before the subject "he", making it grammatically correct in terms of subject-auxiliary inversion required for such questions in English. Also, there is a tag question at the end ("hasn't he?"), which refers back to the main clause and checks for confirmation. This too follows syntactic rules correctly.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains an error in its verb tense usage. "Scarcely could" is used to express something that was unlikely to happen in the past; however, it does not make sense when referring to a present or future state as in this case ("as a statesman"). A more appropriate way to phrase this would be "As a statesman, he can barely do anything worth mentioning," using "can barely" instead to indicate current difficulty with doing something notable.	The sentence I provided earlier, "As a statesman, he can barely do anything worth mentioning," is the corrected version of the original sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct and follows the rules of English syntax. It has a subject ("we"), an auxiliary verb ("never"), a main verb in past tense form ("found") and an object ("any of the unicorns").	The sentence is already correct.
1	Other Category	The sentence is grammatically correct, and the meaning is clear. The morphological form of the words is also appropriate. Therefore, there are no issues with syntax, semantics, or morphology.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence appears to be grammatically correct with proper subject-verb agreement, word order, and punctuation. All words seem to be used in their appropriate forms according to their intended meanings.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure in English. In this case, "the car" is the subject, "was" is the verb, and there isn't an explicit object in this sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Other Category	The sentence "Ricky can be relied on" is grammatically correct and has a clear meaning. It falls under the category of idiomatic expressions in English where certain verbs can take on different meanings when used with specific prepositions. In this case, "rely on" means to have confidence in someone's ability or reliability. Therefore, there is no error in syntax, semantics, or morphology.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The past participle form of a verb can be used as an adjective to describe the subject of the sentence. In this case, "slept" describes "the bed". Therefore, there's no syntax error in this sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The subject ("a pound") and the verb ("was weighed") do not agree in number. In this context, a more appropriate way to phrase the sentence would be "The pound was weighed using the book" or "The book weighed the pound".	The pound was weighed using the book.
0	Syntax	The sentence is missing a question mark at the end, making it grammatically incorrect.	Who do you think Tom saw?
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct, with a proper subject-verb agreement and correct use of tense.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The pronoun "her" in this sentence does not have a clear antecedent. It's unclear who "her" refers to. A possible correction could be "Fed knows which politician she will vote for" or "Fed knows which politician to vote for".	Fed knows which politician she will vote for.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a question word ("how") but it is structured as a declarative statement rather than an interrogative sentence. In order for the sentence to be grammatically correct, it should start with "How did he fix the computer?" instead.	How did he fix the computer?
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the rules for subject-verb agreement, word order, and punctuation in English. It contains a complex noun phrase ("whose efforts to achieve peace") functioning as the direct object of the verb "honor," but this does not make the sentence ungrammatical.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence is missing an "'s" at the end of "friend". It should be "Which house does your friend's live?" or "In which house does your friend live?" if asking for a specific house is intended.	In which house does your friend live?
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct. It uses a relative clause ("from whom I bought these bagels") to modify the noun "baker". This structure is syntactically valid in English.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Other Category	The sentence appears to be grammatically correct and semantically meaningful. It has a clear subject ("I"), verb ("found"), and object ("the place") and expresses a complete thought. Additionally, it uses appropriate words for its intended meaning.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The preposition "with" only needs to be used once after the verb "in love". Therefore, the correct sentence would be "Jack is the person whom Jenny fell in love with" or simply "Jack is the person Jenny fell in love with", since who(m)/that can often be omitted when it's clear from context.	Jack is the person Jenny fell in love with.
1	Other Category	The sentence is grammatically correct and conveys the intended meaning clearly. It follows proper syntax rules, has appropriate semantic relations between its components, and all words used in it are morphologically well-formed. Therefore, there's no specific issue related to syntax, semantics, or morphology.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is correctly structured with proper subject-verb agreement and word order. It has a clear subject ("I"), verb ("met"), and an embedded relative clause ("who grows peaches") modifying the noun phrase "the man".	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a pronoun ("his") with no clear antecedent. It's unclear who "his" refers to in this context. This can be corrected by rephrasing the sentence or adding a clarifying clause. For example: "Which topic did you choose without getting his approval for it?"	Which topic did you choose without getting approval from him for it?
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a pronoun "which" without an explicit antecedent. It's unclear what specific topic the speaker got bored with since there's no clear noun referred to by "which". A corrected version could be: "Which topic did you get bored with because Mary talked about it for so long?"	Which topic did you get bored with because Mary talked about it for so long?
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct and well-formed. The subject “he” has a corresponding verb “resigned,” and there is a clear relationship between them established by the preposition “why.” Additionally, the word order follows standard English rules.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Semantics	The sentence "It bothers me that John coughs" is grammatically correct but the meaning behind it can be unclear in certain contexts. For example, if a person says "it bothers me" without specifying what exactly is bothering them, then the listener might get confused about the cause of the problem. In order to avoid confusion, some people prefer to say something like "John's constant coughing bothers me". However, there is nothing inherently wrong with using the original formulation - as long as the speaker clarifies who or what they are referring to when saying "it bothers me", the sentence will make perfect sense.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The subject-verb agreement in this sentence is incorrect. In the original sentence, "to please" serves as a verb, but it is treated as if it were the subject of the sentence. However, the actual subject is missing. A proper correction would be to include a clear subject. For example: "It is easy to please John."	It is easy to please John.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Kim is eager to please Tom" is grammatically correct. It follows the standard subject-verb-object structure in English with no missing words or incorrect verb tenses.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence "That we invaded Iraq really bites" is grammatically incorrect because the subject ("that we invaded Iraq") does not match with the verb ("bites"). In general, abstract concepts such as a fact or idea cannot be the subject of a verb that implies physical action. Here, "that we invaded Iraq" is an abstract concept whereas "bites" suggests a physical action.	The sentence should either read "It really bites that we invaded Iraq," or it could simply say "We invading Iraq was a mistake."
0	Syntax	In this sentence, there is a pronoun "it" at the beginning without a clear antecedent, making it difficult for the reader to understand what specifically is annoying the speaker. A better way to structure this sentence would be: "Fido's barking annoys me."	The corrected sentence is: "Fido's barking annoys me."
0	Syntax	The subject-verb agreement in the sentence is incorrect. The verb 'was' does not agree with its plural subject 'who'. It should be 'were'.	The subjects who achieved the best results were Angela and Jamie.
1	Syntax	The sentence "It was the peasant girl who got it" is grammatically correct. The word order follows standard English syntax rules, with a clear subject ("the peasant girl") and verb ("got"). Additionally, the relative clause "who got it" provides additional information about the subject in a grammatically correct way.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The error in this sentence is related to subject-verb agreement. In the phrase "anyone to look after," the singular verb form ("is") does not agree with its plural subject ("anyone").	The corrected sentence would be: "That kind of person is hard to find anyone who can look after them."
0	Semantics	The sentence is grammatically correct but its meaning is incorrect because owls that are sick can still hunt for food.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in this sentence. The verb "will be" should agree with its plural subject "candidates," so it should be changed to "will be admitted."	Each candidate who has an interest in semantics will be admitted to the department.
0	Syntax	In this sentence, we have an agreement error between subject ("any language") and verb ("is"). The plural form of the verb "be" must be used with a plural noun. Therefore, the correct form should be "are".	Each author whose contribution is written in any languages will provide a summary in English.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a subject-verb agreement error. The word "we" is plural while "got" is singular. It should be changed to "have gotten" instead for proper grammar.	The sentence should read as follows: "I'm sure we have even gotten these tickets!"
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a double negative ("even" and "got"), which can create confusion and makes the sentence incorrect. A more appropriate way to express uncertainty would be using a single negative term such as "I'm not even sure we have these tickets!" or simply stating it positively without any negations: "I'm confident we have these tickets!"	I'm confident we have these tickets!
0	Syntax	The word "urban" in this context should be hyphenated because it modifies a noun ("guerrillas") that follows it. A correct version would be: "It's not because I have any sympathy for urban-guerrillas that I helped him."	The sentence is already correct after making the change to "It's not because I have any sympathy for urban-guerrillas that I helped him."
0	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically correct but it can be made clearer by adding a conjunction such as 'but' between 'that' and 'I'm'. This would make the logical relationship between the clauses more explicit.	It isn't because Sue said anything bad about me that, but rather, I'm angry for some other reason.
0	Syntax	In English grammar, a comma splice occurs when two independent clauses are joined by only a comma. This results in a run-on sentence. The sentence "That he was hungry, John whined" contains a comma splice because it joins the independent clause "that he was hungry" with the independent clause "John whined" using just a comma.	The correct sentence could be either "He was hungry, so John whined" or "That he was hungry, John began to whine," where the first independent clause is connected to the second independent clause through coordination ("so") or subordination ("that...whined"). Alternatively, we can simply use a period instead of a comma to divide them into separate sentences: "That he was hungry. John whined."
0	Syntax	The sentence has incorrect word order in its structure. In English grammar, indirect objects typically come before direct objects. Therefore, the correct form would be: "I gave a book to Mary after the party" or simply "I gave Mary a book after the party".	I gave a book to Mary after the party.
0	Syntax	The clause "as for Mary I really like her" is incorrectly constructed. A more appropriate way to express this sentiment would be "As for Mary, I really like her."	As for Mary, I really like her.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct, with a clear subject ("he") and predicate ("may hate those that criticize Carter, it doesn't matter"). Additionally, the subordinating conjunction "though" connects two independent clauses effectively.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence "With no job would John be happy." is grammatically incorrect because it lacks a proper verb tense agreement between "be" and "would". Also, there's missing main verb in the sentence.	The corrected sentence could be: "John wouldn't be happy without a job."
0	Syntax	The correct form of this sentence would be "I have **much** of the manuscript **left to type**". In this case, we use 'much' with uncountable nouns ('manuscript') and countable singular nouns when they refer to an amount that can't be divided into separate parts. So here, it's grammatically incorrect to use 'of the'. Instead, we say 'left to type', indicating there is still some remaining part of the manuscript that needs typing.	The sentence is almost correct but should read as follows for better grammar: "I have much of the manuscript left to type" -> "I have much of the manuscript left to typed."
1	Other Category	The sentence "He's a more reliable man" is grammatically correct and has a clear meaning. Therefore, there are no syntax, semantic, or morphological errors in this sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The word "what" cannot be used in this way at the beginning of a sentence. A better way to express this idea would be "I don't want any trouble."	The sentence "Any trouble is what I don't want." is incorrect. The corrected version is "I don't want any trouble."
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct but there is a missing context. Bamboo can refer to different things such as the plant itself or tall structures made from it. Without additional information about what specifically they could be growing as high as, I cannot definitively say if the sentence is semantically correct. However, syntactically speaking, the structure and grammar of the sentence are both correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The subject-verb agreement in the sentence is incorrect. The plural noun "some" requires a verb in the plural form ("made" instead of "make").	Some of them made as many errors as twenty. (Note: I changed '20' to 'twenty', since it is more common to use the word than the number.)
0	Syntax	The reflexive pronoun used in the sentence, "himself", does not agree with the subject "Sally". In English, a reflexive pronoun must agree in number and gender with its antecedent. Here, an appropriate form would be "herself".	The corrected sentence is "Sally kissed herself."
0	Semantics	The sentence is grammatically correct but semantically there seems to be a problem with the object of belief. It's unclear what exactly Drew believes about your thoughts on Rosie loving magazine ads. Is he aware of it? Does he doubt it? Or is it just an expression of his own opinion? More context is needed for clarity. However, if we assume that the intended meaning is simply expressing the speaker's observation of these nested beliefs without any ambiguity, then a possible rewording could be: "Drew realizes that I believe Rosie loves magazine ads."	Let's say 'Drew suspects that I think Rosie has affection towards magazine advertisements.'
1	Syntax	The sentence "Dave, Dan, Erin, Jaime, and Alina left" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules for word order in a simple sentence. The subject of the sentence (Dave, Dan, Erin, Jaime, and Alina) comes before the verb (left), which is in past tense.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct and the word order follows standard English syntax rules.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	In English, subject pronouns such as "she" should be used instead of object pronouns such as "herself" when referring to the subject of a sentence. Here, the error occurs in the use of the reflexive pronoun "herself" instead of the subject pronoun "she". The corrected version would read: "Blue leather shows that she is pretty / Blue leather shows that Betsy is pretty."	Blue leather shows that she is pretty.
1	Syntax	The sentence follows the correct syntax rules for a simple sentence in English. It contains a subject ("Gwen"), an action verb ("hit") and an object ("the baseball").	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The subject-verb agreement in this sentence is incorrect. The verb "hit" does not agree with its plural subject "that you knew". It should be "I hit something you knew".	The sentence should be either "I hit something you knew" or "I struck what you knew", depending on the intended meaning.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct, as it uses proper subject-verb agreement and follows a logical structure. The coordinating conjunction "or" connects two independent clauses, each with its own subject ("I") and verb ("have lost"). This type of construction is common in English for expressing alternatives or disjunctions.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Other Category	The sentence is grammatically correct and the words used in it have been morphologically inflected appropriately. Additionally, the sentence makes sense semantically. Therefore, there are no issues with syntax, semantics, or morphology.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "He likes cookies and he hates crumb cake" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules for subject-verb agreement, word order, and punctuation in English. Additionally, each clause contains a clear subject ("he") and predicate ("likes cookies," "hates crumb cake"), making the meaning easy to understand.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "They chased the man with the car" is grammatically correct, but its meaning can be ambiguous due to the preposition "with". It could mean that they used a car as a tool to chase the man, or it could mean that they chased a man who possesses a car. However, syntactically there is no error in this sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Semantics	The sentence "I didn't have a red cent" is semantically correct because it uses an idiomatic expression in English that means the speaker had no money at all.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The conjunction "and" connects two noun phrases "the book of poems" and "from Blackwell," but it seems like these two noun phrases have different functions in the sentence. I think what you meant to say is something like "Reading the book of poems from Blackwell takes a very long time." In this revised version, both noun phrases modify the verb phrase "takes a very long time to read".	Reading the book of poems from Blackwell takes a very long time.
1	Syntax	The sentence "the one with a red cover takes a very long time to read" is grammatically correct. It follows standard English syntax rules for word order and structure.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Other Category	The sentence "John has a fear of dogs" is grammatically correct and the words used in it are morphologically and syntactically correct as well. Therefore, there are no issues related to syntax, semantics, or morphology in this sentence. Hence, I will categorize it under "Other Category".	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	In English, a noun modified by an adjective generally comes before the verb in a sentence. Therefore, "the building's" and "is leaking" should be next to each other, with "roof" coming between them. Additionally, possessives usually come before articles such as "the," so "building's roof" would be more appropriate than "the building's."	The building's roof is leaking.
0	Syntax	In this sentence, there are two instances of the definite article "the" used before the noun "coat". This is incorrect because we only use the definite article once when referring to something for the first time in a sentence. The corrected version would be: "The panther's coat is dark black."	The panther's coat is dark black.
1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically correct as it follows the rules for word order and structure in English. It contains a subject ("Colin"), an auxiliary verb ("asked"), a direct object ("if they could get a mortgage"), and forms a complete thought.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Semantics	This sentence implies that the man who got into the taxi is the same person who later robbed the bank. If the speaker is suggesting a sequence of events where they witnessed someone getting into a cab and then discovered a robbery at a bank committed by another person, the sentence structure does not convey it clearly. It creates ambiguity in semantic interpretation due to its implied causal relationship between two unrelated actions. Confused with the chain of events? Let me clarify the issue for better understanding. Original Sentence: *The man I saw get into the cab robbed the bank.* Clearer Sentences:  a.) *"I saw the man get into the cab, and then I found out he had robbed the bank."* b.) *"The man who robbed the bank earlier was seen getting into a cab afterwards."*	The sentence requires rephrasing based on context rather than having an inherently wrong grammatical structure; thus, no single 'correct' version can be provided here without more information about what actually happened. However, please refer to my suggested clearer sentences as potential alternatives depending upon intended meaning.
1	Syntax	The sentence "I know you eat asparagus" is grammatically correct. The subject "I" is correctly linked to the verb "know", indicating the speaker's knowledge about something. The second person pronoun "you" is used appropriately with the verb "eat". Lastly, the object "asparagus" follows the verb "eat" properly.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "John's drum will always bother me" is grammatically correct in terms of syntax as it follows the rules for word order and structure in English. It consists of a noun phrase ("John's drum") serving as the subject, an auxiliary verb ("will") indicating future tense, and a main verb ("bother") with its direct object complement ("me").	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically correct as it follows the rules of word order and structure in English. It consists of a noun phrase ("an evil thought"), an auxiliary verb ("struck"), and a proper noun ("Dave"). All elements are grammatically correct and combined appropriately.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "In the classroom John put the book on the table" is grammatically correct, with a clear subject ("John"), verb ("put"), and object ("the book"). The prepositional phrases "in the classroom" and "on the table" provide additional context for where the action took place.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Phillip gave the medal to the soldier" is grammatically correct and follows proper syntax rules for word order in an English sentence. It has a clear subject ("Phillip"), verb ("gave"), and object ("the medal") as well as a prepositional phrase indicating the recipient of the action ("to the soldier").	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a syntax error because it lacks the verb for the infinitive "to eat". It should be "Andy to eat **something**", but currently there's no object after "eat". A correct version could be "Heidi thinks that Andy is going to eat salmon-flavored candy bars" or "Heidi thinks that Andy wants to eat salmon-flavored candy bars".	The sentence is not already correct. Here's a corrected version with semantic improvements as well: "Heidi believes that Andy plans to consume salmon-flavored candy bars."
0	Semantics	The sentence is grammatically correct but semantically odd because it's unusual for someone to think that another person should eat candies with an unconventional flavor such as salmon. This statement could be considered a pragmatic anomaly since there's no apparent reason why Heidi would suggest this particular flavor for Andy to consume. However, if we disregard the peculiarity of the suggested action and focus solely on grammatical structure, then the sentence is indeed correct.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "He danced" is grammatically correct. It consists of a pronoun subject ("he") followed by a verb in past tense ("danced").	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	In English, when using auxiliary verbs such as "do" in questions, we need to invert the order of subject and verb. Therefore, a more grammatically correct way to ask the question would be "Did Calvin do his homework?" rather than "Did Calvin his homework?". The former correctly conveys the intended meaning while adhering to standard English syntax rules.	Did Calvin do his homework?
1	Syntax	The sentence "Sylvia was slapping Jeff upside the head in martial arts class" is grammatically correct. It follows the rules of English syntax, including proper word order and subject-verb agreement.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is correctly structured in terms of syntax as it follows the rules for forming an English sentence. It has a subject ("I"), a verb ("would buy"), and an object ("a diamond ring"). Additionally, there is a conditional clause at the beginning of the sentence ("If I am a rich man") which sets up the condition under which the action described in the main clause would occur.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "If he were a rich man, he'd buy a diamond ring" is grammatically correct. It uses the subjunctive mood correctly to express a hypothetical situation.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "John is likely to leave" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "John", and the verb is "is likely to leave". This forms a complete thought, with "John" being the person who is likely to leave. Therefore, there are no syntax errors in this sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	This sentence has a simple subject-verb-object structure with proper agreement between the subject ("manager") and verb ("laughed"). It follows standard English syntax rules for word order and form.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence "Was sunk" is missing a subject, making it grammatically incorrect and incomplete. A proper sentence requires both a subject and a verb at the very least.	The sentence is not correct. It could be corrected as follows: "The ship was sunk," assuming there needs to be a reference to something being sunk.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a mistake in its structure. Specifically, there's an incorrect use of the tense of the verb "think". It should be either "do you think" or "did you think", depending on whether the speaker wants to ask about the present or past action. Additionally, it would sound more natural if we replace "who did you think" with "who do you think".	"Who do you think kissed the gorilla?" or "Did you think someone kissed the gorilla?"
1	Other Category	The sentence is grammatically correct, has a clear meaning, and follows the rules for word formation in English. Therefore, there are no issues with syntax, semantics, or morphology.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Semantics	The sentence appears grammatically correct, but without additional context it's difficult to determine if the semantics are being used accurately. In general terms, 'mugging' refers to a robbery in which force or threats are used. Therefore, saying 'Lucy was mugged' implies that something happened to her directly involving violence or intimidation for theft purposes. Without further information about what actually occurred, we cannot definitively say whether the semantic meaning here is accurate.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "I ate a salad that was filled with lima beans" is grammatically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "There were four men arriving at the station when I pulled up" is grammatically correct. The subject-auxiliary inversion ("were...arriving") is used correctly to form a question within a dependent clause ("when I pulled up"). This construction creates a complex sentence with two clauses, both of which have appropriate syntax.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Jean is reluctant to dance" is grammatically correct. It follows the standard Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) word order in English. The subject "Jean" is followed by a linking verb "is," which is then followed by the adjective "reluctant." Finally, there's an infinitival verb phrase "to dance" as the object.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "I want her to dance" follows the rules of subject-verb-object word order in English, where "I" is the subject, "want" is the verb, and "her to dance" is the object. Additionally, the pronoun "her" correctly agrees with its antecedent in number and gender.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Jean persuaded Robert" is grammatically correct. The subject "Jean" is followed by a verb "persuaded" and an object "Robert," making it a simple sentence with proper syntax.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Jean wants Bill to do the Macarena" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Jean," who is expressed as wanting something. This want is indicated by the verb "wants." Following this verb is an infinitive phrase, "to do the Macarena," which indicates what Jean wants Bill to do. Each word in the sentence has a clear role and contributes to the overall meaning, making it grammatical.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a simple sentence in English: subject ("the children") + verb ("admire") + object ("their mother").	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence "Who has Peter talked with?" is grammatically correct but it requires an inversion for a question formation. It would be more appropriate as "With whom has Peter talked?" if we strictly follow the rule of subject-auxiliary verb inversion in wh-questions. However, because using "who" instead of "whom" is common in informal speech and writing nowadays, I will consider this sentence acceptable in modern English usage. Thus, my decision here is based on traditional grammar rules.	With whom has Peter talked? OR Who did Peter talk with?
1	Syntax	The sentence "Heidi likes her violin" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object word order in English and uses proper pronouns and articles.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Semantics	The error in this sentence is semantic in nature because it relates to the meaning of the words used. In particular, the pronoun 'himself' does not agree with its antecedent 'John'. The pronoun should be 'he', so the sentence should read 'John thinks that Mary loves him.' instead.	The sentence should be 'John thinks that Mary loves him.'
0	Syntax	The possessive form "himself" should be replaced with a regular object pronoun "he". This error is related to syntax because it has to do with how words are arranged in a sentence.	Which pictures of he does John like? (Note: The corrected sentence I provided is still grammatically incorrect; ideally, it would say "Which pictures of him does John like?")
0	Syntax	The subject "Any" in this context requires a plural noun, so it should be "owls" instead of "owl". Also, there needs to be an article before "mice", making it "the mice".	Any owls hunt the mice.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a double negative ("any" and "didn't"), which results in a logically inconsistent statement. In English, using two negatives can sometimes result in an affirmative meaning, but here it makes the sentence ungrammatical.	Either use "Any man ate dinner" or "No man ate dinner".
1	Other Category	The sentence is grammatically correct, and the meaning it conveys is clear. It follows proper syntax rules and has appropriate word choice.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct. It uses a relative clause ("whoever they were") to modify the noun phrase "everybody who attended last week's huge rally," indicating that all those people signed the petition. This construction is called a sentential relative clause because it can be removed without affecting the grammaticality of the rest of the sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct and well-constructed. It follows the standard subject-verb-object structure and all elements in the sentence agree with each other in terms of tense, number, and person. Additionally, there are no missing words, punctuation errors, or spelling mistakes.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Semantics	The statement "Any tiger has orange fur, marked with black stripes" contains a generalization about all tigers having orange fur with black stripes. However, there are some exceptions in reality where certain subspecies have different colored fur such as white tigers. Therefore, it would be more accurate to say "Most tigers have orange fur, typically marked with black stripes," instead of using an absolute term like 'any'.	Most tigers have orange fur, typically marked with black stripes.
0	Semantics	Albinism in animals results in a lack of pigmentation, causing white fur in tigers instead of orange fur. Therefore, it's incorrect to say "Any albino tiger has orange fur."	The sentence is not correct. A more accurate statement would be "Any albino tiger has white fur, sometimes marked with black stripes."
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a correctly constructed simple sentence with a subject ("you") and an imperative verb ("must pick"). However, there is a missing article before "flower". In English, we need an indefinite article "a" before a singular countable noun when it's used for the first time in a sentence. Therefore, the corrected sentence would be: "You must pick a flower you see."	The sentence is already correct after adding an indefinite article 'a': "You must pick a flower you see."
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct but it contains an ambiguity in meaning due to the use of the word "this". It can mean either "any pilot currently working" or "the specific plane being discussed". To avoid confusion, a more precise phrasing such as "Any pilot who is on duty today might be operating this particular aircraft" would be better. However, since there is no clear grammatical error, I will still mark this as correct for syntax.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct and well-structured with no errors in subject-verb agreement, tense consistency, pronoun reference, etc. It has a clear subject ("you"), verb ("pick"), and object ("every flower"). Additionally, it contains an adverbial clause "but leave a few for Mary" providing additional information about the action without interrupting the flow of thought.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is structurally sound and both clauses follow the proper subject-verb agreement. The coordinating conjunction "and" connects two independent clauses correctly.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The label is 0 because the sentence is grammatically correct.	This question uses standard English grammar and contains a subject ("the man"), an auxiliary verb ("was"), a main verb in past tense form ("seen") and a prepositional phrase ("in which car"). It forms a coherent interrogative sentence with no apparent errors.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	In this sentence, there is a coordination between two verb phrases ("loves" and "hates") with different subjects ("Mary" and "Sally"). This type of construction requires the use of two separate sentences or the addition of additional words to clarify the meaning. A possible correction would be: "The man whom both Mary loves and Sally hates computed my tax."	The sentence is not correct as it stands; see explanation for suggested correction.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct and well-constructed. It follows the rules for subject-verb agreement, word order, and punctuation.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Tom said he would and Bill actually did eat a raw eggplant" is grammatically correct. It contains two independent clauses ("Tom said he would" and "Bill actually did eat a raw eggplant") connected by a coordinating conjunction ("and"). Each clause has a subject and a verb, and they express complete thoughts.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct and well-structured with a subject ("the wealthy young man"), verb ("bought"), and object ("that piano"). Additionally, there are no obvious spelling errors or punctuation issues.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically correct because it follows the standard structure of a simple sentence in English with a subject ("the dog"), verb ("stole") and object ("the turkey"). All words are used appropriately in their proper forms, without any spelling errors.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Other Category	The sentence "a tall building" is grammatically correct but it is an incomplete sentence because it lacks a main verb. A complete sentence must have at least a subject and a predicate. In this case, there is only a noun phrase "a tall building".	The sentence is already correct if we add a main verb to make it a complete sentence, such as "The building is a tall one."
1	Other Category	The sentence "This building is tall" is grammatically correct in English with no errors in syntax, morphology, or semantics.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "I like the book which you gave me" is grammatically correct. It follows standard English syntax rules for forming a sentence with a subject ("I"), a verb ("like"), and an object ("the book"). Additionally, it includes a relative clause ("which you gave me") that modifies the noun phrase "the book". This clause follows the required structure by including a relative pronoun ("which"), a verb ("gave"), and its own object ("me").	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Captain Wentworth wrote a letter to Anne Elliott" follows the standard structure of an English sentence with a subject ("Captain Wentworth"), verb ("wrote"), and object ("a letter"). It has proper capitalization at the beginning of the sentence and end punctuation. The word order is grammatically correct, making it syntactically sound.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	In English, an auxiliary verb such as "was" should come before the subject when forming a question. The correct form of the sentence would be "She asked **whether** Alison was coming to the party." or simply "Was Alison coming to the party?"	Was Alison coming to the party?
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct. The word 'realized' is in past tense, agreeing with its subject 'they'. Also, there is a subordinating conjunction 'that', connecting two clauses together correctly. In addition, the verb form 'had been' shows the third person singular ('Sir Thomas') has taken part in an action completed in the past, indicating perfect aspect. Therefore, no error exists in terms of syntax.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is correctly structured in terms of syntax, as it follows the rules for word order and arrangement in a well-formed English sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Knowing the country well, he took a shortcut" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules for subject-verb agreement and word order in English. The clause "knowing the country well" functions as an adverbial phrase modifying the main verb "took". This type of construction where a subordinate clause comes before the main clause is called an inverted sentence structure and it's commonly used in English.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "He left the train with somebody else's wallet in his pocket" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules for word order and agreement between subject and verb. Additionally, all words are spelled correctly, punctuation marks are used appropriately, and there are no awkward phrases or ambiguities in meaning.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Other Category	The sentence "Magnus went to Ireland" is grammatically correct and conveys a clear meaning. It does not have any issues with syntax, semantics, or morphology. Therefore, it falls under the category of "Other".	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence is missing a question mark at the end to indicate it as a question. In addition, subject-auxiliary inversion is required for yes/no questions in English, so "did" needs to come before "John". A correct version would be: "Did John send the book?"	Did John send the book?
0	Syntax	In this sentence, the word "the" is repeated before "Dome," making it grammatically incorrect.	The idea dismayed the Prime Minister that the Dome was dull.
0	Syntax	In English, it is more common to say "He came right in without even knocking" instead of "he did". The word order after "did" can be improved for better fluency and understanding.	He came right in without even knocking.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Harriet admired Mr Knightley" is grammatically correct and follows proper syntax rules for constructing an English sentence. It has a subject ("Harriet"), verb ("admired") and object ("Mr Knightley").	The sentence is already correct.
1	Other Category	This sentence is grammatically correct and the words used have been morphologically and syntactically used correctly. However, it may be subjective whether the book is truly "boring" as that can depend on personal opinion. Therefore, for the purpose of this task, we will consider if the sentence communicates something meaningful and true, rather than just its grammaticality. Here, since "boring" is a matter of opinion, the sentence is still considered grammatically correct but its truth value depends on context.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Other Category	The sentence is grammatically correct, and the words used convey the intended meaning clearly. Additionally, there are no errors in word formation or syntax. Therefore, it falls under the category of 'Other'.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Emma made Harriet some food" is grammatically correct. It follows the standard subject-verb-object structure in English with a clear agent ("Emma"), action ("made"), and patient ("Harriet some food"). Additionally, there are no spelling errors, punctuation issues, or word usage problems.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "The window was broken with a hammer" is grammatically correct. The subject "the window" is followed by the linking verb "was," indicating the state of the window. The prepositional phrase "with a hammer" describes the instrument used to break the window.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "The fugitive lay motionless in order to avoid discovery" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules for subject-verb agreement, word order, and tense consistency. The subject "fugitive" agrees with its verb "lay," both in number and person. Additionally, the words are arranged correctly according to their syntactic roles, creating a clear meaning. Lastly, all verbs follow the same time frame, maintaining coherency throughout the sentence. Therefore, no corrections need to be made.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "The guard marched the prisoners round the yard" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a simple sentence with a subject ("The guard"), an auxiliary verb ("marched"), the direct object ("the prisoners") and an adverbial clause ("round the yard").	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Frank Churchill crossed the street" is grammatically correct and well-formed in terms of syntax. It follows a subject-verb-object structure with proper tense agreement between the subject and verb.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Emma and Harriet were attacked yesterday" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a simple sentence with a subject ("Emma and Harriet") and a verb ("were attacked"). Additionally, the tense of the verb agrees with the time expression "yesterday".	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Fiona might be here by 5 o'clock" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Fiona," and the verb tense is appropriate for a possible future action. Additionally, the adverbial clause "by 5 o'clock" provides additional information about when Fiona may arrive.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The conjunction "and" connects two independent clauses in this sentence. However, there is no coordinating conjunction linking the second clause ("of the opinion that it is a desirable one") with its antecedent. To fix this issue, we can use the word "also", resulting in the corrected version: "I am both expecting to get the job and also of the opinion that it is a desirable one."	I am both expecting to get the job and also of the opinion that it is a desirable one.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct but contains a contradiction in meaning. Winning an award such as the Golden Fleece Award would typically be considered an honor or achievement, yet being "very upset" about receiving it suggests dissatisfaction or disappointment. This creates a semantic inconsistency within the sentence.	The sentence is already correct, but for clarity, consider revising it based on the intended meaning. For example: "Pat was reluctantly awarded the Golden Fleece Award and felt very upset about it," or alternatively, "Pat had hoped to win another award instead; he received the Golden Fleece Award and was very disappointed."
0	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically incorrect because there are two verbs ("alienated" and "beating") without a clear subject for the second verb. Additionally, it appears as though the word "and" may be used incorrectly in an attempt to connect two separate clauses. A coordinating conjunction such as "and" typically requires a parallel structure on both sides of the conjunction.	Kim alienated the cats and he beat his dog. OR Kim alienated the cats and was beating his dog.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct and the words are in the right order.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a noun phrase error. It is unclear what "which article" refers to in this context. A more specific noun or pronoun should be used instead.	The sentence is incorrect as written. Here's a possible correction: "Terry filed some papers without reading them first."
1	Other Category	The sentence is grammatically correct but it may be illegal in certain jurisdictions for a person who is underage to purchase alcoholic beverages such as whiskey. Therefore, while the sentence is grammatical, its intended action might not be legal.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a form of the verb “to go” followed by an infinitive (“buying”) without using the infinitive marker “to”. This is incorrect in standard English.	The corrected sentence would be: "She goes and **to** buy some whiskey." OR "She goes to buy some whiskey."
0	Syntax	The subject of the sentence "Kim and Terry" is plural, so the verb must be in its plural form as well. In this case, it should be "are", instead of "is".	Kim and Terry are happy.
1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically correct as it follows the rules for word order and structure in English. It contains two independent clauses connected by the conjunction 'and', with each clause having a subject ('Kim' and 'a dime') and an object ('Bobbie' and 'Jean'). Each clause also has its own verb ('gave' and 'to'), making the overall sentence clear and easy to understand.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct and well-constructed. It follows proper subject-verb agreement, has clear noun phrases with appropriate modifiers, and uses correct prepositions for each object of the actions described.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The first clause of the sentence contains an incorrect use of the word "put" as a command rather than a statement. Additionally, there is no clear subject for the second half of the sentence, making it unclear who the subject is that will be putting a picture of Bill on the desk.	Place a picture of Bill on your desk before tomorrow; then this girl in the red coat will do the same before tomorrow.
1	Syntax	The sentence appears grammatically correct at first glance, but there is actually a small error related to subject-verb agreement. In the clause "this girl in the red coat will put," the verb "will put" does not agree with its singular subject "girl." To fix this issue, we need to change the form of the verb from third person plural ("will put") to third person singular ("will put" becomes "will puts").	The sentence is almost correct; it just needs a minor adjustment for proper subject-verb agreement. Here's the corrected version: "This girl in the red coat will puts a picture of Bill on your desk before tomorrow."
1	Syntax	The sentence appears to be grammatically correct, with a subject ("Ann"), verb ("bought"), and object ("a first edition of Richard III") in a logical order. Additionally, there is a prepositional phrase providing more information about the object, as well as a price stated using appropriate punctuation.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Other Category	The sentence "John became deadly afraid of flying" is grammatically correct, but the word "deadly" in this context can be interpreted as meaning something along the lines of "extremely," rather than its more common usage as referring to death or fatal outcomes. A better choice of words might be "John became extremely afraid of flying" or "John developed a severe fear of flying." However, I will still mark it as correct because "deadly" is sometimes used informally to mean "intensely" or "severely."	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "What John promised is to be gentle" is grammatically correct but has a slightly unusual structure due to the use of the infinitive phrase "to be gentle" as the subject complement. A more common way to express this idea would be "What John promised is gentleness" or "John promised to be gentle". However, since the original sentence is still understandable and grammatically valid, I will mark it as correct with a label of 1 for syntax.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence is missing a question word at the beginning, making it ungrammatical as a standalone question. A suitable question word such as "what" would make the sentence grammatically correct.	What books about cooking does Henri want to buy?
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct but it includes a pronoun ("I") which has been dropped. Including the dropped pronoun would make the subject-verb agreement clearer and improve readability.	I will fix the computer for Carol.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Smith loaned a valuable collection of manuscripts to the library" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an English sentence with a clear subject ("Smith"), verb ("loaned"), and object ("a valuable collection of manuscripts") in addition to properly using prepositions ("to").	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The syntax of the sentence "The paper is cut by Mary" is grammatically correct but semantically it's unclear who or what did the cutting since passive voice is used here. It would be better if the active form is used for clarity, such as "Mary cuts the paper". However, if we assume that the intended meaning is clear in context, then the syntax itself is still technically correct.	I will leave this as-is because the syntax is correct even though the sentence could benefit from being rewritten in a more informative way using active voice.
0	Syntax	The conjunction "or" cannot be used to connect two prepositional phrases in this way. A better way to phrase the sentence would be: "It occurred between six and nine."	The sentence should be: "It occurred from six to nine."
1	Syntax	The sentence "Suddenly, there arrived two inspectors from the INS." is grammatically correct. The adverb "suddenly" modifies the verb "arrived," indicating when the action occurred. The subject "two inspectors" agrees in number with the plural verb "arrived." Additionally, the prepositional phrase "from the INS" clarifies where the inspectors came from, providing more context to the sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	In English grammar, a sentence requires both a subject and a predicate. In this case, the second clause "thickens" lacks a subject, making it incomplete and ungrammatical. A corrected version could be "The soup cooks and thickens," where "the soup" serves as the subject for both clauses.	The soup cooks and thickens.
1	Syntax	The sentence "I gave money to the charity" is grammatically correct. The subject "I" is followed by a verb in past tense "gave", and the indirect object "money" is correctly connected with the preposition "to". Furthermore, the direct object "charity" follows after the preposition. Therefore, there are no syntax errors in this sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Other Category	The sentence "John asked." is grammatically correct but it lacks context to determine its meaning completely. It would be helpful to have more information in order to accurately judge its syntax, semantics, or morphology. However, since no specific issue was identified, I will assume that the sentence is complete enough for this task.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The subject ("I") and verb ("saw") in this sentence are in the correct order, but the object ("even the student") contains an error. In English, we usually use "even" before a word when emphasizing it; therefore, "even" should come before "the," resulting in "even the" being placed next to "student." A corrected version would be "I even saw the student."	I even saw the student.
0	Syntax	The sentence "John whispered Mary left" is syntactically incorrect because it does not specify what John whispered. It can be rewritten as "John whispered a secret" or "John whispered 'goodbye' to Mary", for example.	John whispered something to Mary.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a subjunctive mood but lacks a comma after "wonders". In English, when using a verb such as wonder, think, know etc. followed by "that" clause, we need to add a comma before "that". Therefore, it's grammatically correct to say "Mary wonders whether Bill will come", but if we want to keep the original structure with the subjunctive mood, then the correct form would be "Mary wonders whether, in fact, Bill will come."	Mary wonders whether, in fact, Bill will come.
0	Syntax	The sentence "Sophie will theater" is grammatically incorrect because it lacks a verb in its present tense form. A correct version could be "Sophie will go to the theatre", where "will go" represents the future tense of the verb "to go".	Sophie will go to the theatre.
1	Syntax	The sentence follows the rules of syntax for English language correctly by having a subject ("John"), followed by two verbs ("finished" and "drank") each with its own object ("the cake" and "the lemonade"). Each clause has a clear subject-verb agreement in terms of tense and number.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The subject in this sentence, "Herself," does not make sense because it cannot be the one doing the action since "likes" requires an antecedent as its subject. Additionally, if we replace "herself" with a pronoun that agrees with the gender of "Mary", such as "she", then the sentence becomes grammatically correct but semantically incorrect, implying that she likes her own mother instead of someone else's. Therefore, the original sentence is both syntactically and semantically incorrect.	The sentence is not correct. A possible correction could be "She likes Mary's mother".
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the rules for subject-verb agreement, word order, and tense consistency. It has a clear subject ("each of the boys"), verb ("fought"), and an object ("some of the other boys"). Additionally, there is no ambiguity in meaning as each part of the sentence can be easily understood in context.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Semantics	The pronoun used in the sentence should be "she" instead of "himself". "Himself" refers to a male person whereas "John's mother" is female.	John's mother likes her.
0	Syntax	The pronoun in this sentence should be "herself" instead of "himself", because the subject of the sentence is "Mary". So the corrected sentence would read "Mary revealed herself to John."	The sentence should be "Mary revealed herself to John.", as the original sentence has incorrect pronoun usage.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Mary believes that Bill saw himself" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules for subject-verb agreement and word order in English. It contains a main clause ("Mary believes") and a dependent clause ("Bill saw himself"), both of which have proper structure and punctuation.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "John heard that they criticized themselves" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules for subject-verb agreement and word order in English.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Mary thinks that she is smart" follows the rules of syntax for an English sentence. It contains a subject ("Mary"), a verb ("thinks") and an object clause ("she is smart"). All words used in the sentence have been grammatically applied according to their functions.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Henry found that Bill is sad" is grammatically correct. It consists of a main clause ("Henry found") and a dependent clause ("that Bill is sad"). Both clauses have proper subject-verb agreement and follow the rules of syntax.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The reflexive pronoun "himself" should refer back to the subject of the sentence. In this case, the subject is "John", so a proper usage would be "John considers himself proud". However, if you want to express pride for someone else, use "proud of": "John considers Mary proud". Combining both results in an incorrect sentence structure.	John considers Mary proud.
0	Syntax	The subject-verb agreement in this sentence is incorrect. In this case, "you" is the subject and it requires a plural verb form such as "sit". However, "sits" is used instead, making the verb agree with the object "there", which is grammatically incorrect.	The sentence should be corrected as follows: "You should sit there."
1	Syntax	The sentence "There is a nurse available" is grammatically correct. The subject "a nurse" is followed by the linking verb "is" and the predicate nominative "available". This structure forms a complete thought and follows standard English syntax rules.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The verb "hopes" requires a singular subject, but "everyone" is plural. Additionally, in order for the meaning of the sentence to be clearer, it would need to specify who is doing the hoping and whom they hope will sleep. A possible correction could be "Everyone hopes that each person can get some sleep."	Everyone hopes that each person can get some sleep.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Everyone hopes that he will sleep" is grammatically correct. Pronoun "he" refers to a singular masculine noun, which in this case does not need specification as it's understood who is being referred to by context.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Semantics	The sentence incorrectly implies that only Winston Churchill remembers himself giving the famous "Blood, Sweat and Tears" speech. This creates a semantic inconsistency as more than just Churchill would recall him delivering it. A person can't exclusively remember themselves doing something unless they have some unique condition such as amnesia affecting others but not them.	Many people, including Churchill, remember Churchill giving the Blood, Sweat and Tears speech.
0	Syntax	The error in this sentence lies in subject-verb agreement. In this case, the verb "promise" must agree with its subject "John," so it should be "promises" instead. Additionally, the reflexive pronoun "himself" refers back to the closest preceding noun, but here it should refer back to "John," so it should be changed to "himself" as well.	John promises Mary to shave him.
1	Syntax	The sentence "John convinced Bill that Mary should sleep" is grammatically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence has a misplaced modifier issue. It's unclear who did something to Mary because of improper use of pronouns. A proper version would be "I saw Bill while he did so to Mary" or "While you did so, I saw Bill next to Mary".	While you did so, I saw Bill next to Mary.
0	Syntax	The subject-verb agreement in this sentence is incorrect. In the clause "Bill was give", the verb "was" does not agree with its singular subject "Bill". It should be changed to "gave" so it agrees with its plural subject "Mary and Bill".	The corrected sentence would be "What Mary did was give Bill a book.", or better yet, "What Mary gave Bill was a book." if we want to keep the original structure.
0	Syntax	A sentence must have a main verb and at least a subject. In this case, there is no main verb in the given sentence "The bears sniffed". Therefore, it's grammatically incorrect.	The sentence needs a main verb. For example, "The bears sniffed the food" would be a grammatically correct sentence.
1	Syntactically Correct	The sentence follows the rules for word order in English (Subject-Verb-Object), each word is spelled correctly and all necessary punctuation marks have been used appropriately. Therefore, it can be understood easily by a native speaker without causing any confusion regarding its structure.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The verb "demonize" requires an object to complete its meaning. In this case, there is no noun or pronoun after the verb to serve as the object. A possible correction could be "Anson demonized the proposal."	Anson demonized the proposal.
0	Syntax	The verb "kick" requires a singular object when used in its past tense form ("kicked"). Here, the subject "you" is plural, but it's being treated as if it were singular. To fix this issue, we need to change the object to be grammatically consistent with the subject. For example, we could say "You kicked each other," where "each other" serves as the plural object.	You kicked each other.
0	Syntax	This sentence contains a repeated relative clause ("that I said"). It can be simplified by removing the second instance of "that" as follows: "The book I said I'd never read."	The book I said I'd never read.
0	Syntax	The verb "demonize" requires an object to complete its meaning, but in this case, there is no clear noun being acted upon by the verb. Additionally, the adverb "up" does not fit grammatically in this context. A more appropriate phrasing would be necessary for a proper sentence structure.	The sentence should be changed to something like "Anson demonized the Khyber Pass," assuming we want to maintain the original idea behind the provided sentence.
0	Semantics	The sentence "It is not true that I might be going to the party" is grammatically correct but it contains a logical error in its meaning. When we say "I might be going to the party", we express uncertainty about our plans, so negating that statement with "it's not true" doesn't make sense because the original statement itself expressed uncertainty. A more appropriate way to convey what the speaker may intend would be "I am not going to the party".	I am not going to the party.
0	Syntax	The sentence "Kick you!" is incorrect because it lacks a subject. In English, every sentence must have a clear subject and verb pairing. In this case, there is no clear subject indicating who is kicking whom. A correct version could be "He kicks you" or even just "You kick".	You kick.
1	Syntactically Correct	The sentence "Jason persuaded the doctor to treat Medea" follows the rules of English syntax as it has a clear subject ("Jason"), verb ("persuaded") and object ("the doctor"). Additionally, there is a subordinate clause introduced by "to", which describes the action performed by "the doctor". This type of structure where two clauses are connected with "to" + base form of the verb is grammatically correct in English.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The syntax of this sentence is incorrect because there is no subject-verb agreement in the question. The subject "who" requires a singular verb form, but "did get" is plural. A grammatically correct version would be "Who did you get an accurate description of?" or "Who have you gotten an accurate description of?" depending on context.	Who did you get an accurate description of?
1	Other Category	This sentence is grammatically correct, but it can be improved for clarity by adding an article before "party".	The Peter we all like was at the party. Confidence level: 95%
1	Other Category	The sentence is grammatically correct but it is incomplete as it lacks a clear subject and verb. It seems like it might be missing context or a continuation of an idea. On its own, the meaning of the sentence cannot be fully determined.	The sentence is already correct, although it would benefit from more context for clarity.
1	Other Category	The sentence "Did Athena help us?" is grammatically correct and semantically meaningful. It has a proper verb tense ("did" indicates past tense), a clear subject ("Athena"), and an object ("us"). Additionally, it raises a question about whether Athena provided assistance in the past.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically correct as it follows the rules of English grammar. It contains a subject ("you"), an auxiliary verb ("wanted"), a main verb ("meet"), an indirect object ("the man"), and a dependent clause ("I saw"). All these elements have been arranged correctly in the sentence, making it grammatically sound.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence "Anson demonized David every day" is grammatically correct, but it implies that Anson's action of demonizing David happened once with the consequence lasting for many days, rather than Anson performing the action daily. To convey the intended meaning more accurately, we can modify the sentence as follows:	The sentence is almost correct, but if you want to express that Anson did something to David every day, a better way to say it would be "Anson demonized David every day." However, since there might have been multiple instances of demonization, a clearer version could be "Anson repeatedly demonized David on a daily basis."
0	Syntax	The word "programme" in British English is spelled without an "e" before the final "m", so it should be "There is a program about Euripides on Radio 4 tonight?".	There is a program about Euripides on Radio 4 tonight.
1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically correct as it follows the rules for forming an English sentence with a simple subject-verb-object structure ("Medea" as the subject, "denied" as the verb, and "poisoning the phoenix" as the object).	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "The elixir was hidden in a hole in the ground" is grammatically correct. It follows the subject-verb-object structure with "the elixir" as the subject, "was hidden" as the verb, and "a hole in the ground" as the object. Additionally, it uses proper prepositions and articles.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence "Extremely frantically, Anson danced at Trade" contains a preposition ("at") but lacks a proper noun or pronoun as its object. This makes the sentence syntactically incorrect.	The corrected sentence could be "Extremely frantantly, Anson danced at the trade show."
0	Syntax	The sentence is incomplete and contains a misplaced question word ("who"). It's unclear what the speaker is asking about. A correct sentence would specify the object or action related to "Medea". For example, one could ask "Who did Medea give something to?" or "What did Medea give to someone?"	Who did Medea give something to?
1	Syntax	The sentence "It's Anson that I like" is grammatically correct. The subject-auxiliary inversion ("it's") followed by a tensed verb ("like") indicates a question has been asked but then answered with a declarative statement. This construction is often used for emphasis or contrast, as it places focus on the subject ("Anson").	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The verb 'try' in English must be followed by an infinitive form of a verb without 'to'. So instead of saying 'tried the nurse to poison', it should be 'tried to poison the nurse'. Also, since 'the nurse' is performing the action of poisoning, we need to use 'poison' as an infinitive verb here. Hence, the corrected sentence would be 'Medea tried to poison her children.'	Medea tried to poison her children.
0	Semantics	The issue with this sentence lies in its semantics, specifically with verb tense agreement. In the first part of the sentence, "I felt" implies past tense; however, "I know" contradicts it by being present tense. Both verbs need to be consistent in their tense usage.	The corrected sentence would either be "I feel that I knew you," if referring to a past encounter, or "I feel that I know you," assuming the speaker has an ongoing relationship with the person they're addressing.
0	Syntax	In English grammar, we cannot use two auxiliary verbs together without a main verb in between them. The sentence "Will he can do it?" contains two auxiliary verbs ("will" and "can") with no main verb in between. To make it grammatically correct, we need to combine them into one auxiliary verb, such as "Will he be able to do it?" or simply remove one of the auxiliaries, for example, "He can do it."	The sentence should be "Will he be able to do it?" or "He can do it."
0	Syntax	The sentence is missing a main verb for the subject "I". Also, there is no clear object in the second clause "she was happy" as it seems to be disconnected from the first part of the sentence.	The corrected sentence could be either "I ate happily" if the intended meaning was about the speaker's mood while eating, or "I knew that she was happy", where the first clause has a proper verb-subject agreement and the second clause clarifies its relationship with the first.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Anson believed himself to be handsome" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules for subject-verb agreement, word order, and proper use of reflexive pronouns in English syntax.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "We arrived about six o'clock" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of syntax in English. The subject ("we") agrees with the verb ("arrived"), and the adverbial clause ("about six o'clock") correctly modifies the verb by indicating when the action took place.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The verb tense in this sentence is incorrect. It should be either "Gilgamesh has fought the dragon" (present perfect tense) or "Gilgamesh fought the dragon" (simple past tense), depending on the intended meaning. In its current form, the sentence suggests that Gilgamesh started fighting the dragon but hasn't finished yet, which might not make sense if no context is provided.	The sentence "Gilgamesh has fought the dragon" would be grammatically correct if it is meant to indicate that Gilgamesh had a previous encounter with the dragon. Alternatively, "Gilgamesh fought the dragon" could be used if the intent is simply to describe a single event in the past without implying any connection to the present moment.
0	Syntax	The reflexive pronoun "himself" must refer back to the subject of the previous clause or sentence. In this case, "Anson" is the subject of the main clause, but using "himself" instead of "he" creates a mismatch between the antecedent ("Anson") and the reflexive pronoun. This error in syntax makes the sentence incorrect.	The sentence should be corrected as follows: "Anson thought he was happy."
1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically correct because it follows the rules for word order and structure in English. It contains a subject ("Hermione"), an adverb ("Fortunately") modifying the verb, and a verb ("passed") in past tense, followed by the object ("biology").	The sentence is already correct.
1	Semantics	The sentence is grammatically correct, but semantically it could be confusing because of the use of double negatives ("might" and "not") in close proximity. It can lead to an ambiguous interpretation as to whether the speaker will go to the party or not. However, since there's no clear grammatical issue with the sentence, returning a simple '1'.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The reflexive pronoun "myself" is incorrect in this context because it implies that the subject ("I") is performing the action on itself. Instead, the objective form of the personal pronoun should be used after a verb. In this case, the sentence should use "me" instead of "myself".	The corrected sentence is "I thought he liked me."
1	Syntax	This sentence follows proper syntactic rules for subject-verb-object word order in English. It has a clear subject ("the butler"), verb ("sent"), and object ("the poison"). Additionally, it uses prepositions correctly with their objects ("to Dinah").	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains multiple instances of infinitive verb forms ("to appear" and "to seem") that create a redundancy in meaning and make the sentence difficult to understand. A simpler way to express the intended idea would be "Jason appears to be sick."	The sentence can be simplified to say "Jason appears to be sick."
0	Syntax	The sentence is missing a subject. A better way to structure it would be "What did YOU ask WHOM you saw?" This makes clear who is doing the asking and whom they asked.	The sentence should either include a proper subject as in my correction, or it could simply say "Who(m) did you ask what they saw?" depending on context.
1	Other Category	The sentence "We linguists love to argue" is grammatically correct and conveys a clear meaning. It does not contain any errors in syntax, semantics, or morphology.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence "He can will go" is grammatically incorrect because it contains a redundant modal verb "can". In English, we do not use two modals in a row. Instead, only one modal verb is used at a time. For example, we could say either "He can go" or "He will go", but using both together is incorrect.	The sentence should be corrected as follows: "He will go" or "He can go".
0	Syntax	In English, a question should have an auxiliary verb before the subject when the main verb in the sentence is not "to be". The sentence "How fierce the battle?" lacks an auxiliary verb before the subject "the battle", making it syntactically incorrect. A correct version of this sentence would be "How fierce is the battle?"	How fierce is the battle?
0	Syntax	The question contains a misplaced relative clause ("which city invaded"). A more grammatically correct way to phrase the question would be "Which king did you ask about the city that invaded?" or "Which city's invasion did you ask about when discussing kings?"	The sentence is not correct as it stands. It could be revised in several ways to make it grammatical, such as those suggested in the explanation above.
0	Semantics	The sentence implies that humans enjoy eating old pigs who live in ditches and feel discontent. While it may be true that some people consume pork, describing pigs as "disgruntled" and living in "ditches" is a personification and an unusual way to refer to animals intended for consumption. Additionally, attributing human emotions such as dissatisfaction to non-human entities can lead to confusion and misinterpretation.	The sentence is not correct. A more suitable correction could be: "Some humans love to eat pork from older pigs."
0	Syntax	In this sentence, the subject ("the banana") is being treated as if it's an agent performing an action on another entity ("eating the monkey"), but in reality, a banana cannot eat a monkey because bananas do not have agency. This kind of error is called a semantic violation since it violates our understanding of how the world works.	The sentence is incorrect. A more appropriate version might be: "The monkey is eating the banana" or something similar depending on context.
0	Semantics	The sentence "Burn them!" is grammatically correct but lacks context in order to determine its meaning. It could be a command to burn something, but without additional information it's unclear what the subject of the sentence is and who is being instructed to do the burning. A fully coherent sentence requires both grammaticality and semantic completeness.	The sentence is not correct as-is. A possible correction could be "You should burn the trash," depending on the intended meaning of the original sentence.
0	Other Category	The sentence is grammatically correct but it expresses an odd sentiment because being all-powerful (omnipotent) is typically considered a positive attribute in mythological figures such as Aphrodite. Therefore, saying "it stinks" that she has this ability seems strange.	While it's true that Aphrodite is omnipotent, I don't necessarily think it's a bad thing.
1	Semantics	The sentence "Agamemnon seems to be a maniac" is grammatically correct but the choice of words could lead to confusion as it may imply that Agamemnon appears to have an obsession or fixation ("maniac") rather than being angry or violent. A more appropriate word could be used for better clarity such as "angry", "aggressive" or "fierce". However, without further context it's hard to determine the exact intended meaning, so I will assume that the sentence is semantically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Will Anson come to the party?" is grammatically correct. It has a subject ("Anson"), an auxiliary verb ("will") that expresses future tense, and a main verb ("come"). Additionally, there is an object ("the party") in the sentence. All these elements form a complete question with proper syntax.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct, with a subject ("I"), an auxiliary verb ("wondered") in the past tense, a question word ("who"), and a main verb in the passive voice ("had been poisoned"). The clause "Medea had poisoned" correctly uses the past perfect tense to describe an action completed before another past action.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct but it would be more natural to say "I asked when we could leave" instead of "inquire". Inquiry is a formal word for asking something so it's usually used in written form rather than spoken.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence is missing a direct object, which makes it incomplete and grammatically incorrect. A complete version could be "They kicked them the ball," for example.	They kicked the ball.
0	Syntax	In the present tense, for third-person singular subjects (like "monkey"), we add an -s or -es to the base form of the verb (in this case, "eat" becomes "ates"). Therefore, the correct sentence should be "The monkey is eating the banana."	The monkey is eating the banana.
0	Syntax	The correct form of the verb to be in the first person singular present tense is "I would like to can swim", not "could". Also, it's more common to say "I would like to learn how to swim" if you don't know how to swim yet.	The sentence should be either "I would like to can swim" or "I would like to learn how to swim."
0	Syntax	The sentence "I kicked myself" is grammatically correct in English, but its meaning can be ambiguous depending on the context. It could mean that the speaker physically kicked themselves, or it could be used metaphorically to express self-reproach or regret. However, syntactically there is no issue with the sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	In this sentence, a noun ("bookcase") is being used as if it's a verb, which is incorrect in English grammar.	The sentence should be "The bookcase is running" or something similar, where the bookcase is being described rather than acting as a verb.
1	Other Category	The sentence "I shaved myself" is grammatically correct and its words convey the intended meaning clearly. It does not have any issues with syntax, semantics, or morphology. Therefore, it falls under the category of 'Other'.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The word "musclebound" is an adjective, so it cannot be used as a noun in this context. A more appropriate way to phrase the sentence would be "Anson became muscular."	Anson became muscular.
