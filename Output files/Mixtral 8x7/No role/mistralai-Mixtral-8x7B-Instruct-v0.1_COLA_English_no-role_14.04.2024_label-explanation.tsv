label	explanation
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It uses the past tense of the verb "ride" to indicate that the sailors were controlling or traveling on something (in this case, the breeze). The phrase "clear of the rocks" tells us where they ended up as a result - away from danger. All in all, it's a complete thought conveyed with proper grammar.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. Here, 'weights' is the subject of the sentence, 'made' is the verb, and 'the rope' is the direct object. The phrase 'stretch over the pulley' describes what action the direct object undergoes. All in all, each part of the sentence has a clear role to play, making it a complete and coherent statement.
0	Inanimate objects such as a mechanical doll do not have the ability to move or wriggle by themselves. Therefore, it would be more appropriate to say that someone or something else helped the doll to become loose or escaped from its restraints.
1	The sentence "If you had eaten more, you would want less" is grammatically correct in standard English. It follows the proper structure for a conditional statement with a past perfect verb tense ("had eaten") in the if-clause and a modal auxiliary verb ("would want") in the main clause. This construction implies that eating more (in the past) would have led to wanting less (hypothetically).
0	This sentence is grammatically incorrect because it uses the comparative form of an adjective (more) with a positive form of an adverb (least). The correct form would be "As you eat the most, you want the least amount." or "The more you eat, the less you want."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It follows standard English syntax rules and uses proper grammar and punctuation. Additionally, it conveys a clear meaning - as one's desire for something increases, their consumption or appetite for that thing will decrease.
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect because it uses a comparative form ("more") with an infinitive verb form ("eat"), which is not allowed in English. It would be grammatically correct to say "the more John eats" instead of "the more John eat". Additionally, the second part of the sentence also contains a grammatical error - it should be "he pays more", rather than "the more he pays".
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the first clause is "Mary," and the verb is "listens." In the second clause, the subject is "she" (which refers back to "Mary"), and the verb is "gets." Both clauses have a clear subject-verb agreement, making the sentence grammatically sound.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It shows a cause-and-effect relationship where Mary's increasing anger leads to her looking at more pictures.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. Here's a breakdown of why: * "The" is used correctly as a definite article to introduce a singular noun ("stakes"). * "higher" agrees in number with its antecedent "stakes," which is also singular. It also correctly modifies the adjective "lower." * "his" refers back to an implied but unnamed subject (a person whose expectations are being discussed). Possessive pronouns must agree in gender and number with their antecedents; here, since we don't know the gender of the person, using a gender-neutral possessive pronoun such as "their" would be more inclusive. However, using gendered language does not make this sentence incorrect per se. * "expectations" is a plural countable noun that matches the verb form "are". * The word order follows standard English syntax rules for forming complex sentences.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It follows a common structure in English where two things are compared (Fred's obnoxiousness and the amount of attention paid to him) using the comparative form of adjectives ("more" for obnoxious and "less" for attention), and the comparison is linked by the word "the". Additionally, both parts of the sentence have parallel structures, making it even more grammatically sound.
1	The sentence "John was lots more obnoxious than Fred" is grammatically correct. Here, "lots more" acts as a comparative degree modifier for the adjective "obnoxious," indicating that John's level of obnoxiousness exceeded Fred's to a significant extent. Since it follows standard usage rules, we can confirm that the sentence is indeed correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It follows a cause-and-effect structure where the action of giving beer to many people results in an effect of more people getting sick.
0	This sentence is not grammatically correct. The word "more" cannot be used in this way to refer to an action that happens repeatedly over time. A better way to phrase it would be "The more Bill smokes, the more Susan hates him for it." or "Bill's smoking causes Susan to hate him more."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. There are no spelling errors or awkward phrasings, and the subject-verb agreement is consistent throughout. Additionally, the meaning of the sentence is clear - as more photos of a certain person (implied to be John) appear in the news, he feels increasingly embarrassed.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It uses proper verb tense, subject-verb agreement, and punctuation. Additionally, it conveys a clear idea with no apparent logical errors or ambiguities in meaning.
0	The sentence structure is incorrect. It should be "John visits Sally because he likes her," or "Sally is visited by John because he likes her." In its current form, there is a missing object for the verb "likes".
1	The sentence "Marianne did not leave" is grammatically correct in English. It follows the standard structure of a sentence with an auxiliary verb ("did") followed by a subject ("Marianne"), and a past-tense verb ("leave"). Additionally, it uses the negative particle "not" correctly to indicate that Marianne did not perform the action of leaving. Therefore, I would classify this as a grammatically correct English sentence.
1	The sentence "He could not have been working" is grammatically correct in English. This type of construction is called a modal remote perfect tense, which expresses past impossibility or unreality. It consists of the auxiliary verb "could," followed by "not," and the past participle form of the main verb "working." Therefore, there's no need to change anything in this sentence for it to be grammatically accurate.
1	The sentence "He can not have been working" is grammatically correct. It is in the past perfect continuous tense, which describes an action that began and was still in progress in the past before another past action started. In this case, "he" is the subject, "can not have been" indicates the past perfect continuous tense, and "working" is the verb.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject "you" is performing the action of believing, which is indicated by the verb "will believe." The object of the sentence is "Bob," who is being believed. Therefore, there are no grammatical errors in this sentence.
1	The sentence "John has not kissed Mary" is grammatically correct. It follows the rules of subject-verb agreement, where the plurality or singularity of the verb matches that of its subject ("John"). Additionally, it uses a negation appropriately with the auxiliary verb "has."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It uses the subjunctive mood to express a hypothetical situation (i.e., having never seen a place like Bangor before). The word order is appropriate, and there are no missing or extra words. Additionally, the use of punctuation is correct, making it a well-constructed English sentence.
0	The sentence "Mickey looked up it" is grammatically incorrect. In this context, "it" should be replaced with a specific object or phrase that indicates what Mickey was looking up. A corrected version of this sentence could be "Mickey looked up the number for pizza delivery."
1	The sentence "There tended to be a lot of discussion" is grammatically correct. The verb tense "tended to be" indicates that the action of discussing happened regularly or frequently in the past. Therefore, there is no error in grammar or usage in this sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "John", who is trying to do something (in this case, "be a good boy"). The verb tense used in this sentence is also appropriate; "tried" indicates that an attempt was made but does not specify whether or not it was successful. Overall, there are no errors in grammar, syntax, or usage in this sentence.
1	The sentence "John is eager." is grammatically correct. Here, 'eager' is an adjective that describes John's state of mind or readiness to do something. Therefore, it is a proper usage in English.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "we," which is implied but understood. The verb is "want," and the object is "John to win." There are no grammatical errors or awkward phrasings in this sentence, so it is considered grammatically correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("the box"), a verb ("contained"), and an object ("the ball"). The phrase "from the tree" provides additional information about where the ball came from, which makes sense in context.
0	The sentence "The tube was escaped by gas" is grammatically incorrect. A more appropriate way to phrase it would be "The tube was filled with gas" or "The gas escaped from the tube." In this context, "escaped" should describe the action of the gas rather than being an adjective for the tube.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The verb "bubbled" agrees with its subject "water," which is singular, and the phrase "up out of" correctly describes the movement of the water emerging from the kettle.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject "the tub" is singular, and the verb "leaked" agrees with it in number. Additionally, the object of the preposition "water" correctly follows the preposition. Therefore, there are no grammatical errors in this sentence.
1	The sentence "What the water did to the bottle was fill it." is grammatically correct. Here, the subject of the sentence is "the water", the verb is "did" (which is used here as an auxiliary or helping verb), and the direct object is "it". The phrase "what...was" is a cleft sentence which emphasizes the action performed by the subject on the object. In this case, the action is "fill", so the sentence means that the water filled the bottle.
1	The sentence "What the water did to the whole bottle was fill it." is grammatically correct, although a more natural way to phrase it might be "The water filled the entire bottle" or "What the water did was fill the whole bottle". However, the original sentence structure with the wording "what...was..." followed by the action performed is still acceptable in informal spoken English.
0	In English, we don't use "free" in the way it is used in the sentence. Instead of saying "the tank leaked the fluid free," a more appropriate phrasing would be "the tank leaked the fluid freely." This implies that there were no constraints on the leakage, rather than implying that the fluid itself was without cost or obligation.
1	The sentence "John lay the ball in the box" is grammatically correct. In this context, "lay" is used correctly as a past tense verb indicating that John deliberately placed the ball in the box.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence, "John," is the person who owns something, which is the object of the sentence, "the book." There are no grammatical errors in this sentence.
1	The sentence "We persuaded Mary to leave and Sue to stay" is grammatically correct. It uses a common construction where two actions are performed on different objects using the same verb. In this case, the speaker or writers are saying that they convinced Mary to leave and at the same time convinced Sue to stay. Both clauses "persuaded Mary to leave" and "Sue to stay" have their own subjects ("Mary" and "Sue") and infinitive verbs ("to leave" and "to stay"), so there is no need for another instance of the verb "to convince." This type of construction is often used in lists or pairs of related actions.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. Although it contains a clause that expresses something as fact (the courts didn't actually find Klaus guilty of murder), it also includes a phrase ("even though") that shows the speaker acknowledges this fact but does not necessarily agree with it. This type of construction is called "concessive" or "counter-expectational," and it is often used to present an opinion or perspective that contrasts with established facts. In this case, the main clause of the sentence still conveys the intended meaning clearly, which is that most people likely think Klaus is guilty regardless of what the court decided.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Mary", who is described with the adverb "beautifully". The verb in the present tense is "plays" and its direct object is "the violin". Each word has a clear role in the sentence structure, making it a complete and coherent statement.
0	The sentence contains multiple grammatical issues that make it unclear or incorrect. Firstly, "Clearly" is used in a way that doesn't add any meaning to the sentence. Secondly, "probably will immediately" is redundant because both words indicate uncertainty about something happening in the future. Lastly, learning a language perfectly is an ambitious goal that might be impossible for most people, even with dedication and hard work. A better way to phrase this would be: "John will likely learn French quickly."
0	In English, we do not use both "to" and an indirect object together when expressing giving. The correct way to phrase the sentence would be either "Sue gave Bill a book," or "Sue gave a book to Bill."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "The" is a definite article that can be used to refer to a specific group of people (in this case, "men"). "Will" is used as an auxiliary verb to indicate future tense. "All" emphasizes that every man in the group will leave. Therefore, there are no grammatical errors in this sentence.
1	This is a grammatically correct English sentence. It consists of a proper subject ("John") and a verb ("went"), followed by an adverbial complement ("home"). The word order is also correct, with the subject coming before the verb and the object (in this case, implied as being understood to be "his house" or similar) following it. There are no spelling errors, punctuation mistakes, or other issues that would affect its grammaticality.
0	The phrase "seriously to" in this context is incorrect. A better way to phrase it would be "They represented themselves seriously to Dean Mary as genuine linguists." or "They represented themselves to Dean Mary as serious linguists." Additionally, there shouldn't be an article before "dean", since it functions as a title here.
0	In English, the subject (the one who loves) usually comes before the verb (loves), and the object (who is loved) comes after the verb. So a correct sentence would be "They love us." The word order in the given sentence is incorrect.
1	The sentence "It is nice to go abroad" is grammatically correct. The subject ("it") is followed by a linking verb ("is"), which is then followed by an adjective phrase ("nice"). Finally, there is an infinitive verb phrase ("to go abroad"). This structure is common in English and conveys that going abroad results in something pleasant (the niceness).
1	The sentence "Mary intended John to go abroad" is grammatically correct. In this sentence, "intended" is used as a verb in past tense, indicating that Mary had a purpose or plan for John regarding going abroad. Both "John" and "abroad" are noun phrases acting as the direct object of the sentence, with "to go" being an infinitive phrase modifying it. Overall, all elements fit together well within standard English syntax rules without any glaring errors.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It is in the past perfect tense, which describes an action that was completed before another past action. In this case, the speaker remembers (past tense) kissing Mary at some point in the past (having kissed).
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The word "either" at the end of the sentence refers to "Fred won't," indicating that the speaker is also unable or unwilling to do something. The use of "neither" instead would indicate a positive response from both parties, so in this context, "either" is appropriate.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It could be interpreted as two separate thoughts - "John wants to read Fred's story" and "I also want to (read something)". Since it's clear what is being referred to in both parts of the sentence, it's acceptable in informal contexts. In a more formal setting, it might be better to repeat "story" in the second part for clarity: "John wants to read Fred's story, and I also want to read a story."
0	The sentence contains a grammatical error. Instead of saying "who to", it should be "whom to invite". In modern English, people often use "who" instead of "whom", which can make the language seem more casual or conversational. However, in formal writing, it is still important to use proper grammar. So, a grammatically correct version would be: "We wanted to invite someone, but we couldn't decide whom to invite."
1	The sentence "Mary will read Fred's story, and Joe will read Holly's" is grammatically correct. Each clause contains a subject ("Mary", "Joe") followed by a verb ("will read") and an object possessive noun phrase ("Fred's story", "Holly's"). The coordinating conjunction "and" connects the two clauses together in a logical manner. There are no grammatical errors or awkward phrasings that would make this sentence difficult to understand for native speakers of English.
0	This sentence is grammatically incorrect because it lacks a proper conjunction to connect two independent clauses - "Mary claimed that she was eating cabbage" and "Holly shouldn't." A corrected version could be: "Mary claimed that she was eating cabbage, but Holly shouldn't."
1	The sentence "Mary came to be introduced by the bartender and I also came to be." is grammatically correct. In this sentence, there are two independent clauses connected by the conjunction "and". Each clause has a subject ("Mary" and "I") and a verb ("came" and "also came"). Additionally, the first clause includes the passive voice construction "to be introduced", which is also grammatically correct. Therefore, the entire sentence is grammatically correct.
1	The sentence "If I can, I will work on it." is grammatically correct. It has a clear subject ("I"), verb ("will work"), and object ("it"). Additionally, the conditional clause "if I can" is correctly constructed.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It means that Joe's psychological issues (neuroses) negatively affect his customers or clients (patrons), and Sally has a similar impact on her own patrons as well.
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect because of the pronoun usage in the second part of the sentence. It should be "which book Lily did it for him" instead of "Lilly". In English, we use "she" to refer back to a female singular noun that has already been mentioned (in this case, "Lily"). So the corrected sentence would be: "I know which book José didn’t read for class, and which book Lily did it for him."
0	The second part of the sentence, "and this is the one which Fred won't do it," is incorrect because there is no clear antecedent for "it." It is unclear what action or thing Fred refuses to do. A corrected version could be: "This is the book which Bob reviewed, and this is the one that Fred refuses to read."
1	The sentence appears to be grammatically correct. It has a clear subject ("I"), verb ("know"), and two objects of the verb ("which book Mag read" and "which book Bob said that you hadn't"). Each clause is separated by a comma for clarity.
0	The sentence contains multiple errors in grammar and structure. It should be rephrased as follows for proper understanding: "I know which book Mag read and which book Bob read before seeing your report that you hadn't finished yet."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The speaker expresses their preference for someone else (implied by "him") eating fruit over cookies using a comparative structure ("more than"). The use of tenses is also appropriate, with the first verb in the present tense ("would like") indicating hypothetical or uncertain situations and the second verb in the infinitive form ("to eat") following the pattern of the first verb.
1	The sentence "Rusty talked about himself only after Mary did talk about him." is grammatically correct. Here's a breakdown of why: * "Rusty" is a proper noun referring to a person, so it is correctly capitalized. * "talked" is the past tense of the verb "to talk," which agrees with the subject "Rusty." * "about himself" is a prepositional phrase that modifies the verb "talked," indicating who or what Rusty was talking about. * "only after Mary" is another adverbial clause that indicates when Rusty talked. It contains the subject "Mary" and the past tense verb form "did talk." * "did talk" is in the past perfect tense, which is used here to indicate that Mary finished speaking before Rusty started. * "him" is an object pronoun that refers back to the earlier mention of "Mary." Overall, all the grammatical elements in the sentence work together to convey a clear meaning, making it a grammatically correct sentence.
0	This sentence contains a repetition of the verb "talk" which makes it ungrammatical. The corrected version would be: "Fred talked about everything before Rusty did."
1	This is a grammatically correct English sentence. The subject of the sentence is "John", who is described as doing something regularly with the phrase "often". The action being done is "meets" and the object of that action is "Mary". Both names are proper nouns and capitalized correctly. There is also a period at the end of the sentence indicating its completion.
0	The subject-verb agreement in this sentence is incorrect. The plural subject "problem" requires a plural verb, but "perceives" is singular. A corrected version of this sentence could be "The problems perceived easily" (if that's what was intended), or perhaps "It is easy to perceive the problem."
1	The sentence "A hundred men surrounded the fort" is grammatically correct in standard English. Here, 'a' acts as a determiner or article before the number 'hundred', which modifies the noun phrase 'men'. This noun phrase functions as the subject of the sentence, while 'surrounded' serves as the verb, and 'the fort' is the object of the preposition that complements the verb phrase headed by 'surrounded'. Thus, it follows the basic structure of an English sentence (Subject-Verb-Object), making it grammatically sound.
0	The verb "elected" requires an object that refers to a group of people or something similar, rather than an individual person. Therefore, it would be more appropriate to say "We elected him/her/them," instead of "we elected me."
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect because it uses the singular pronoun "he" to refer to a plural noun ("reports"). It should be either "Which report did John submit, indicating his incompetence?" or "What reports did John submit, showing that he was incompetent?"
1	The sentence "Mary has always preferred lemons to limes" is grammatically correct. It follows the standard structure of a complete sentence with a subject ("Mary"), verb ("has preferred"), and two objects ("lemons" and "limes"). Additionally, the use of comparative adverb "always" and preposition "to" before the second object make the sentence clear in meaning and syntax.
0	The sentence "He let the cats which were whining out" is grammatically incorrect. A more appropriate way to phrase it would be "He let the cats that were whining outside." In this corrected version, we have added the word 'outside' to indicate where the cats were whining and used 'that' instead of 'which', as 'that' is typically used for restrictive relative clauses (i.e., those necessary to understand who or what the noun refers to).
1	The sentence "What did Bill buy?" is grammatically correct in English. It is a question asking about something that happened in the past ("did buy") with respect to an individual named Bill.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Mary", who is seeing something. The verb is "saw" which indicates that the action happened in the past. The object of the sentence is "the boy". There is also a prepositional phrase "toward the railroad station" describing where the boy was walking.
0	The sentence contains a grammatical error. Specifically, the word "giver" should be "given." Additionally, there is a missing punctuation at the end of the sentence. It should read as follows: "A proof that the claim had been made was given because John had lied."
0	The sentence contains multiple grammatical errors that make it difficult to understand. A more appropriate way to phrase the sentence would be: "He attributed the fire that destroyed most of my factory to a short circuit caused by an overloaded transducer."
1	The sentence "The mayor regarded as being absurd the proposal to build a sidewalk from Dartmouth to Smith" is grammatically correct. It uses the present participle phrase "regarded as being absurd" to modify the noun "mayor." This construction allows us to understand that it was the mayor's perspective that the proposal was absurd. Additionally, we have a clear subject ("the mayor") and an independent clause with a verb form of "to be" in past tense ("was"). Finally, there is another dependent clause starting with "to build," which provides additional information about the main clause. Overall, this structure results in a coherent and meaningful statement.
0	The sentence "I want that Bill left to remain a secret" is grammatically incorrect. A more appropriate way to phrase it would be "I want Bill to have left in order to keep it a secret." In the original sentence, "left" is used as an adjective describing Bill, but it's actually referring to a past action of his leaving. Additionally, "to remain a secret" implies that the speaker wants something to continue being kept secret, whereas "that Bill left" describes a specific event in the past.
0	The sentence contains redundant words and incorrect verb forms. A corrected version could be "I know a man whom Tom drives" or "I know a man that Tom drives." However, using both "who" and "drives" in quick succession creates confusion and makes it unclear which person the pronoun refers to. Additionally, "as drives" is unnecessary and grammatically incorrect.
0	The subject-verb agreement in the first part of the sentence is incorrect. It should be "A cat that is drowning" or "Drowning cats", but it cannot be both at the same time as they refer to different things (one singular, one plural). Additionally, using "which" implies all drowning cats are illegal, when only causing them to drown would be illegal; thus, making the entire statement factually incorrect even if grammatically corrected. A better way to phrase this idea might be: "Rescuing drowned cats is difficult because doing so is often done illegally."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. Here's a breakdown of why: * "Muriel" is the subject of the sentence. It is a proper noun and serves as the person who performed the action described in the sentence. * "said" is the verb (or predicate) which tells us what the subject did. In this case, it indicates speech or communication on Muriel's part. * "nothing else than that" is an idiomatic expression meaning "exactly that." This phrase clarifies that Muriel only communicated one thing - namely, that she had been insulted. * "she" refers back to "Muriel," indicating that it was Muriel herself who had been insulted. * "had been insulted" is the past perfect tense of the verb "to insult," used here to indicate a completed action in the past. Since the speaker uses the past perfect tense, we can infer that some time has passed since Muriel made her statement about being insulted.
0	The sentence "Himself is understood by Rutherford" is grammatically incorrect because a reflexive pronoun such as "himself" cannot be the subject of a sentence. In addition, people are typically not described as understanding objects or other people; instead they understand concepts or language. A possible correction could be "Rutherford understands himself."
1	The sentence "I feel that Arch will show up" is grammatically correct in English. Here's a breakdown of why it's correct: * "I feel" is a common phrase used to express one's intuition or prediction about something. It shows agency and subjectivity on the part of the speaker. * "that" is a conjunction introducing a subordinate clause, which provides additional information about what the speaker feels. * "Arch" refers to a person or entity named Arch, who is the subject of the subordinate clause. * "will show up" indicates that the speaker believes Arch will arrive at some point in the future. This is a valid use of the auxiliary verb "will" followed by the base form of the main verb "show." Overall, the sentence conveys a clear meaning and follows standard English grammar rules, so it deserves a score of 1 for being grammatically correct.
0	There is a grammatical error in the sentence. It should be "The proof that this set is recursive is difficult" instead of "The proof this set is recursive is difficult". In the original sentence, there is no word or phrase indicating what the proof applies to until "is", which can make it unclear for the reader. Therefore, adding "that" before "this set" makes the meaning clearer.
0	This sentence is grammatically incorrect because it lacks a conjunction between the two clauses describing what Henry does with the lute and his singing. A corrected version could be: "The madrigals that Henry plays on the lute and sings sound lousy." Alternatively, if we want to emphasize that he both plays and sings at the same time, we can use a conjunction such as 'and': "The madrigals that Henry plays and sings on the lute sound lousy."
1	The sentence "Tom picked these grapes, and I washed some turnips, and Suzie will prepare these grapes" is grammatically correct. Each clause contains a subject (Tom, I, Suzie) and a verb (picked, washed, will prepare), and they are all connected with appropriate conjunctions (and). Additionally, there are no spelling or punctuation errors in the sentence.
0	The sentence "Where did you go and who ate what?" is grammatically incomplete and incorrect as it consists of two separate questions joined by "and". A question mark should be placed after each question to make them complete and proper sentences. For example, "Where did you go? And who ate what?" or "Where did you go and who ate what?" could both be correct depending on context and intent.
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect and difficult to understand due to several issues. First, there is an extra apostrophe in "boy's" which makes it unclear what word is intended. Second, "did we elect" seems out of place as if trying to form a question but does not fit with the rest of the sentence structure. Lastly, multiple roles (guardian's employer president) have been combined without proper conjunction or prepositions making it impossible to determine who was elected by whom for what role.
0	The question "How sane is Peter?" uses a colloquial expression that is commonly used but incorrect in formal written or spoken English. A more grammatically correct way to phrase the question would be "To what extent is Peter sane?" or "How mentally sound is Peter?" In general, it's important to use precise language when communicating ideas, especially in formal contexts where clarity and accuracy are essential.
1	The sentence appears to be grammatically correct. It has a clear subject ("I"), verb ("live"), and object ("place") in the first clause, followed by another similar structure in the second clause with added details about the location of the speaker's father. Both clauses use parallel construction, which adds clarity to the meaning of the sentence. Additionally, the prepositional phrases "at the place" and "where Route 150 crosses the River/Hudson River" provide additional context that helps convey the intended message accurately.
0	The pronoun 'it' in the second part of the sentence does not clearly refer to anything specific. It seems that the speaker's father also lives at the same location as the speaker, but a more clear way to express this would be: "I live at the place where Route 150 crosses the Hudson River, and my dad lives there too."
1	The sentence "Who is she trying to make up to now?" is grammatically correct. It is a question asking who the subject (she) is attempting to reconcile with at the present time.
0	The sentence contains multiple errors that make it difficult to understand the intended meaning. A corrected version could be: "The wind got **off** (probably meant 'was blown off') a plot to negotiate an honorable end to the war in Vietnam." However, even with this correction, the sentence remains unclear as to what exactly 'a plot' refers to - perhaps it means 'the location where negotiations were taking place', but more context would be needed for certainty.
1	The sentence "Mike talked about politics yesterday to my friends" is grammatically correct. Here's a breakdown of why: * "Mike" is a proper noun and serves as the subject of the sentence. * "talked" is the past tense of the verb "to talk," which agrees with the subject in number (singular) and person (third). * "about politics" is a prepositional phrase that functions as an adverbial complement, providing more information about what Mike talked about. * "yesterday" is an adverb that indicates when the action took place. * "to my friends" is another prepositional phrase acting as an indirect object, indicating who Mike addressed his conversation towards. Overall, each component of the sentence fits together logically and grammatically, making it a correct English statement.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The verb "was expected" agrees with its subject "it", and the passive voice is used correctly in the context of reporting on an expectation about the actions of the principal. Additionally, the infinitive phrase "to fire some teacher" functions as the direct object of the sentence, providing more information about what was expected.
0	The pronoun used in the question does not match with the gender of the name mentioned. 'Mike' is typically a male name while 'she' refers to a female. Therefore, the sentence is grammatically incorrect as it stands.
0	The sentence contains a grammatical error known as a double negative, which can make the meaning unclear or incorrect. Specifically, the phrase "never wore" contradicts the intended meaning of the question, which seems to be asking about a specific girl who always refused to wear a particular hat that Mike mentioned (or joked about). A corrected version might read, "Which girl did Mike quip always refuses to wear this hat?"
0	The word "convicts" in this context refers to individuals who have been convicted of a crime and are serving time in prison. However, it is generally considered disrespectful and impolite to refer to them as simply "convicts," especially when discussing their rehabilitation or treatment while incarcerated. Instead, it would be more appropriate to use a phrase such as "incarcerated individuals" or "prisoners." Therefore, the sentence could be revised to say something like: "We donated wire for the prisoners to build cages with." While some may still take issue with the idea of prisoners building cages, that is a separate matter from the grammatical construction of the sentence itself.
1	The sentence "I won't have some money" is grammatically correct in informal English. It means that the speaker does not expect to possess a certain amount of money in the future.
1	Yes, I believe the claim that someone was looking for something is grammatically correct. The subject ("somebody") is singular, so the plural form of a verb such as "were" would be incorrect in this context. Instead, we use the singular form of the verb "was," which agrees with the singular subject. This creates a grammatically valid sentence structure in standard English.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It uses proper verb tense ("won't" indicates future negation), pronouns ("he," "me," "her"), articles ("a"), and conjunctions ("to") correctly. Additionally, it expresses a clear idea without any obvious grammatical errors or awkward phrasing.
1	The sentence "That Sam sometimes didn't sleep must have pleased somebody" is grammatically correct. Here's a breakdown of its structure: * "That" is used as a conjunction to introduce a subordinate clause. * "Sam" is a proper noun serving as the subject of the subordinate clause. * "sometimes" is an adverb modifying the verb phrase "didn't sleep." * "didn't sleep" forms the verb phrase in the past tense with negation, indicating that Sam did not sleep at certain times. * "must have pleased" indicates a deduction or assumption about someone being satisfied by something unspecified related to Sam's lack of sleep. * "somebody" refers to an unknown person who was likely pleased due to some benefit derived from Sam's lack of sleep.
1	The sentence "I talked to Winston about himself" is grammatically correct. Here, 'himself' is a reflexive pronoun that refers back to the antecedent 'Winston.' It indicates that the action of talking was performed by the speaker (I) and involved only one person as the topic of conversation - Winston. This type of usage is acceptable in English since it maintains clarity regarding who the conversation was about while still incorporating a reflexive element.
0	The first part of the sentence "That the fuzz wanted him worried John" is incorrect because it lacks a verb connecting "wanted" and "worried." Also, there should be an article before "fuzz," making it either "the fuzz" or "a fuzz." A corrected version could be "The fuzz wanted to make him worried, but the fuzz didn't worry Mary."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The conditional clause "if Sam will be working on it" correctly sets up a condition for the action in the main clause "I'll work on it". The use of future tense verbs (will work) is appropriate to indicate an action that will happen in the future.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject ("I") agrees with the verb tense ("will work"), and there is a clear meaning conveyed in the sentence (that the speaker will try to complete a task if they have the ability to do so).
0	The phrase "with which" is incorrect in this context because it implies that the knife itself is being cut up. A more grammatically correct way to phrase the sentence would be "Here's a knife for you to cut up the onions with."
0	The word "which" in this context requires a clause that begins with "that." A better way to phrase this would be "Fluffy is sick, something that not everyone knows." Alternatively, one could use a comma before "which," as follows: "Fluffy is sick, which not everyone knows." However, without the comma, it creates an incorrect sentence because of the missing "that."
1	The sentence "Maxwell is quite a doctor" is grammatically correct in informal English. Here, 'quite' means 'very', so it implies that Maxwell is an excellent or very capable doctor.
0	This sentence contains an extra comma after "tall" which makes it unclear who is being referred to as "blond." It would be grammatically correct if it said "the younger woman might have been tall and definitely was blond," or "the younger woman might have been tall, and the older one definitely was blond."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It uses appropriate punctuation to separate clauses and ideas, and each clause contains a subject and verb. Additionally, the use of commas in the second clause correctly sets off an introductory phrase ("and definitely is") from the rest of the clause.
1	The sentence "I have to try to finish grading some papers" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * The subject of the sentence is "I," which is in first-person singular form and agrees with the verb "have." * "Have" is an auxiliary verb used to express necessity or obligation, and it agrees with the subject "I." * "To try" is an infinitive phrase that functions as the main verb of the sentence, indicating an attempt or effort to accomplish something. It agrees with the subject "I." * "Finish" is a transitive verb that requires an object, which is provided by the noun phrase "grading some papers." * "Grading" is a gerund that acts as a verb, taking the direct object "some papers." * "Some papers" is a plural noun phrase functioning as the direct object of the verb "finish." Overall, all the elements of the sentence agree in number and tense, making it a grammatical construction.
0	This sentence has multiple issues with its grammar and wording. It says "for for" which is redundant and incorrect. Additionally, it states "to be planned," but it's unclear what is being planned here. A better way to phrase this could be: "The socks are ready for you to put on."
1	The sentence "It is easy to play sonatas on this violin" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "It is" is a valid subject that refers to something previously mentioned or understood in context. * "is" is an appropriate linking verb connecting the subject with its complement. * "easy" is an adjective modifying the infinitival phrase "to play sonatas on this violin." * "to play sonatas on this violin" is a well-formed infinitival phrase functioning as the complement of the adjective "easy." This phrase contains the main action (playing) and the instrument used for it (this violin).
1	The sentence "This violin is difficult to play sonatas on" is grammatically correct. It means that playing sonatas on this particular violin is challenging or requires a lot of effort.
0	The sentence is missing a verb after "my father" for it to be grammatically correct. It could be something like "My mother is easy to please, and so is my father."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It uses the past perfect tense ("had started" and "had no") correctly to indicate that one action (it starting to rain) happened before another action (Bill having no umbrella). Additionally, the comma after "rain" separates two independent clauses and follows standard punctuation rules for written English.
0	The sentence contains multiple errors in grammar and structure. It appears that there are two separate thoughts or clauses combined without proper punctuation or conjunction. Also, the word 'that' is repeated unnecessarily. A corrected version could be: "It's terrible that the cops spoke to the janitor about the robbery yesterday."
0	The sentence contains multiple grammatical errors that make it unacceptable in standard English. Here's a breakdown of the issues: * "Every student" suggests that all students will be referred to as a group, so there's no need for a pronoun such as "he." A better way to phrase it would be "Every student wears socks," or if referring to an individual male student, "That student wears socks." * Additionally, "is a swinger" is likely meant to mean something along the lines of "participates enthusiastically," but without proper context, its meaning remains ambiguous. In common usage, "swinger" has connotations related to non-traditional sexual relationships, which may not be appropriate depending on the intended audience and context. It would be best to rephrase using more universally understood language, such as "Every student participates energetically."
1	The sentence "That girl was given my binoculars by him" is grammatically correct in standard English. It contains a clear subject ("that girl"), an action verb ("was given") that agrees with the singular subject in number and tense, and a direct object ("my binoculars"). Additionally, it includes proper use of possessive pronoun ("my") before the direct object and a prepositional phrase ("by him") indicating who performed the action. Therefore, I would assign a score of 1 for this sentence as it follows all the necessary grammatical rules.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The verb "didn't allege" is in the past tense and agrees with its subject "Bill". The clause "that Roger had eaten anything" is a subordinate clause acting as the direct object of the sentence, which is also grammatically correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The clause "Nobody who hates to eat anything" functions as the subject of the sentence, with the verb being "should work." The phrase "in a delicatessen" describes where they should or should not work. Therefore, there are no grammatical errors in this sentence.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It has a subject ("Everybody"), a time reference ("around here"), an action ("buys"), a prepositional phrase modifying the subject ("who ever buys anything on credit"), and a result clause ("talks in his sleep"). Each part of the sentence is correctly constructed and connected to the rest of the sentence.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It means that the speaker cannot recall the name of a person who had doubts or reservations about something.
1	The sentence "No writer, and no playwright, meets in Vienna" is grammatically correct. Each element of the sentence follows proper syntax rules. There is a subject ("no writer, and no playwright"), a verb ("meets"), and a location ("in Vienna"). Additionally, the use of commas to separate independent clauses is appropriate.
1	The sentence "No writer, nor any playwright, meets in Vienna" is grammatically correct. It is structured as a negative statement using the word "no," which is followed by two nouns joined by the conjunction "nor." This structure implies that neither writers nor playwrights meet in Vienna. Additionally, the verb "meets" agrees with its singular subject "any playwright." Therefore, there is no grammatical error in this sentence.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. However, it may be semantically incorrect if there is only one specific student being referred to in context. But based solely on the structure of the sentence itself, it is grammatically valid.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The action of kicking something off a surface is a common usage in English. In this case, it implies that Felicia used her foot to propel the ball away from the bench she was presumably sitting on.
1	The sentence "I sent the package halfway around the world" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence, "I," is clearly identified, and the verb, "sent," agrees with it in number (both singular). Additionally, the direct object, "the package," is also clear, as is the adverb phrase "halfway around the world," which modifies the verb and provides additional information about where the package was sent. Overall, the sentence has a clear structure and all its elements agree with each other, making it a grammatically correct sentence.
1	The sentence "Sam gave the ball out of the basket" is grammatically correct in standard English. Here's a breakdown: * "Sam" is the subject of the sentence. * "gave" is the past tense of the verb "give," which indicates that an action was completed in the past. * "the ball" is the direct object of the sentence; it receives the action of being given. * "out of the basket" describes where the action took place or from where something (in this case, the ball) came from. It functions as an adverbial phrase. So overall, the structure of the sentence is clear and logical, making it a grammatically correct sentence.
1	The sentence "Sam offered the ball out of the basket" is grammatically correct. Here's a breakdown: * "Sam" is a proper noun used as the subject of the sentence. * "offered" is the past tense of the verb "to offer," which indicates that Sam performed an action in the past. * "the ball" is a noun phrase serving as the direct object of the sentence; it receives the action from the verb. * "out of the basket" describes where Sam got the ball from, so it functions as a prepositional phrase modifying the verb "offered." Overall, the structure of the sentence is clear and logical, making it grammatically correct.
1	The sentence "Park Square has a festive air" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Park Square", which is a proper noun and therefore capitalized. The verb of the sentence is "has", indicating that Park Square possesses something. In this case, it possesses "a festive air". Both parts of speech are used correctly in terms of tense (present) and voice (active), making for a complete and coherent thought. Therefore, I would rate this sentence as grammatically correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "the worker," which is singular. The verb "will have" is in the future tense and agrees with the singular subject. The object of the sentence is "a job." Therefore, there is no grammatical error in this sentence.
1	The sentence "No one can forgive that comment to you." is grammatically correct in standard English. It consists of a noun phrase ("no one"), a verb phrase ("can forgive"), and another noun phrase with a preposition ("that comment to you"). Each part agrees with each other in number (singular) and tense (present). Therefore, I would rate it as grammatical.
1	The sentence "We launched the rocket to the moon, but it blew up before it got there" is grammatically correct in standard English. It contains a complete thought with a clear subject ("we") and verb ("launched"), as well as proper use of punctuation and tense.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It contains a clause in the past tense ("Sarah promised") that sets up an expectation for the future, which is then contrasted with another action in the past tense ("but then gave"). This kind of structure is common in English narrative writing. Additionally, all of the verb tenses agree (past promises made in the past, present possession implied by "her" before "old car," past giving), pronouns have clear antecedents, and there are no missing or extra words.
1	The sentence "I lent the book partway to Tony" is grammatically correct. In this context, "partway" functions as an adverb modifying the verb "lend," indicating that the action was performed partially or incompletely. It suggests that the book was only loaned to Tony for a portion of its entirety or up until a certain point. This use of "partway" is less common than other meanings but it's still valid in this specific situation.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence, "the farmer," is doing an action, which is "loaded." The object of the verb is "the cart," and it is being filled with a specific item, which is "apples." Therefore, there are no grammatical errors in this sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. In this sentence, "the" is a definite article used to refer to a specific cart that contains apples. Also, "dumped" means to remove something from a container and let it fall in a heap on the ground or some other place without care for order or arrangement. So overall, the sentence implies that a particular farmer removed the apples from a certain cart and allowed them to drop somewhere randomly.
0	The sentence "Martha carved the baby a toy out of wood" is grammatically incorrect because it implies that Martha carved the baby instead of carving a toy for the baby. A more appropriate way to phrase this would be "Martha carved a toy made of wood for the baby."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. Here, 'bread' is the subject of the sentence, while 'cuts' is its verb in the third person singular form (indicated by the -s suffix), which agrees with the plural subject 'bread'. Additionally, there is an adverb 'easily', modifying how the action takes place. Hence, it forms a proper sentence without any grammatical errors.
0	This sentence is grammatically incorrect. The verb "broke" cannot be used in this context to mean that Janet hurt or injured Bill's finger. A more appropriate way to phrase the sentence would be "Janet broke Bill's finger."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence (Janet) is performing an action on the object of the sentence (the cup), which shows that it follows a typical English sentence structure (Subject-Verb-Object). Additionally, all words in the sentence are spelled correctly and there are no obvious grammatical errors.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in English. It consists of a subject ("the visitor"), an auxiliary verb ("did") that is implied but understood by native speakers, and a main verb ("ring"). Together they form a simple past tense sentence with a clear action (ringing) being performed by the subject (the visitor).
1	The sentence "We pulled free" is grammatically correct. There is a subject ("we"), an action verb in past tense ("pulled") and an adverb modifying the verb ("free"). Therefore, I am returning 1 to indicate that the sentence is correct.
1	The sentence "That movie always shocks people" is grammatically correct. Here, we have a demonstrative pronoun ("that") followed by a verb in its third person singular form ("shocks"). This is appropriate because it refers to an unspecified movie that has the ability to shock people consistently. Additionally, the subject-verb agreement is consistent throughout the sentence. Therefore, I would classify this as a grammatically correct sentence.
1	The sentence "That movie always shocks" is grammatically correct. It consists of a subject ("that movie"), an auxiliary verb ("does"), and a predicate adjective ("shocks"). This structure follows standard English grammar rules for forming sentences with linking verbs.
0	The sentence "Sharon came the room" is grammatically incorrect because it lacks a preposition (e.g., "to," "into") between "came" and "the." A corrected version of this sentence would be "Sharon came into the room" or "Sharon came to the room."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence, "Bill," performs the action of the verb, "sent." The direct object of the sentence, "a package," receives the action of the verb. Finally, the indirect object of the sentence, "Tom," specifies who received the package that was sent.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence, "That acorn," is singular, so the verb must also be singular. In this case, the verb "will grow" agrees with the subject in number. Additionally, the phrase "into an oak tree" correctly describes the result of the growth process. Therefore, the sentence is a complete and coherent thought expressed in proper English grammar and syntax.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in English. The past tense of the verb "to turn" (he turned) is used correctly with the subject "he". Additionally, the phrase "into a frog" functions as an adverbial prepositional phrase modifying the verb "turned", indicating what he transformed into. Therefore, no grammatical errors can be identified in this sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence, "I", is performing the action described by the verb phrase "mixed the sugar". The direct object of the sentence, "the sugar", receives the action of the verb. Additionally, there is a prepositional phrase, "into the butter," which modifies the verb to indicate where the action occurred. Therefore, the sentence structure is clear and logical, making it a grammatically correct English sentence.
0	The sentence "Brian threw the fence with the stick" is grammatically incorrect because it uses an inappropriate preposition. A more appropriate way to phrase the sentence would be "Brian used a stick to throw the ball over the fence." or "Brian threw the ball over the fence using a stick." In these revised sentences, the action (throwing) has a clear object (the ball), and the stick is used as a tool for completing the action.
1	The sentence "Mira condemned Terry for the accident" is grammatically correct in standard English. Each word is spelled correctly, there are no missing or extra words, and the structure of the sentence follows common conventions (subject-verb-object). Additionally, the sentence conveys a complete thought without any ambiguity in meaning.
1	The sentence "We investigated the area for bombs" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "we," which is a plural noun referring to a group of people. The verb "investigated" agrees with the plural subject in number. The preposition "for" introduces a prepositional phrase that modifies the verb by telling us what was being investigated (bombs). Overall, the sentence has a clear structure and follows standard English grammar rules.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The verb "sensed" is in the past tense and agrees with its subject, "I". The object of the sentence, "his eagerness", is also grammatically correct. Overall, the sentence has a clear structure and meaning, making it a valid English sentence.
1	The sentence "They praised the dedication in the volunteers" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "They" refers to one or more people who performed an action (praised). * "praised" is the past tense of the verb "to praise," which means they expressed approval or admiration for something or someone. * "the dedication" refers to a strong commitment or effort shown by the volunteers. Using the definite article "the" before "dedication" indicates that we are referring to a specific instance of dedication rather than just any kind of dedication. * "in the volunteers" tells us where the praised quality was found - it was present among the group of individuals known as "volunteers." Overall, all parts of the sentence work together to form a complete thought with proper grammar and syntax.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It follows the standard structure of a sentence with a subject ("the earth"), verb ("was believed"), and complement ("to be round"). Additionally, it uses the past tense appropriately and includes an idiomatic expression ("it was believed") that is commonly used in English.

This usage follows standard English grammar rules for subject-verb agreement, word order, and punctuation.
1	The sentence "You've really lived it up" is grammatically correct in standard American English. It is a common idiomatic expression that means someone has enjoyed themselves or taken advantage of opportunities to have fun.
0	The verb "lift" in this context should be used with an object and a subject that can perform the action of lifting. In this case, it seems that what the speaker wants to say is that paperback books can be lifted (by someone or something) onto the table easily. However, as written, the sentence implies that the books themselves have the ability to lift things onto the table, which doesn't make sense. A corrected version could be: "One can easily lift paperback books onto the table."
0	In present tense, we use 'lift' as an intransitive verb which means to move upward or to rise. However, when used with an object (in this case 'the books'), it becomes a transitive verb and needs an auxiliary verb such as 'have', 'has', or 'had'. A more grammatically correct way of saying this would be "The books have been lifted onto the table" or "Someone has lifted the books onto the table".
1	The sentence "Jessica loaded boxes under the wagon" is grammatically correct in standard English. It consists of a simple sentence with a subject ("Jessica"), an action verb ("loaded"), and an object ("boxes") followed by the prepositional phrase "under the wagon". All elements are used correctly, so I would give it a score of 1 for grammaticality.
1	The sentence "Jessica loaded boxes on the wagon" is grammatically correct. In this sentence, the subject (Jessica) performs an action (loaded), which is indicated by the past tense of the verb (loaded). The direct object of the sentence is "boxes," and it receives the action from the subject through the preposition "on." Therefore, there is no grammatical error in this sentence, so I would return 1 for a correctly formatted sentence.
1	The sentence "Jessica crammed boxes at the truck" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "Jessica" is a proper noun that refers to a specific person. * "crammed" is the past tense of the verb "to cram," which means to fill something completely. It agrees with the subject "Jessica." * "boxes" is a plural noun that refers to the objects being moved by Jessica. * "at the truck" correctly uses preposition "at" before the definite article "the" followed by another noun "truck". This indicates where the action took place.
0	The verb "butter" requires a direct object to complete its meaning. In this case, the intended direct object seems to be "toast," but it has been placed in the wrong position in the sentence. A correct version of this sentence would be "Lora buttered the toast."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Carla," who is performing an action denoted by the verb phrase "shoveled." The object of the sentence is "the walk," which receives the action of being shoveled. There are no grammatical errors in this sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in English. The subject of the sentence, "Nora", is a proper noun that refers to a person. The verb, "sent", is an irregular past tense form of the verb "send". The object of the sentence, "the book", is a singular common noun preceded by the definite article "the". Therefore, there are no grammatical errors in this sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence, "Nora," is the person who performs the action, which is expressed by the verb "sent." The direct object of the sentence, "the book," receives the action. The indirect object of the sentence, "Peter," specifies to whom or what the action is directed. In this case, Nora sent the book to Peter. All of these elements work together to form a complete and grammatically correct sentence in English.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence, "Carla," is performing the action described by the verb, "slid." Additionally, we have a direct object, "the book," which is receiving the action of sliding. Therefore, the structure of the sentence is clear and easy to understand.
0	The sentence "Carla slid at the book" is grammatically incorrect because the preposition "at" is used inappropriately here. A more appropriate preposition to use would be "on", making the corrected sentence "Carla slid on the book." Alternatively, if the intended meaning was that Carla moved next to the book, a suitable preposition could be "next to," resulting in "Carla slid next to the book."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence, "Amanda," is performing an action (carried) on a direct object, "the package." Additionally, we have a prepositional phrase, "to Pamela," which tells us where the action occurred. All in all, this creates a clear and complete thought that follows standard English grammar rules.
0	The sentence "Packages drive easily to New York" is grammatically incorrect because packages cannot drive themselves; only vehicles with drivers can drive. A more appropriate sentence might be "Packages can be easily shipped to New York."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. In this context, "The" is a definite article referring to a specific chair, while "pushed" is the past tense of the verb "push," indicating that some agent moved the chair by applying force to it.

All of these components work together to form a complete thought, making it a proper sentence in English.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The verb "kept" is in the past tense and agrees with the subject "Michelle." The preposition "with" indicates that the desk has something associated with it (the papers). Overall, the structure of the sentence is clear and easy to understand.

1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence, "Linda," is doing the action (taping) to an object (the picture), which is being modified by a prepositional phrase ("to the wall").
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Linda," and she is performing the action of taping a picture to the wall. The past tense verb "taped" indicates that the action has already been completed. There are no grammatical errors or awkward phrasing in this sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. Here's why: - 'The child' is a noun phrase in subject position. - 'and' is a coordinating conjunction connecting two noun phrases ('the child' and 'her mother'). - 'her mother' is another noun phrase. - 'clung' is the verb of the sentence, which agrees with its plural subject ('the child and her mother') in number. - Together forms an adverbial phrase modifying the verb 'clung'. So overall, the structure of the sentence is: Subject (Noun Phrase + Coordinating Conjunction + Noun Phrase) Verb (Adverb).
1	The sentence "This flyer and that flyer differ" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "this flyer and that flyer," which is a plural noun phrase referring to two separate flyers. The verb "differ" correctly agrees with the plural subject because it means "to be unlike in nature, form, or quality." Therefore, there is no grammatical error in this sentence.
0	The phrase "differ apart" is incorrect in this context. Instead, we should use the word "differ" alone or say "differ from each other." So a corrected version could be: "This flyer and that flyer differ," or "These flyers differ from each other."
0	This sentence is grammatically incorrect because it uses "scribble" inappropriately. To "scribble" means to write or draw carelessly or hurriedly, often resulting in illegible text. It would be unusual for a jeweler to sign a legal document (like a contract) by scribbling their name. A more appropriate verb might be something like "signed" or "wrote."
0	An acorn is a seed produced by oak trees, it does not grow from another oak tree. Therefore, the sentence "The gardener grew that acorn into an oak tree" is factually incorrect. A more accurate statement would be "The gardner planted that acorn which grew into an oak tree."
1	The sentence "I shaped a loaf" is grammatically correct in English. Here's why: * The subject of the sentence is "I," which is a pronoun that refers to the speaker or writer. It agrees with the verb in number (singular) and person (first). * The verb in the present tense is "shaped." This verb indicates an action performed by the subject on something else - in this case, a loaf. * The object of the verb is "a loaf," which is a noun phrase consisting of the indefinite article "a" followed by the singular countable noun "loaf." Since all these elements agree with each other and form a coherent structure, the sentence can be considered grammatically correct.
0	This sentence is grammatically incomplete because it lacks a main verb that indicates what the children did to be amused. A complete version of this sentence could be: "The children amused themselves." or "The clown amused the children."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence, "Susan", is doing the action "whispered" to the direct object "the news". There are no grammatical errors or awkward phrasing in this sentence.
1	The sentence "Susan whispered at Rachel" is grammatically correct. In this sentence, the subject (Susan) is performing an action (whispered) on the object (Rachel). The word "at" indicates the direction or location of the action, which is also correct in this context.
1	The sentence "Ellen said that melons were selling well" is grammatically correct. It consists of a main clause ("Ellen said") with an embedded content clause ("that melons were selling well"). Both clauses contain a subject (Ellen, melons) and a verb (said, selling), which makes them complete and grammatical. Additionally, the tense agreement between the two verbs is consistent as both are in past tense. Therefore, there are no grammar errors or awkward phrasings in this sentence, so it can be considered correct.
0	The sentence is incomplete as it does not specify what Ellen said about the present conditions. There needs to be a clause or phrase indicating what she actually said. For example, the corrected sentence could be: "Ellen said that the present conditions were challenging."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Ellen," who is doing the action of warning. "Helen" is the recipient of the warning, and "skating on thin ice" is what she is being warned against. The sentence follows a clear structure and uses proper grammar and punctuation.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Cynthia," which is a proper noun. The verb of the sentence is "nibbled," which indicates past tense action. The object of the sentence is "the carrot," which is a noun phrase. There are no grammatical errors in this sentence.
1	The sentence "Cynthia chewed" is grammatically correct. It consists of a proper noun (Cynthia) as the subject and a verb in past tense (chewed), which follows a simple sentence structure - Subject + Verb.
1	This is a grammatically correct English sentence. The verb "laughed" describes an action performed by the subject "Paul", and the preposition "at" introduces the object of the action "Mary". All elements in the sentence have clear roles and there are no grammatical errors or awkward phrasing.
0	The sentence "Linda winked her lip" is incorrect because people do not wink their lips; they typically wink one of their eyes instead. A correct version could be "Linda winked her eye."
0	The verb 'pound' in this context should be used with an object that is being struck or beaten rather than a subject who is performing the action. A more appropriate way to phrase the sentence would be "My heart is pounding" or "I can feel my heart pounding."
1	The sentence "Sharon fainted from hunger" is grammatically correct. In this sentence, the subject is "Sharon," the verb is "fainted," and the prepositional phrase "from hunger" explains why she fainted. There are no grammatical errors in this sentence, such as misspelled words, incorrect word order, or missing punctuation marks, so it can be considered a correctly written English sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in English. The subject of the sentence is "the witch," the verb is "poisoned," and the object is "the children." There are no grammatical errors or awkward phrasings that would make it difficult to understand.
1	The sentence "A grandfather clock ticked in the hallway" is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("a grandfather clock"), a verb ("ticked") and an adverbial of place ("in the hallway"). Additionally, all words are spelled correctly and there is a clear meaning to the sentence.
1	The sentence "I squeezed the door" would be incorrect because people typically do not have the physical ability to squeeze a door. However, "I sqeaked the door" is a grammatically correct sentence. In this context, "squeak" is used as a verb which means to make a high-pitched, squelching sound. It can also mean to cause something to make such a sound, which seems to be the intended meaning here. Therefore, the sentence is grammatically correct.
1	The sentence "Over the fire there bubbled a fragrant stew" is grammatically correct. The verb tense agrees with the subject, articles are used correctly, and the word order is appropriate for an active sentence in the past tense. Additionally, all words are spelled and capitalized correctly.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The word "soaring" is used as an adjective to describe the temperature, which is appropriate in this context. Additionally, the present continuous tense ("are predicted") is correctly utilized to indicate a future event that has already been forecasted. Lastly, "this weekend" specifies a particular time frame in the near future.
0	A fort cannot flutter because it is a large structure that does not have the ability to move in such a way. Flags can flutter, but not forts.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject ("the voices") agrees with the verb ("echoed"), and both words are correctly conjugated for third-person plural form. Additionally, the prepositional phrase "in the hall" provides more information about where the action took place. Therefore, there are no grammatical errors in this sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The verb "twists" agrees with its subject "the stream," and the prepositional phrase "through the valley" correctly describes where the action of twisting takes place.
0	The verb "present" in its form of past tense should be accompanied by the subject ("there") in objective case ("it"). Therefore, the grammatically correct version would be "It presented itself a wonderful opportunity yesterday," but it still sounds awkward because we usually say "such-and-such an opportunity presented itself." So for naturalness as well, I'd recommend saying something like "A wonderful opportunity came up yesterday."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The adjective "wonderful" modifies the noun "opportunity," and the subject "opportunity" is clearly identified as having been presented to "him." Additionally, the time expression "yesterday" specifies when the action occurred. Overall, the structure of the sentence is clear and easy to understand.
1	The sentence "Out of the box jumped a little white rabbit." is grammatically correct in English. It contains a subject ("a little white rabbit"), an action verb ("jumped"), and a prepositional phrase that modifies the verb ("out of the box"). All of the words are used correctly, so there is no reason to believe that this sentence is incorrect.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Penny," which is a noun that refers to a person or thing (in this case, a person). The verb in the sentence is "skated," which agrees with the singular subject "Penny" in number and tense. The preposition "around" indicates where the action occurred, followed by the object of the preposition, "the rink." Therefore, the structure of the sentence is clear and easy to understand, making it a grammatically correct English sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence, "Jackie," is performing an action on the object, "Rose." In this case, the action is "accompanied" which requires an object to complete its meaning. Therefore, the sentence is grammatically correct as it stands.
0	The verb in this sentence should agree with its subject in number. In this case, the subject of the sentence is "many information," which is plural. Therefore, the verb should also be plural, but instead it's singular ("was"). A corrected version of the sentence could be "Much information was provided" or "Many pieces of information were provided."
0	The word "advice" is an uncountable noun, so it does not take a plural form or the article "many." A correct version of the sentence would be "John offers much advice," or to use a countable noun with "many": "John offers many suggestions."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It compares two cakes (one obtained by Jones and another by Smith) using the comparative form of an adjective 'delicious' with the word 'more'. Also, it uses a conjunction 'than' to connect two clauses. Therefore, I would give it a score of 1 for grammaticality.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It uses a correlative conjunction ("not only...but also") to connect two ideas. In this case, it's recommending that someone eats less of both cake and pastries. This type of construction is often used to emphasize the similarity between two things. So in summary, the sentence suggests reducing the consumption of sweet baked goods for health or other reasons.
1	The sentence "I saw that gas can explode" is grammatically correct. It consists of a subject ("I"), an auxiliary verb ("saw") and a clause ("that gas can explode"). This type of clause functions as the direct object in the sentence and it's called content clause or noun clause. In this case, the clause expresses what the speaker saw (the potential for the gas to explode).
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in English. The subject of the sentence is "he" (a pronoun that refers to a male person), and the verb is "washed" (the past tense form of the verb "to wash"). The object of the sentence is "her", which indicates who or what was affected by the action of washing. Therefore, there are no grammatical errors in this sentence.
0	The sentence "Wash you!" is not grammatically correct in English. A correct version could be "Wash yourself" or "Wash you (subject pronoun) hands". In both cases, a verb form that agrees with the subject must be used.
0	The sentence "They have no in" is grammatically incorrect because it is missing a noun or pronoun after "no." A more appropriate way to phrase this idea would be "They have nothing," assuming that we want to convey the meaning of them being without something.
0	The adjective "some" needs to come after an article (a, an, or the) or another determiner (my, his, her, its, our, their). Therefore, the correct form of the sentence would be "Some of my jobs are in jeopardy."
0	The verb tense used with the subject of the first clause, "the policeman," does not agree with the rest of the sentence. A better way to phrase it would be "It was the policeman who met several young students in the park last night" or simply "The policeman met several young students in the park last night."
0	The sentence "did the policeman meet in the park?" is grammatically incorrect because it lacks a proper question word to begin the sentence. A more appropriate way to phrase the question would be "Did the policeman meet someone in the park?" or "Who did the policeman meet in the park?" This helps to clarify who or what the subject of the meeting was.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence, "John", is doing an action, which is expressed by the verb "put". We know what he is putting because of the object "old books" and we also know where he is putting them thanks to the prepositional phrase "in the box." All these elements make up a complete sentence with a clear structure, so it's grammatically sound!
0	The sentence "The monkeys proud of their leader" is grammatically incorrect because it lacks a verb. A corrected version could be "The monkeys are proud of their leader."
0	The sentence "John sounded very." is incomplete as it lacks a proper object or complement for the verb "sounded". It would be more grammatically correct to say something like "John sounded very tired" or "John sounded very good", etc.
1	The sentence "I don't know if I should agree" is grammatically correct in English. It expresses uncertainty about whether or not to give agreement on a particular matter.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence (John) is doing an action (bought), which is followed by what he bought (a book). The location where John bought the book is also specified (on the table). Therefore, it follows standard English grammar rules and is understandable.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence, "John", is performing the action of calling someone, as indicated by the verb "called". The object of the sentence is "the president", who is being referred to as a "fool" in this context. All elements of the sentence have clear roles and functions, making it a complete and proper English sentence.
1	The sentence "I forgot how good beer tastes." is grammatically correct in English. Here, "forgot" is used as a past tense verb that indicates the speaker's memory loss about something (how good beer tastes). It consists of a subject ("I"), an auxiliary verb ("did") which has been omitted but implied, a main verb ("forgot"), and an object clause ("how good beer tastes"). Therefore, it is a complete and coherent sentence without any grammatical errors or awkward phrasing.
1	The sentence "This teacher is a genius" is grammatically correct in English. There are no spelling errors or incorrect word choices. Additionally, the subject ("this teacher") and predicate ("is a genius") of the sentence agree in number (both singular), which satisfies another important grammatical rule. Therefore, I would classify this sentence as being correct.
0	The verb tense in this sentence is incorrect. It should be "has remained" instead of "is remained". Also, the word "by" is unnecessary in this context. A better way to phrase this sentence would be: "A good friend has been remaining to me by him." but even that doesn't sound natural. Instead we can say "He has remained a good friend to me."
1	The sentence "John ate his noodle quietly" is grammatically correct in English. Here's a breakdown of why it's correct: * "John" is a proper noun that refers to a person. Proper nouns always begin with a capital letter. * "ate" is the past tense of the verb "eat," which indicates an action performed by the subject (in this case, John). * "his" is a possessive determiner used to show ownership or association between the subject ("John") and the object ("noodle"). * "noodle" is a countable noun that can be singular or plural depending on context. In this case, since we're using the possessive determiner "his", we know there must be only one noodle being referred to. * "quietly" is an adverb modifying the verb "ate." It tells us how the action was performed. Overall, all the parts of speech fit together correctly in this sentence, making it grammatically valid.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence, a smith, is doing an action (hammering) to an object (the metal). There are no spelling errors or incorrect word choices. Therefore, it is a correctly written English sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence, "Sandy," is doing an action (removing) to a direct object, "her ballet shoes." There are no grammatical errors in this sentence, such as misspelled words or incorrect verb tense. Therefore, it can be considered a valid English sentence.
1	The sentence "This week will be a difficult one for us" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "this week," which is modified by the adjective "difficult." The verb in the sentence is "will be," which indicates that the statement is predicting something about the future. Finally, there's an object "one" referring to the week again, and it is followed by a prepositional phrase "for us". Therefore, the structure of the sentence is clear and easy to understand.
1	The sentence "Benny worked in a shoe factory when he was a student" is grammatically correct. It has a clear subject ("Benny"), verb ("worked"), and object ("a shoe factory"). Additionally, it utilizes an appropriate tense for describing past events with the phrase "when he was a student." No grammatical errors or awkward phrasings can be found in this sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "everyone," which is a plural noun referring to multiple people. The verb "hoped" agrees with the plural subject because it is also in the past tense form for third-person plural subjects (they hope(d)). The pronoun object "she" refers to one female person, but since we're talking about the hopes of many individuals (each hoping individually), using "she" instead of "they" doesn't make the sentence ungrammatical here. Lastly, the infinitive phrase "would sing" correctly follows the verb "hope." Overall, the structure of the sentence demonstrates proper agreement between its parts and clear syntax.
1	The sentence "This proved a decisive factor" is grammatically correct in standard English. It contains a subject ("this"), a verb tense that indicates past action ("proved"), and an object complement ("a decisive factor") to complete the meaning of the sentence.
0	This is incorrect because crocodiles do not eat doughnuts; they eat meat. Doughnuts are a type of food that humans consume.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "John", who is modified by the prepositional phrase "of Bill". The verb in the sentence is "is afraid", which agrees with its singular subject. There are no grammatical errors or awkward phrasings, so the sentence can be understood easily.
0	The sentence "John put under the bathtub" is grammatically incorrect because it lacks a direct object for the verb "put." A more complete and proper sentence could be "John put the soap under the bathtub" or "John put himself under the bathtub," depending on context.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence, "John," is doing the action of placing something or someone (in this case, "Kim"), which is indicated by the past tense verb "placed." The preposition "behind" tells us where the action was performed in relation to another object ("the garage"). All parts of speech are used correctly and there is a clear subject-verb agreement, making this an entirely valid English sentence.
0	The sentence "Kim depends for Sandy" is grammatically incorrect because it uses "depends for" instead of "depends on." A corrected version would be "Kim depends on Sandy."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence, "John", is doing an action, which is expressed by the verb "put". We also have a direct object of the sentence, "the book", that receives the action of putting. Finally, we have the prepositional phrase "in the box" which tells us where John put the book. Therefore, this sentence follows all the rules for grammatical structure and can be understood easily, making it a grammatically correct sentence.
1	The sentence "John taught English Syntax to new students" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a sentence with a subject (John), verb (taught), and object ("English Syntax") along with an indication of who received the action (new students).
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "John," who is performing the action of regarding someone. The object of his regard is "Bill," whom he considers to be a "good friend." Each part of the sentence is in its proper place, making it a complete and coherent thought.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence, "Kim," is performing the action denoted by the verb "put." The direct object of the sentence is "the box," which receives the action of being put into something else (we can assume from context that there is a larger container or area implied). Therefore, the structure of the sentence is clear and logical.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It consists of a subject ("The chickens"), a verb in the present tense that agrees with the plural subject ("seem"), an adverb modifying the verb ("fond"), and the object of the preposition ("of the farmer"). All parts of speech are correctly used together to form a complete thought.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It follows standard English syntax rules for subject-verb agreement (the plural subject "executives" matches with the plural verb "be") and word order. Additionally, it includes an appropriate preposition ("require that the executives be").
0	The verb tense in the first part of the sentence ("That Fred was unpopular") does not agree with the rest of the sentence. It would be more appropriate to say "Fred was unpopular" or "That Fred is unpopular." Additionally, the word "nominated" should come before "Bill," as in "That Fred nominated Bill." So a corrected version might read: "It's true that Fred was unpopular; he even nominated Bill for class president."
1	The sentence "They were taking a hard look at possible FTA" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "They" refers to one or more people who are performing an action. In this case, it serves as the subject of the sentence. * "were taking" represents the past continuous tense, which describes an ongoing action that was happening in the past. It agrees with the plural subject "they." * "a hard look" functions as an adverbial phrase modifying how they looked. This means they examined something carefully. * "at" introduces the prepositional phrase indicating where their attention was directed. * "possible FTA" specifies what they were looking at closely; here, "FTA" stands for Free Trade Agreement (assuming contextual knowledge). Since there could be multiple possibilities, "possible" indicates uncertainty about which specific agreement they were considering.
0	The phrase "against the book" is incorrect in this context. It seems that the speaker wants to say that John paid them back for a book, but instead they used an idiom "pay against (something)" which means to make payments on (a debt) before it is due. A correct way to express the intended meaning could be: "John paid me back for the book."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The verb "will study" agrees with its subject "the committee." Also, the object of the preposition "of" is "setting up," which is correctly followed by the gerund "setting." Finally, the phrase "a national computer network" is appropriately used as the direct object of the sentence.
0	The sentence "We made them be rude" is grammatically incorrect. A more appropriate way to phrase this idea would be "We made them act rudely." In the original sentence, "be rude" implies that their very nature or essence was changed into rudeness, which doesn't convey the intended meaning of making someone behave impolitely in a specific instance.
1	The sentence "After reading the pamphlet, Judy threw it into the garbage can." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of English syntax. It contains a clear subject ("Judy"), verb ("threw"), and object ("it") in an unambiguous order that makes sense to native speakers. Additionally, there are no spelling or punctuation errors present in the sentence.
0	The verb in the sentence must agree with its subject in number. In this case, the subject "students" is plural, so the verb should also be plural. Therefore, "reads" should be changed to "read". Here is the corrected version of the sentence: "Students studying English read Conrad's Heart of Darkness while at university."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject "I" is clear, and the verb "read" agrees with it in number. The phrase "some of the book" is a proper way to indicate that only part of the book was read. Therefore, there is no grammatical issue with this sentence.
1	The sentence "Most of the fruit is rotten" is grammatically correct. In this sentence, "most" is used as a determiner to indicate that the majority of the fruit is affected. It's followed by the preposition "of," which introduces the noun phrase "the fruit." Finally, we have the verb "is" (third-person singular present tense form of "to be") along with the adjective "rotten," describing the state of the fruit. So overall, the structure of this sentence is correct.
1	The sentence "Neither of students failed" is grammatically correct, but it is missing a determiner before "students". A more complete version could be "Neither of the students failed." However, since the prompt only asks for a binary judgment on grammaticality, I will still return 1 because there is no major grammar error that would make the sentence unintelligible or incorrect in context.
0	The correct form of the sentence should be "I drank some water" or "I drank some of the water". Including both "of" and an article ("the") before "water" would make it redundant in this context.
0	The noun "hair" should be plural in this context because it refers to many strands of gold-colored fibers on someone's head rather than just one strand. Therefore, the correct form would be "a golden head of hair."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("the boy"), an adverbial modifier of place ("in the doorway") that tells us where the action takes place, a verb ("waved") which indicates what the subject is doing, and an object ("to his father") who receives the action of the verb. All elements combine together smoothly without any grammatical errors or awkward constructions.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The phrase "it even tried to bite itself" indicates that the dog in question attempted to bite its own body, which is a behavior some dogs can exhibit due to various reasons such as anxiety or irritation.
0	The verb "wash" requires an object in the accusative case to complete its meaning. In English, we use the reflexive pronouns (e.g., myself, yourself, himself) when the subject of the sentence performs the action on itself. Therefore, the correct form of the sentence would be "He washed himself."
0	The sentence "John is easy to please Kim" is grammatically incorrect. The idiom "easy to please" should be followed by a verb in its infinitive form (to + base form of the verb). A corrected version would be "John is easy to please *Kim*." or "John pleases Kim easily.", depending on what was intended with the original sentence.
0	The sentence "There seemed to be intelligent" is grammatically incomplete as it lacks a proper noun or pronoun that indicates what or who seems to be intelligent. A possible correction could be "There seemed to be an intelligent person."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence, "John," is attempting to do something (try), which is specified by the infinitive phrase "to please Stephen." All elements of the sentence are used correctly and in the proper order.
0	The sentence "We believed John to be a fountain in the park" is grammatically incorrect because it assigns human qualities ("we believed") to an inanimate object ("John," who is referred to as a "fountain"). This creates a logical inconsistency that makes the statement nonsensical. Additionally, there's no context provided for why someone would believe another person to be a fountain or what relevance the location of the park has to this belief.
1	The sentence "It tries to leave the country" is grammatically correct. The subject "it" refers to some entity that is making an attempt, the verb "tries" indicates the effort being made, and the infinitive phrase "to leave the country" describes what action it is trying to do. Therefore, there is no grammatical error in this sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "John", a proper noun that refers to an individual person. The verb of the sentence is "tries", which indicates that John is making an attempt at something. In this case, what he is attempting is specified by the infinitive phrase "to leave the country". Infinitives consist of the word "to" followed by a base form of a verb; here, the infinitive is "leave". An infinitive can function as a noun in a sentence, often acting as the direct object or complement of the main verb. Overall, the structure of the sentence is clear and easy to understand.
1	The sentence "Under the bed seems to be a fun place to hide" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "Under the bed" correctly modifies the noun phrase "a fun place to hide." This prepositional phrase functions as an adjective describing where the fun place to hide is located. * The verb "seems" is used appropriately here because it indicates that the subject (the speaker or writer) has formed an opinion based on available evidence. In this case, the evidence suggests that being under the bed would be enjoyable for playing hide-and-seek or similar activities. * Each word in the sentence is spelled correctly, and there are no missing or extra words. Additionally, the punctuation marks are all placed properly.
0	The verb "is" should be used instead of "to be" after "there is believed." Also, "sheep" should be plural ("sheeps" is incorrect). So, a corrected version would be: "There is believed to be a sheep in the park," or even better, "It is believed that there are sheep in the park."
0	The verb tense used in the sentence is incorrect. The word "would" is unnecessary and grammatically incorrect when paired with "hope." A more appropriate way to phrase the sentence could be "I hope to study in France," or "I would like to study in France."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence, "John," is a proper noun and the verb, "can kick," is in the present tense. The direct object, "the ball," follows the verb as expected. Overall, there are no grammatical errors or awkward phrasings that would make this sentence incorrect.
0	The verb "rain" is an impersonal verb that cannot be used with a subject pronoun such as "he," "she," or "John." Instead of saying "John will rain tomorrow," we would say "It will rain tomorrow."
0	The verb tense in this sentence is incorrect. It should be either "We expect there to be rain" or "We expect it to rain." The first option uses a noun ("rain") after "be," while the second one uses a pronoun ("it"). Both options indicate that we anticipate future precipitation but use different grammatical structures to do so.
1	The sentence "John was found in the office" is grammatically correct. It consists of a noun phrase ("John"), a past tense verb ("was found") and a prepositional phrase ("in the office"). All elements are used correctly.
0	The verb tense used in this sentence is incorrect. In English, we would say either "Did the child go to school?" (past tense) or "Is the child in school?" (present tense). Therefore, the original question "Did the child be in the school?" is grammatically incorrect.
1	The sentence "It did not rain" is grammatically correct. The negation "not" is used correctly with the past tense of the verb "rain".
1	The sentence "John wants not to leave the town" is grammatically correct. Here, "not" is used as a negator with the base form of the verb "leave". It means that John has a desire or intention to stay in the town rather than leaving it.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the first clause is "Mary", followed by a verb phrase "likes to tour" and its object "art galleries". In the second clause, we have another subject "Bill", followed by a different verb phrase "hates to" and no object (which implies that Bill dislikes the action itself rather than any particular object). Both clauses use parallel structure and agree in tense ("likes" vs "hates"), making for a clear and coherent statement.
1	The sentence "They needn't take this exam" is grammatically correct. The word "needn't" is a contraction of "do not need to," which functions as a negated form of necessity or advice. In this case, it implies that taking the exam is not necessary for them.
1	The sentence "Ann may spend her vacation in Italy" is grammatically correct. It has a subject ("Ann"), an auxiliary verb ("may") that expresses possibility or permission, a main verb ("spend") in its base form, and an object ("her vacation"). Additionally, there is a prepositional phrase ("in Italy") which functions as an adverbial of place. All elements are arranged correctly, making it a valid English sentence.
1	The sentence "They love to play golf, but I do not." is grammatically correct. In the first part of the sentence, we have a plural subject ("they") followed by a verb in its base form ("love"). This is grammatically correct because third-person subjects (like "they") typically take verbs in their base form in present tense. The second part of the sentence starts with "but" which indicates a contrast with the previous statement. Then, it has the singular subject "I" followed by the contraction "do not", which is used for negating verbs in present tense. Therefore, the whole sentence is grammatically correct.
1	The sentence "George has spent a lot of money, hasn't he?" is grammatically correct. It is a question that uses a tag form ("hasn't he?") to elicit confirmation or denial from the listener about the statement made in the first part of the sentence ("George has spent a lot of money"). Both parts of the sentence are complete thoughts with proper verb agreement and punctuation.
0	The adverb "scarcely" means that something happened to only a small extent or degree. Therefore, it needs to be followed by a verb in the past simple tense (e.g., "He scarcely spoke."). In this case, the sentence uses the phrase "could do," which is incorrect. A better way to express this idea would be "As a statesman, he could scarcely do anything worth mentioning." Alternatively, the original sentence could work if rephrased as "Scarcely, as a statesman, could he do anything worth mentioning." However, both of these options require additional punctuation or phrasing for clarity.
1	The sentence "We never found any of the unicorns" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "We" is a subject pronoun used correctly as the agent performing the action in the sentence. * "never" is an adverb modifying the verb phrase "found." It indicates that the action did not occur at any time in the past. * "found" is the simple past tense form of the verb "find," which agrees with the subject "we." * "any" is a determiner used to indicate an unknown or unspecified amount of something. * "of the unicorns" is a prepositional phrase acting as an adjective phrase, specifying which unicorns were being searched for but not located. Overall, the sentence has a clear structure, proper grammatical components, and no errors in spelling or punctuation.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It would be even clearer if it specified which poet and what lines were being referred to, but as written, there is nothing incorrect about its structure or usage.
1	The sentence "Somebody apparently struck the unidentified victim during the early morning hours" is grammatically correct. There are no spelling errors or awkward phrasings in the sentence. Additionally, the subject ("somebody") agrees with the verb ("struck"), and the time of the event ("during the early morning hours") is clearly indicated. Therefore, I would rate this sentence as being completely grammatical.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It consists of a noun phrase ("the car"), a past tense verb ("was driven") and an optional past participle adjective form of the same verb ("driven"). All elements in this sentence have clear meaning and semantically fit together as well.
1	The sentence "Ricky can be relied on" is grammatically correct in standard English. It means that someone named Ricky can be trusted or depended upon to do something reliably.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The past tense of the verb "sleep" is "slept," so it's appropriate to say that "the bed was slept in." It means someone had used the bed for sleeping previously.
0	The sentence "A pound was weighed by the book" is grammatically incorrect because the verb tense is inconsistent. It would be more appropriate to say "The book weighed a pound." In this corrected version of the sentence, the subject ("the book") performs the action (weighing), which agrees with standard English grammar rules for verb agreement with the subject.
1	The sentence "Who do you think Tom saw?" is grammatically correct in English. It is a question asking for the identity of the person that someone thinks Tom saw.
1	The sentence "he had spent five thousand dollars" is grammatically correct in English. It consists of a simple past tense verb ("had spent") followed by the direct object ("five thousand dollars"). This structure conveys that someone (implied from context) used to spend a large amount of money in the past.
0	The pronoun "her" does not have a clear antecedent in the sentence. It's unclear who "her" refers to. A corrected version of the sentence could be "Fed knows which politician she should vote for." or "Fed knows which politician he should vote for.", depending on the intended meaning.
0	The sentence "How did you guess that he fixed the computer?" is grammatically incomplete as it lacks a main clause or an independent question. A complete version of this sentence could be something like "I'm surprised at how quickly you guessed that he fixed the computer." Alternatively, if we assume that there was a missing quotation mark before "he", making the sentence appear as follows: 'How did you guess "he fixed the computer"?', then it would still require additional context to make sense. In its current form, however, the sentence is ungrammatical and therefore merits a score of 0.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. Here's a breakdown of why: - "The committee" is a singular noun that agrees with its verb "knows." - "Whose" is used correctly as a possessive pronoun referring to an unknown person or group of people. - "Efforts" is a plural noun modified by "whose," indicating multiple actions taken by the individual or group being referred to. - "To achieve peace" functions as a prepositional phrase modifying "efforts," explaining what kind of efforts they were. - "The world" is a plural noun functioning as the indirect object of the sentence, receiving the action of honoring. - "Should honor" is in the future tense and expresses obligation on the part of the world. Overall, each element of the sentence has been constructed properly, making it grammatical.
0	The sentence is missing a question mark at the end to indicate that it is a question. The corrected sentence should be: "Which house does your friend live?"
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The phrase "from whom I bought these bagels" is a relative clause that modifies "the baker." It provides additional information about the identity of the baker. The word "whom" is used correctly as the object of the preposition "from," and it refers to the person who sold the bagels to the speaker.
1	The sentence "I found the place where we can relax." is grammatically correct. The subject "I" agrees with the verb "found," and the object "the place" is correctly used. Additionally, the clause "where we can relax" provides further context for the type of place being referred to, which is also grammatically sound. Therefore, the sentence is a valid English sentence and receives a score of 1.
0	The phrase "with whom" is unnecessary and redundant in this context because the verb "fell in love" already implies that Jenny has feelings for Jack. Therefore, a more appropriate way to phrase the sentence would be "Jack is the person Jenny fell in love with."
1	The sentence "There is a bench to sit on" is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("a bench"), an auxiliary verb ("is"), and an infinitive phrase ("to sit on") that functions as the object of the preposition "on." This structure creates a clear and complete thought, making the sentence proper in its construction.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "I", which is understood to be a person speaking. The verb is "met", indicating past tense action. The object of the verb is "the man". Finally, we have a relative clause modifying "the man": "who grows peaches." This is a correctly formed restrictive relative clause that tells us more about the specific man being referred to. Therefore, the sentence is grammatical.
1	The sentence "Which topic did you choose without getting his approval?" is grammatically correct. It contains a question asking about which topic was chosen without receiving someone's approval. All words are spelled correctly, and there are no punctuation or grammar errors in the sentence.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows the structure of a question in English with a subject ("you"), an auxiliary verb ("did"), a past participle verb form ("get"), and a prepositional phrase ("because Mary talked about"). Additionally, it includes a specific topic as the object of the preposition, which makes for a clear and coherent question.
1	The sentence "That is the reason why he resigned." is grammatically correct in standard English. It contains a subject ("that"), a linking verb ("is"), a noun serving as the complement of the linking verb ("the reason"), an adverb ("why"), and a past-tense verb with its subject ("he resigned"). All elements are used correctly and there are no spelling or grammar errors.
1	The sentence "It bothers me that John coughs" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "It" serves as a pronoun referring to an unspecified situation or thing that causes the speaker annoyance. * "bothers" is used correctly here as a verb indicating that something is causing distress or annoyance to the speaker. * "me" is a reflexive pronoun that refers back to the subject of the sentence (the speaker). * "that" introduces a subordinate clause which provides additional information about what is bothering the speaker. * "John" is a proper noun that refers to a specific person. * "coughs" is the third-person present tense form of the verb "to cough," which indicates that John has a persistent habit of coughing. Overall, all elements in the sentence are properly constructed and arranged, making it a grammatical and meaningful statement.
0	The verb in this sentence should agree with its subject in number. In this case, the subject "to please" is singular, so the verb must also be singular. However, the verb "is" used here is a third-person plural form, which does not match the subject. A correct version of this sentence would be "To please John is easy." or "Pleaseing John is easy.", depending on what you want to convey.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence, "Kim," is clearly identified, and the verb, "is," agrees with the singular subject. Additionally, the adjective "eager" modifies the subject appropriately, and the infinitive phrase "to please Tom" functions as the direct object of the sentence. Therefore, there are no grammatical errors in this sentence.
1	The sentence "That we invaded Iraq really bites" is grammatically correct in informal English. Here, "that" is a conjunction used to introduce a subordinate clause, "we invaded Iraq" is the subordinate clause acting as the subject of the sentence, and "really bites" is a colloquial expression that means something is unpleasant or unfortunate. Overall, it conveys disappointment or disapproval about the invasion of Iraq.
1	The sentence "It annoys me that Fido barks" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "It" serves as a pronoun referring to an unspecified thing or situation that causes annoyance. * "annoys" is used correctly here as a verb in the third person singular present tense, which requires an -s ending when the subject is he, she, or it (in this case, "it"). * "me" is used correctly as an object of the verb "annoy." * "that" introduces a subordinate clause expressing the reason for my annoyance. * "Fido" is a proper noun referring to a dog. * "barks" is a verb in the third person singular present tense, indicating what Fido does to cause my annoyance.
1	The sentence "Who achieved the best result was Angela." is grammatically correct in standard American English. It has a question word ("who") at the beginning to introduce an embedded question, followed by a verb tense that indicates past action or achievement ("achieved"), and it ends with a noun phrase ("Angela") as the subject of the sentence. Overall, the structure and syntax follow conventional rules for forming simple declarative statements in English.
1	The sentence "It was the peasant girl who got it" is grammatically correct. Here's a breakdown of why: * "it" serves as the subject of the sentence and refers to something previously mentioned or known from context. * "was" is an auxiliary verb used in past tense for the third person singular (subject) "it." * "the peasant girl" is a noun phrase that functions as the predicate (doer of the action). It contains the definite article "the," which indicates a specific instance, followed by the adjective "peasant" modifying the noun "girl." * "who" introduces a relative clause that describes the antecedent ("peasant girl"). * "got" is the main verb in past tense indicating that the action has been completed. * "it" is the direct object of the sentence, receiving the action of "got." Overall, all parts of speech are correctly placed and agree with one another, making the sentence grammatically correct.
0	The sentence contains a grammatical error. It should be "That kind of person is hard to find anyone who can look after them," instead of "anyone to look after." Additionally, it's unclear whether "them" refers to that kind of person or someone else, so I would recommend specifying that in the sentence as well.
1	The sentence "A sick owl doesn't hunt mice" is grammatically correct in standard English. It follows a clear subject-verb-object structure with proper punctuation and capitalization.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It means that anyone who expresses an interest in studying semantics and applies for admission to the department will be accepted.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It consists of two independent clauses joined by the coordinating conjunction "and". Both clauses contain the subject-verb-object structure required for a complete sentence. Additionally, there is no missing punctuation or capitalization errors.
1	The sentence "I'm sure we even got these tickets!" is grammatically correct in informal English contexts. Here, 'even' emphasizes that obtaining the tickets was also among the things that were achieved or expected, which makes sense in this context.
0	The sentence contains a double negative ("even" and "not"), which can make it unclear what the speaker means. It would be clearer to say "I'm sure we got these tickets!" or "I'm not sure we got these tickets," but using both negatives in the same sentence creates confusion.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The clause "It's not because I have any sympathy for urban guerrillas" provides a reason for why the subject did something, and the independent clause "that I helped him" describes the action taken by the subject. Both clauses are linked together using the subordinating conjunction "that", making the overall structure of the sentence clear and coherent.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The word "that" is used correctly to introduce a subordinating clause, which explains the reason for the speaker's anger. Additionally, the verb tenses are consistent throughout the sentence, with the past tense of "Sue said" contrasting with the present tense of "I'm angry." Overall, the sentence is clear and concise in its meaning.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The clause "That he was hungry" is a subordinate clause that provides additional information about John's state before the main action of whining takes place. It is set off by a comma to show that it is nonessential to understanding the meaning of the sentence.
0	In English grammar, it's generally required that the word "after" be followed by a clause or phrase indicating what happened afterward, rather than simply naming the thing that occurred afterward (in this case, "the party"). A correct version of this sentence would be something like "I gave Mary a book after the party ended." Alternatively, if referring to an event that took place at the party, one could say "I gave Mary a book after she sneezed," for example.
0	The second part of the sentence after the conjunction 'but' or 'and' should be in a consistent tense with the first part of the sentence. Here, "I really like her" is in present tense which does not match with past tense used in the first part i.e., "she's so pleasant". A grammatically correct version would be - "Because she's so pleasant, I really like Mary."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("he"), an adverb clause modifying the subject ("Though he may hate those that criticize Carter,"), and a concluding independent clause expressing indifference ("it doesn't matter"). Each part of the sentence is punctuated correctly, so no corrections need to be made.
0	The sentence "With no job would John be happy." is grammatically incorrect. A more appropriate way to phrase it could be "John would not be happy without a job" or "Without a job, John wouldn't be happy."
0	The correct form of this sentence should be "I have **much** of the manuscript **left** to type," or it could also be "I have a lot of the manuscript left to type." This is because we use 'much' with uncountable nouns (like water, money etc.) and 'many' with countable nouns (like apples, books etc.). Similarly, when referring to remaining quantity of something, we can say 'left'.
1	The sentence "He's a more reliable man" is grammatically correct in English. It uses the comparative form of an adjective ("more") to compare two things (the subject's reliability), which is perfectly acceptable usage. Additionally, the verb tense agrees with the subject, making for a complete and proper sentence.
0	The sentence "Any trouble is what I don't want" is grammatically incorrect. A more appropriate way to express this idea would be "I don't want any trouble." In this corrected version, "any trouble" serves as the direct object of the verb "want," which makes the sentence clearer and easier to understand.
1	The sentence "They may grow as high as bamboo" is grammatically correct in English, although it might be more clear if rephrased to say something like "They may grow as tall as bamboo." However, without additional context or information about what specifically is growing, it's difficult to definitively say whether the sentence is semantically accurate. Nonetheless, from a grammatical standpoint, there is nothing incorrect with the sentence.
1	The sentence "Some of them made as many errors as 20." is grammatically correct. Here, 'some' refers to an unspecified amount or number of people, 'of them' is a pronoun used to indicate those same people, 'made' is the past tense of the verb 'make', 'as many errors' means the same quantity of mistakes, and 'as 20' indicates that they made the same (or very similar) number of errors as twenty individuals would have made. Therefore, it is a proper sentence in English with no grammatical issues.
0	The sentence "Sally kissed himself" is grammatically incorrect because "himself" is a reflexive pronoun that refers back to the subject of the sentence, which in this case is "Sally". However, the masculine singular form of the reflexive pronoun should be used when referring to a female subject like Sally. Therefore, the correct sentence would be "Sally kissed herself."
1	The sentence "Drew believes I think Rosie loves magazine ads" is grammatically correct. Here's a breakdown of why: * "Drew" is a proper noun used as the subject of the first clause. * "believes" is a verb that indicates what Drew does in relation to the rest of the clause. * "I" is a pronoun used as the subject of the second clause. * "think" is a verb that indicates what the speaker (the person referred to by "I") does in relation to the rest of the clause. * "Rosie" is another proper noun used as the subject of the third clause. * "loves" is a verb that indicates what Rosie feels about the object of her affection. * "magazine ads" is a plural noun phrase that serves as the direct object of the verb "loves." Each clause has a clear subject-verb relationship, making the overall structure of the sentence clear and easy to follow. Therefore, it can be considered grammatically correct.
1	The sentence "Dave, Dan, Erin, Jaime, and Alina left" is grammatically correct. It contains a subject (Dave, Dan, Erin, Jaime, and Alina) and a verb (left), which expresses a complete thought. All of the proper nouns are spelled correctly and there are no grammatical errors or awkward phrasings in the sentence. Therefore, I would rate this sentence as being grammatically correct.
1	The sentence "Hopefully, we'll make it through the winter without snow." is grammatically correct. The word "hopefully" indicates a hope or desire for something to happen in the future, which is expressed by the contraction "we'll," short for "we will." The phrase "make it through" means to succeed in doing something difficult or challenging, such as surviving a harsh winter. Finally, the clause "without snow" explains what would make the success particularly notable. Overall, the sentence has a clear structure and meaning, so it can be considered grammatically correct.
0	The subject of the sentence must be a singular or plural noun rather than an adjective such as "blue." Also, pronouns should agree in number with their antecedents; here, "herself" does not correctly refer to anything previously mentioned in the sentence. Lastly, verbs should also agree in tense and number with their subjects. Therefore, the corrected version would read something like "The blue leather bag shows how pretty Betsy is," assuming there's some context indicating why we might describe her prettiness through her possession of a 'blue leather bag'.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence (Gwen) is doing an action (hit), which is expressed by the verb, to a direct object (the baseball). Both subjects and verbs must agree in number, so since "Gwen" is singular, "hit" must also be singular. In this case, both "Gwen" and "hit" are grammatically consistent with each other, making the overall structure of the sentence valid.
0	The sentence "I hit that you knew the answer" is grammatically incorrect. A more appropriate way to phrase it could be "I hinted that you knew the answer" or "I realized that you knew the answer." In this case, "hit" does not make sense in context with what seems to be intended meaning of providing a clue (hint) or coming to an understanding (realized).
1	The sentence "I've lost my wallet or I've lost my mind" is grammatically correct. It uses the correlative conjunction "or" to connect two independent clauses, each with a verb in the present perfect tense ("have lost"). This structure correctly conveys that one of these events has occurred but does not specify which one.
1	The sentence "It was a brand new car that he bought" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "it," which refers to something previously mentioned or understood in context. The predicate indicates that the thing being referred to is "a brand new car." Finally, we have the dependent clause "that he bought," providing additional information about how the speaker or writer came into possession of the car. All elements of the sentence are used correctly, so it is grammatical.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject 'he' is used consistently throughout the sentence, and each clause contains a verb ('likes', 'hates') followed by its object ('cookies', 'crumb cake'). There are no obvious spelling or punctuation errors.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The verb "chased" agrees in number with its subject "they," and the prepositional phrase "with the car" modifies the noun "man." Additionally, the meaning of the sentence is clear - a group of people pursued someone who was in or near a car.
1	The sentence "I didn't have a red cent" is grammatically correct. It is an idiomatic expression in American English that means the speaker had no money at all.
0	The sentence "the book of poems and from Blackwell takes a very long time to read" is grammatically incorrect. It seems that the speaker wants to say something about two different books - one "the book of poems" and another one from Blackwell's. However, it is unclear how these two books relate to each other in this sentence. To make it clearer, we could rephrase it as follows: "Reading the book of poems and the one from Blackwell takes a very long time."
1	The sentence "the one with a red cover takes a very long time to read" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "The one with a red cover" is a noun phrase that refers to an object or person with a distinctive feature (in this case, having a red cover). It functions as the subject of the sentence. * "takes" is the main verb in the present tense, indicating that the action of taking a long time to read is happening now or is a habitual behavior. * "a very long time" is an adverbial phrase modifying the verb "to read", specifying how long it takes to complete the action. * Overall, the sentence has a clear structure and meaning, making it grammatically correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence, "John," is followed by a verb in the third-person singular form, "has." The object of the sentence is "a fear of dogs," which is correctly constructed with an article ("a") before the noun phrase "fear" and the preposition "of" introducing the noun phrase "dogs." Overall, the syntax and word choice are appropriate for standard English usage.
0	In English grammar, we usually use a possessive form (such as "the building's") to relate a noun directly to what comes after it in the same phrase or clause. Therefore, saying "the building's the roof" implies that "the roof" belongs to "the building," which doesn't make sense in this context since the intended meaning seems to be that the roof of the building is leaking. A more appropriate way to phrase the original sentence would be, "The roof of the building is leaking."
0	The correct form of this sentence would be "the panther's coat is dark black." In English, we do not add an article ("the") before a possessive noun (in this case, "panther's"). So, the corrected version of the sentence is "The panther's coat is dark black."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The auxiliary verb "could" is used correctly to make a polite request in indirect speech, and the subject ("they") agrees with its verb in number. Additionally, there are no missing or extraneous words that would make the sentence difficult to understand.
0	This sentence is grammatically incorrect because it implies that two separate events are connected by the word "and." However, there's no conjunction or punctuation separating the two actions performed by "the man" in this sentence. A correct version could be: "The man I saw got into the cab and robbed the bank," or "The man I saw had gotten into a cab and then robbed the bank."
1	The sentence "I know you eat asparagus." is grammatically correct. In this sentence, the subject (I) is referring to the speaker, and the object (you) refers to someone else. Additionally, the verb "eat" agrees with the second person singular pronoun "you," and "asparagus" is a valid noun that serves as the direct object of the sentence. Overall, there are no grammatical errors in this sentence.
1	The sentence "John's drum will always bother me" is grammatically correct. Here we have a noun phrase ("John's drum") functioning as the subject of the sentence, followed by a helping verb ("will"), an auxiliary verb ("always"), and the main verb ("bother"). The pronoun "me" serves as the direct object of the sentence. All elements fit together appropriately to form a coherent and complete thought.
1	The sentence "An evil thought struck Dave" is grammatically correct. Here, 'an' is a determiner used before a singular noun starting with a vowel sound (in this case, the letter 'e'). Additionally, the verb tense agrees with the subject - 'thought' being the past tense of 'think'.
1	The sentence "In the classroom John put the book on the table." is grammatically correct. It has a clear subject ("John"), verb ("put"), and object ("the book"). The prepositional phrases "in the classroom" and "on the table" provide additional context for where the action took place. All of the words in the sentence are used correctly, so there's no reason to believe that it's not an accurate representation of what happened.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence, "Phillip", is doing an action ("gave") to a direct object, "the medal". There is also an indirect object in the sentence, "to the soldier", which receives the direct object. All these elements form a complete thought making it a proper sentence.
0	The verb "to eat" in this context requires an object, which should be placed immediately after the verb. In addition, the word "flavored" must modify a noun directly, without any prepositions such as "of" or "with." A grammatically corrected version of the sentence would be: "Heidi thinks that Andy should eat salmon-flavored candy bars."
1	The sentence "Heidi thinks that Andy should eat salmon flavored candy bars" is grammatically correct in standard English. Each word is spelled correctly and used appropriately for its intended meaning. Additionally, the structure of the sentence follows common English syntax rules with a subject ("Heidi"), a verb ("thinks") and an object ("that Andy should eat salmond flavored candy bars"). All punctuation marks are also placed correctly within the sentence. Therefore, it can be concluded that this sentence is grammatically correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in English. It consists of a single clause with a simple past tense verb ("danced") that agrees with its subject ("he"). The word order follows standard English syntax rules, making it an acceptable sentence on its own without any additional context needed for understanding.
0	The sentence "Did Calvin his homework?" is grammatically incorrect because it lacks a helping verb such as "did" or "does" before "his." A correct version of the sentence would be "Did Calvin do his homework?" or "Does Calvin have homework to do?" which both use the proper word order for forming questions in English.
1	The sentence "Sylvia was slapping Jeff upside the head in martial arts class" is grammatically correct. Here's a breakdown of why it's correct: * "Sylvia" is the subject of the sentence, and she is identified as the person doing the action. * "was slapping" is the verb phrase, indicating that the action happened in the past. * "Jeff" is the object of the sentence, receiving the action from Sylvia. * "upside the head" describes where Sylvia was slapping Jeff. * "in martial arts class" provides additional context for the setting of the action.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The conditional structure ("if" clause followed by "would" + base form of the verb) is used appropriately to express a hypothetical situation and its consequence.
1	This sentence uses the subjunctive mood in English, which is used to create hypothetical or unlikely situations. The verb "were" is used instead of "was" after "he," even though "he" is singular, because it indicates a hypothetical situation. Therefore, the sentence is grammatically correct.
1	The sentence "John is likely to leave" is grammatically correct. Here, 'likely' is used as an adverb modifying the verb 'to leave', indicating that it is probable or expected for John to depart. No grammatical errors can be found in the structure of this sentence, so I am returning a 1 for being grammatically correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence, "the manager," is a singular noun that is followed by a verb in the past tense, "laughed." Since we know that managers can laugh, there is no ambiguity or incorrect grammar present in this sentence.
0	This sentence is incomplete as it lacks a proper subject and verb agreement. A complete version of this sentence could be something like "The ship was sunk," where there's a clear subject (the ship) and a corresponding verb form (was sunk).
0	The sentence contains a mistake in word order known as subject-verb agreement. In this case, "did" (past tense of do) does not agree with its plural subject "you". A correct version would be "Who did you think KISSED the gorilla?" or better yet, to avoid using auxiliary verb twice, we can say "Who thought someone had kissed the gorilla?"
1	The sentence "Have you seen my model airplane collection?" is grammatically correct in English. It follows a standard structure with an auxiliary verb ("have"), a subject pronoun ("you"), and a main verb ("seen") that agrees with the subject in number. Additionally, there are no spelling or punctuation errors present in the sentence.
1	The sentence "It seems that Lucy was mugged" is grammatically correct in standard English. The subject of the sentence is "it," which refers to a general situation or idea; "seems" is the linking verb connecting the subject to its complement, "that Lucy was mugged." This clause functions as the direct object of the sentence and uses the past tense of the passive voice ("was mugged") to describe an event that happened to someone else (Lucy). Overall, there are no grammatical errors in this sentence, so it returns 1 for being correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "I", which is the person who performed the action. The verb is "ate", which describes the action taken by the subject. The object of the sentence is "a salad", which received the action. Finally, the phrase "that was filled with lima beans" provides additional information about the salad. All of these elements come together to form a complete, grammatically correct sentence.
1	The sentence "There were four men arriving at the station when I pulled up" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * The subject of the sentence, "there," agrees with the verb "were." * The plural noun "men" also agrees with the verb "were." * The present participle phrase "arriving at the station" correctly modifies the subject. * The adverbial clause "when I pulled up" provides additional information about the time frame in which the action occurred. It does not interfere with the grammatical structure of the main clause.
1	The sentence "Jean is reluctant to dance" is grammatically correct in standard English usage. Here, "reluctant" serves as an adjective modifying the subject "Jean," while "to dance" functions as an infinitive verb phrase that describes what Jean is reluctant about. Overall, the structure of the sentence is clear and concise, making it a valid English expression.
1	The sentence "I want her to dance" is grammatically correct in English. It consists of a subject ("I"), an auxiliary verb ("want"), a pronoun object ("her") and an infinitive verb phrase ("to dance"). All elements have their proper form according to the grammatical rules, so the whole sentence is perfectly understandable and coherent.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence, "Jean," is performing the action of persuading, which is indicated by the verb "persuaded." The object of the sentence is "Robert," who is receiving the action. Therefore, there are no grammatical errors in this sentence.
1	The sentence "Jean wants Bill to do the Macarena" is grammatically correct. It consists of a proper noun (Jean) followed by a verb in base form ("wants"), another proper noun (Bill), an infinitive marker ("to") and a gerund verb phrase ("doing the Macarena"). All elements fit together correctly and there are no spelling or punctuation errors.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It consists of a subject ("the children"), a verb ("admire"), and an object ("their mother"). There are no grammatical errors or awkward phrasings in this sentence.
1	The sentence "Who has Peter talked with?" is grammatically correct. It is a question asking about who Peter had a conversation with in the past.
1	The sentence "Heidi likes her violin" is grammatically correct in English. Here's why: * "Heidi" is a proper noun (a name) that refers to a specific person. Proper nouns always start with a capital letter. * "likes" is a verb in the present tense that indicates a preference or enjoyment of something. It agrees with the subject "Heidi." * "her" is a possessive pronoun that shows ownership or association between two things. In this case, it implies that Heidi has a particular violin that belongs to her. * "violin" is a singular countable noun that represents a musical instrument played by drawing a bow across its strings. Overall, each word in the sentence plays a role, making it complete and coherent.
0	The pronoun "himself" in this context refers to "John", but it is reflexive possessive pronoun which needs to refer back to the subject of the main clause ("John"). Therefore, using "himself" here creates an incorrect agreement between the subject and object; instead, we need to use the objective form of the pronoun for "he". So the correct version would be: "John thinks that Mary loves him."
0	The sentence "Which pictures of himself does John like?" contains a grammatical error. It should be "Which pictures of HIM does John like?" instead. In the original sentence, "himself" is redundant because we already have the subject "John." Additionally, if we want to use a reflexive pronoun, it would need to refer back to "pictures," but that's not what we mean here. So, in summary, the corrected version of the sentence should be "Which pictures of him does John like?"
0	The indefinite article 'an' should be used instead of 'a' before a vowel sound. In this case, although 'o' is a consonant, when pronounced, it starts with a vowel sound (like 'owe'). So, the corrected sentence should be: "Any *an* owl hunts mice."
0	The sentence contains a double negative ("didn't" and "no"), which can lead to confusion in meaning. A better way to phrase it would be "No man ate dinner" or "Any man failed to eat dinner."
1	The sentence "A pilot could be flying this plane" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "A pilot" is a singular noun phrase that refers to an individual who operates an airplane or other aircraft. It is indefinite because it does not refer to a specific person. * "could be flying" is a modal verb construction followed by a present participle form of the verb "to fly." Modal verbs such as "can," "could," "may," "might," "must," "shall," and "should" express various degrees of possibility or necessity. In this case, "could" suggests that there is a hypothetical situation where the action of flying the plane might occur. * "this plane" is a demonstrative pronoun combined with a definite article ("this") and a plural countable noun ("plane"). Demonstratives indicate proximity (physical or temporal) between the speaker and the entity being referred to. Here, "this" implies that the plane is nearby or already known to the listener. Therefore, the sentence conveys a possible scenario where someone who meets the criteria for being called a pilot may operate the particular airplane mentioned.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It uses a subordinate clause ("whoever they were") to refer back to the subject of the main clause ("Everybody"). This type of construction is called a relative clause, which functions as an adjective modifying the noun in the main clause. In this case, it tells us more about the people who attended the rally.
1	The sentence "Anybody who attended last week's huge rally signed the petition" is telling a friend about an event that already happened. It implies that people who went to the big rally last week have all signed some petition as a collective action in the past tense. This usage of tenses is grammatically correct.
0	While it's true that many tigers have orange fur and black stripes, not all tigers do. Some species of tigers, such as the South China Tiger and the Sumatran Tiger, have a different color pattern altogether. Therefore, the statement "Any tiger has orange fur, marked with black stripes" is incorrect because it implies that every single tiger in existence has this appearance, which is not the case.
0	Albinism in animals, including tigers, results in a lack of pigmentation, which gives them white or pale fur, not orange as stated in the sentence. Their distinctive stripes remain, but they appear darker due to contrast with the lighter fur color.
1	The sentence "You must pick any flower you see" is grammatically correct in English. Here's a breakdown of why it's correct: * "You must" is a proper way to express a requirement or obligation. * "pick" is the base form of the verb that agrees with the subject "you." * "any flower" is a correctly formed noun phrase where "any" acts as a determiner for the singular countable noun "flower." * "you see" is an adverbial clause modifying the main clause, which adds information about when or under what circumstances the action takes place.
1	The sentence "Any pilot on duty today could be flying this plane" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "Any" is used as a determiner to refer to an unspecified person or thing. In this case, it refers to any pilot who is currently on duty. * "pilot" is a noun that refers to someone who operates an aircraft. * "on duty" means performing one's job or responsibilities during a specific time period. In this context, it refers to pilots who are currently working. * "today" is an adverb of time that indicates the present day. * "could be" expresses possibility in the present tense. It implies that there is a chance or likelihood that something might happen. * "flying" is the present participle form of the verb "to fly." It describes the action of operating an aircraft in flight. * "this plane" refers to a particular airplane that is being discussed. Therefore, the sentence conveys the idea that any pilot who is currently on duty has the potential or ability to operate the specific airplane being referred to.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It means that one can pick most of the flowers, but they must ensure to leave some behind specifically for someone named Mary.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It indicates that the Dodgers won a game against the Red Sox but lost another game to the Giants. Both clauses in the sentence have a subject ("the Dodgers") and a verb ("beat" or "were beaten"), making it clear what actions were taken and who performed them.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It has a question form with the subject-auxiliary inversion (in which car was), an object ("the man") and a past participle ("seen").
0	This sentence is grammatically incorrect because it uses a singular verb ("computed") with two plural subjects ("the man who Mary loves" and "Sally"). Additionally, there's no conjunction between the two phrases describing what each person does to the man (loves vs. hates). A correct version of this sentence could be: "The man whom both Mary loves and Sally hates computed my tax."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. Here's a breakdown of why: * "The kennel" is a noun phrase that serves as the subject of the sentence. It refers to a specific kennel (a shelter or bed for dogs) constructed by Mary. * "which Mary made" is a relative clause modifying "the kennel." It tells us more about the kennel, specifying who created it. * "and Fido sleeps" is another relative clause providing additional information about the same kennel; in particular, that Fido, presumably a dog, uses it for sleeping. * "has been stolen" is the verb phrase expressing the action taken upon the kennel - someone took it away unlawfully. Thus, the structure of the sentence can be represented as follows: [Subject: The kennel which Mary made and Fido sleeps] + [Verb Phrase: has been stolen].
1	The sentence "Tom said he would and Bill actually did eat a raw eggplant" is grammatically correct in English. It contains two independent clauses ("Tom said he would..." and "Bill actually did eat a raw eggplant") connected by the conjunction "and". Both subjects (Tom and Bill) and verbs (said and ate) agree in number, making the sentence syntactically sound. Additionally, there are no obvious spelling or punctuation errors that could make it incorrect.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. There are no spelling errors or awkward phrasings, and all of the words fit together well in terms of syntax and meaning. Additionally, there's nothing particularly unusual about the content of the sentence; it describes a common scenario involving a person buying a gift for someone they care about. Therefore, I would rate this sentence as being completely grammatical and idiomatic in standard English.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in standard English. It consists of a subject ("the dog"), an auxiliary verb ("stole") which agrees with the subject in number (singular), and an object ("the turkey"). All elements needed for a complete sentence are present, so it's considered grammatically correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It consists of a noun phrase ("a tall building") that contains an adjective ("tall") modifying the head noun ("building"). The determiner ("a") specifies which particular instance of "building" we're talking about. Overall, it's a complete and coherent sentence fragment that conveys information without requiring additional context or words to make sense.
1	The sentence "This building is tall" is grammatically correct. It has a subject ("this building"), a verb ("is"), and a complement ("tall"). There are no spelling or punctuation errors, and the word order follows standard English rules. Therefore, I would classify this as a correct English sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The speaker is expressing their fondness for a specific book that was gifted to them by the listener.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence, "Captain Wentworth," is performing the action of writing a letter, which is indicated by the verb "wrote." The object of the sentence, "a letter," receives the action of being written. Additionally, we are told that the letter was addressed to "Anne Elliott," providing necessary context for the sentence. Overall, the structure of the sentence is clear and easy to understand, making it grammatically sound.
0	In the embedded question "was Alison coming to the party," the auxiliary verb "was" should be in the base form "be." The corrected sentence should read as follows: "She asked **was** *Alison* coming to the party?" or "She asked if **Alison was** coming to the party."
1	The sentence "They realized that never had Sir Thomas been so offended" is grammatically correct in formal written English. It uses an inversion to place emphasis on "never," which indicates a strong degree of surprise or contrast. This structure is often used in literary writing.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Fanny", the verb is "regretted", and the object is "having to talk to Aunt Noris". There are no grammatical errors in this sentence.
1	The sentence "Knowing the country well, he took a short cut" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "Knowing the country well" is a participial phrase that modifies the subject of the main clause (he). Participial phrases can function as adjectives to describe or modify nouns in a sentence. In this case, it tells us more about the person taking the shortcut. * "He took a short cut" is a simple and complete main clause with a clear subject ("he") and predicate ("took a short cut"). It expresses a completed action in the past tense. * Together, these two clauses form a compound sentence connected by a comma splice, which is acceptable in informal writing but may be considered incorrect in formal contexts. However, since there is no specific requirement for formality in the instructions, I will assume that an informal style is acceptable here.
1	The sentence "He left the train with somebody else's wallet in his pocket." is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("he"), an action verb ("left") that agrees with the subject in number and tense, a preposition ("with") followed by a noun phrase ("somebody else's wallet in his pocket"). All of these elements form a complete thought, making it a grammatically correct sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence, "Magnus," is a proper noun that refers to a person's name. The verb in the sentence, "went," is in the past tense and agrees with the subject. Finally, "to Ireland" correctly identifies the destination using a preposition ("to") followed by a country name. Therefore, I would classify this as a grammatically correct English sentence.
0	The sentence "Who did John send the book?" is grammatically incomplete because it lacks a proper question word at the beginning to make the subject clear. A better way to phrase this would be "To whom did John send the book?" or "Who was the recipient of the book that John sent?"
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject ("the idea") has a verb ("dismayed"), and it is followed by a clause beginning with the conjunction "that," which provides additional information about what the idea did (it "dismayed" the Prime Minister). Within this clause, there is another subject ("the Dome") and its predicate adjective ("was dull"). All of these elements combine to form a complex but grammatically sound sentence.
0	In English grammar, it's generally required to include a subject before the verb when constructing a sentence. The sentence provided lacks a clear subject at the beginning of the sentence. A more appropriate way to phrase the sentence would be: "He came right in without so much as a knock."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence, "Harriet," is followed by a verb in past tense, "admired." The object of the sentence is "Mr. Knightley," which is a proper noun. Therefore, there are no grammatical errors in this sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence ("the book") agrees with the verb ("is"), and the adjective ("boring") correctly modifies the noun.
1	The sentence "Ethel wishes to ask you some awkward questions" is grammatically correct in standard English. There are no spelling errors or punctuation mistakes, and the word order follows normal conventions for a declarative statement. Additionally, all of the words used make sense in their intended context. Therefore, I would classify this as a grammatically correct English sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence, "Emma," is doing an action (made) to someone else, indicated by "Harriet." Additionally, there is a direct object, "some food," which explains what was made.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It describes an action (the breaking of the window) caused by an agent using a tool (a person using a hammer). The verb tense is consistent and clear, making the meaning easily understandable.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. Here's a breakdown of why: * "The fugitive" is a noun phrase that refers to someone who is fleeing from justice or escapeing from captivity. It serves as the subject of the sentence. * "lay" is the past tense of the verb "lie," which means to be in a horizontal position. In this context, it indicates that the fugitive was deliberately staying still and quiet. * "in order to avoid discovery" is a prepositional phrase that functions as an adverbial clause modifying the main clause ("the fugitive lay motionless"). It explains the reason for the fugitive's action (i.e., to prevent being found by others).
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. Here, "the" is used as a definite article to indicate specific guards and prisoners, and "round" is used here as an adverb meaning "in circles." So, the sentence means that the particular group of guards were making the specified group of prisoners walk in circles around the prison yard.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in English. The subject of the sentence, "Frank Churchill," is performing the action described by the verb, "crossed." Additionally, the preposition "the" before "street" indicates which specific street he crossed.
1	The sentence "Emma and Harriet were attacked yesterday" is grammatically correct. It has a clear subject ("Emma and Harriet"), verb tense (past tense with "were attacked"), and time reference ("yesterday"). There are no spelling errors or missing words in the sentence. Therefore, it can be considered as a proper English sentence.
1	The sentence "Fiona might be here by 5 o'clock" is grammatically correct. It indicates a possibility that Fiona could arrive by five in the afternoon, which is a common way to express uncertainty about someone's arrival time.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The word "and" connects two phrases together, each with its own verb ("expecting" and "is"). This structure shows a parallelism which makes the sentence clearer and easier to understand. Additionally, there's no missing punctuation or misspelled words in the sentence.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It indicates that a person named Pat received an award called the Golden Fleece Award and felt unhappy or disappointed about it. There is nothing incorrect in terms of grammar, spelling, punctuation, or word usage.
0	The sentence "Kim alienated cats and beating his dog" is grammatically incorrect. There are a couple of issues with it. First, there is no verb connecting the two clauses, "Kim alienated cats" and "beating his dog". Second, "beating" is a present participle that needs to be connected to a subject and auxiliary verb to form a proper clause. A corrected version could be "Kim alienated the cats and was beating his dog," or better yet, "Kim alienated the cats and beat his dog."
1	The sentence "They knew that pictures of each other would be on sale" is grammatically correct. The subject "they" agrees with the verb "knew". Also, the phrase "pictures of each other" is a proper way to refer to pictures depicting all the people in a group. Therefore, there are no grammatical errors or awkward phrasings in the sentence.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It uses the singular indefinite article "a" before a consonant sound (in this case, "article") and implies that there was only one specific article that Terry failed to read before filing it.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The speaker expresses their intention to attempt buying whiskey.
0	The sentence has a grammatical error. It should be "She goes and buys some whiskey." instead of "she goes and buying some whiskey". In the present continuous tense (is going, goes, went), we use the verb 'be' before the main verb with an -ing form for actions happening right now. However, in this case, it would be more appropriate to say "buys" because there is no need to emphasize that she is doing it continuously or at this very moment.
0	The subject of the sentence "Kim and Terry" is plural, so the verb needs to be in its plural form as well. Therefore, the correct version would be "Kim and Terry are happy."
1	The sentence "Kim gave a dollar to Bobbie and a dime to Jean." is grammatically correct in standard American English. Each element of the sentence has a clear subject ("Kim"), verb ("gave"), and two objects ("Bobbie" and "Jean"). Additionally, the use of articles ("a") before each coin denomination accurately reflects that only one unit of each type of currency was given away. Overall, there are no spelling errors or awkward phrasings, making this an entirely valid sentence.
1	The sentence appears to be grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("this girl"), a verb ("will put"), an object ("a picture of Bill"), and two prepositional phrases indicating where the action takes place ("in the mailbox" and "on your desk"). Additionally, there is a time expression ("before tomorrow") that indicates when the action will occur. All these elements work together coherently to convey a complete thought with no apparent grammatical errors or awkward constructions.
1	The sentence appears to be grammatically correct. It consists of two independent clauses joined by the coordinating conjunction "and." Each clause has a clear subject ("this girl in the red coat" and "you") and predicate (the actions that each subject performs). Additionally, both clauses express an action that will take place before tomorrow, so they are logically consistent with one another. Overall, there do not appear to be any grammatical errors or logical inconsistencies in this sentence.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("this girl in the red coat"), a verb ("will put"), and an object ("a picture of Bill"). The phrase "on your desk before tomorrow" provides additional information about when and where the action will take place. Overall, the sentence conveys a clear meaning without any grammatical errors or awkward phrasing.
1	The sentence "Ann bought a first edition of Richard III for $1000" is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("Ann"), an object ("a first edition of Richard III"), and a verb ("bought") that links them together. Additionally, it includes a prepositional phrase ("for $1000") which modifies the verb. All in all, the sentence has a clear structure and meaning, making it a valid English sentence.
1	The sentence "John became deadly afraid of flying" is grammatically correct. Here, 'deadly' is used as an adverb to modify the adjective 'afraid', indicating a very high degree of fear. However, it can also be interpreted as meaning that John's fear of flying resulted in his death, which might not be the intended meaning. To avoid ambiguity, one could use 'extremely' or 'terribly' instead of 'deadly'. Nonetheless, without further context, I will assume that the sentence is conveying a high degree of fear and thus label it as grammatically correct.
1	The sentence "What John promised is to be gentle" is grammatically correct, but its meaning may not be what was intended. A more natural way to phrase this thought might be "John promised to be gentle." However, if the speaker intends for the emphasis to be on "what," as in "I'm curious about what John promised; specifically, that he would be gentle," then the original sentence could also work. In any case, there is no grammatical error in the sentence itself.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It is a question asking about the specific books related to cooking that Henri intends to purchase.
1	The sentence "I will fix the computer for Carol" is grammatically correct. Here's a breakdown of why it's correct: - "I": This is a pronoun that refers to the speaker. It's in the subject case and agrees with the verb "will fix." - "will fix": This is an auxiliary verb (also known as a helping verb) followed by the base form of the main verb "fix." In this context, "will" indicates future tense. - "the": This is a definite article that specifies which computer is being referred to. - "computer": This is a noun that represents a piece of electronic equipment used to perform calculations or tasks involving digital data. - "for": This is a preposition that shows relationship between two things. In this case, it indicates that the action of fixing the computer is being done on behalf of someone else. - "Carol": This is a proper noun representing a person's name. Overall, the sentence has a clear structure and each word plays a specific role in conveying its meaning. Therefore, it's grammatically correct.
1	The sentence "Smith loaned a valuable collection of manuscripts to the library" is grammatically correct. Here's why: - The subject of the sentence is "Smith," which is a proper noun and correctly capitalized. - The verb in the simple past tense is "loaned." This form of the verb agrees with the singular third-person subject "Smith." - The direct object is "a valuable collection of manuscripts," which provides more information about what was loaned by specifying its value and nature. - Finally, we have the preposition "to" followed by the indirect object "the library," indicating where the collection was loaned. Therefore, based on grammatical rules, I would assign it a score of 1 for being correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "the paper," which is being acted upon by the verb "is cut" and the agent performing the action is "Mary." So the structure of the sentence is (Subject) + (Verb) + (Agent), making it a proper English sentence.
1	The sentence "It was from six to nine or it took place from six to nine" is grammatically correct. Both clauses in the sentence are joined by the coordinating conjunction "or," which indicates a choice between two alternatives. Each clause contains the prepositional phrase "from six to nine," which functions as an adverbial of time, indicating when the event occurred. This structure creates a compound sentence that is clear and concise.
1	The sentence "Suddenly, there arrived two inspectors from the INS" is grammatically correct. The word "INS" is capitalized because it refers to a specific organization (the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service), so it functions as a proper noun in this context. Additionally, the verb tense used ("arrived") agrees with the subject of the sentence, which is "two inspectors." Therefore, I would classify this sentence as being grammatically correct.
0	This sentence is grammatically incorrect because it lacks a proper subject-verb agreement in its first clause. It should be either "The soup is cooking, thickening" or "The soup cooks and thickens." In English, when using the present simple tense with singular nouns (like "soup"), we use verbs that end in -s or -es; however, for plural subjects or uncountable nouns, we don't add an -s or -es to the verb. Here, since "the soup" is singular, the verb form of "cook" needs to have an -s ending. Additionally, connecting two actions performed by the same subject usually requires a conjunction such as 'and', so I added that into the corrected version above.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence, "I", is giving something (money) to someone (the charity), which follows standard English sentence structure.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It consists of a proper noun ("John") followed by an auxiliary verb ("asked"), which together form a complete thought. Therefore, it can be considered a valid simple sentence in English.
0	The sentence "I saw even the student" is grammatically incorrect because the word "even" in this context is unnecessary and does not add any meaning to the sentence. A more appropriate way to phrase it would be "I saw the student."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The word "whispered" indicates that John performed an action in the past, which implies that Mary leaving occurred after John whispering something. Therefore, it makes sense to say "Mary left" following "John whispered."
1	The sentence "Mary wonders that Bill will come" is grammatically correct in English. It shows that Mary is contemplating or speculating about whether Bill will arrive at some point in the future.
0	The sentence "Sophie will theater" is grammatically incorrect because it lacks a proper verb in its present tense form. A corrected version of this sentence could be "Sophie will go to the theater," or simply "Sophie will act."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of subject-verb agreement (John finished and drank), uses appropriate prepositions (finished the cake and drank the lemonade), and has a clear meaning. The actions performed by the subject, John, occur in a logical order that is easy to follow.
1	The sentence "Herself likes Mary's mother" is grammatically correct in English. Here, 'herself' refers to a female person who is speaking about herself, or someone is being referred to with feminine gender. So, if we consider that a woman is saying this sentence, it means she likes Mary's mother which makes perfect sense.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The phrase "each of the boys" refers to every individual boy in a group, and "some of the other boys" indicates that only a portion of the remaining boys were involved in fighting. Therefore, it implies that there was a conflict between different subgroups within the larger group of boys.
0	The pronoun used in this sentence does not agree with its antecedent (the word that it refers back to). The pronoun "himself" refers to a male person, but the antecedent "John's mother" is female. Therefore, the correct form of the pronoun should be "herself." A corrected version of the sentence would be: "John's mother likes herself."
0	The pronoun used in the sentence should match the gender of the person it refers to. In this case, 'himself' should be replaced with a feminine reflexive pronoun such as 'herself', since 'Mary' is female. Therefore, the corrected sentence would be "Mary revealed herself to John."
1	The sentence "Mary believes that Bill saw himself" is grammatically correct in English. Here's a breakdown of why it's correct: * "Mary" is the subject of the main clause, which is expressed as a belief held by Mary. * "believes" is the verb for the main clause, indicating what Mary does with respect to her belief. * "that" introduces a subordinate clause expressing what Mary believes. * "Bill" is the subject of the subordinate clause. * "saw" is the past tense of the verb "see," used here to indicate an action taken by Bill at some point in time. * "himself" is a reflexive pronoun referring back to "Bill." It indicates that Bill was both the subject (doer) and object (receiver) of the seeing action. Therefore, the overall structure of the sentence conveys that Mary holds a belief about something she has been told or observed concerning Bill's actions.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the main clause is "John", and the verb in the main clause is "heard". The dependent clause "that they criticized themselves" contains its own subject ("they") and verb ("criticized"). Both clauses are correctly constructed and follow each other without any grammatical errors.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence, "Mary," is clearly identified, and the verb tense is consistent throughout. Additionally, there is a subordinating conjunction ("that") which introduces a dependent clause, providing additional information about what Mary thinks. Overall, the structure of the sentence follows standard English grammar rules, so it can be labeled as correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence, "Henry," is doing an action (finding) to something (the state or condition of "Bill"). It uses a linking verb ("is") to connect "Bill" with his current emotional state, which is "sad."
1	The sentence "John considers himself proud of Mary" is grammatically correct. Here, "considers himself" is a reflexive verb phrase where "himself" refers back to the subject "John". It means that John has a positive opinion about himself in relation to Mary.
0	The correct phrase is "you should sit there before," not "before there." Before is used to refer to something that happens or comes first in time, place, order, etc., while 'there' refers to a location. So, it does not make sense to say 'sit before there'. Instead, one can say 'sit there before', which means to take a seat at that location prior to some event.
1	The sentence "There is a nurse available" is grammatically correct in standard English. It contains a subject ("a nurse"), an auxiliary verb ("is"), and a predicate adjective ("available"). The word order follows the rules of simple present tense declarative sentences (subject + auxiliary verb + predicate). Therefore, it can be understood easily by native speakers without any ambiguity or errors that would hinder communication.
0	The correct form of the second "everyone" in this sentence should be "they." A corrected version would read: "Everyone hopes they will sleep." Therefore, the original sentence is incorrect.
1	The sentence "Everyone hopes that he will sleep" is grammatically correct. The subject here is "everyone", which is a singular indefinite pronoun referring to all people in general. Although it might seem more natural to use 'they' instead of 'he', using 'he' as a gender-neutral singular pronoun has been used traditionally in formal English writing. Therefore, there isn't any grammatical error in this sentence.
0	This sentence is grammatically incorrect. The phrase "Churchill remembering Churchill giving" creates a recursive structure that doesn't make sense in English grammar. A corrected version could be: "Only Churchill recalled his own giving of the Blood, Sweat and Tears speech."
0	The verb "promise" requires a that-clause or an infinitive phrase as its complement. In this case, it's followed by a bare infinitive ("shave"), which is incorrect. It should be either "John promised Mary that he would shave himself" or "John promised Mary to shave himself." However, since there's no comma before "to," I assume the speaker intended to use the second option but made a mistake in writing or speaking it. So let me rephrase the corrected version for clarity: John promised Mary (to do something), specifically, to shave himself.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There is a subject ("John"), an action verb ("convinced") in past tense, a direct object ("Bill"), and an embedded clause indicating what John convinced Bill about ("that Mary should sleep"). All elements have clear roles and follow proper syntax rules.
0	The sentence "I saw Bill while you did so Mary" is grammatically incorrect. It seems that there was an attempt to use the conjunction "while" to connect two actions happening at the same time, but the structure of the sentence is confusing and unclear. A possible correction could be "I saw Bill while you talked to Mary" or "While I saw Bill, you did something."
0	The sentence has incorrect grammar because it uses the wrong verb tense for what Bill did. A more grammatically correct way to phrase the sentence would be "Mary, Bill gave a book to." or "Bill gave a book to Mary."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "the bears" which is plural, and the verb that follows it, "sniffed," is also in the past tense plural form, agreeing with the subject. There are no other issues with grammar or word usage in this sentence, so it is a complete and proper sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "to steal," which is a infinitive verb phrase acting as the subject. The direct object is "talisman(s)," which is the noun being acted upon by the verb. Finally, the prepositional phrase "from witches" describes where or who the action is being done to. Overall, the structure of the sentence is clear and easy to understand.
0	The sentence "Anson demonized" is grammatically incomplete because it lacks a direct object. A direct object is a noun or pronoun that receives the action of a verb. For example, in the sentence "John kicked the ball," "ball" is the direct object because it received the action of John's kick. Therefore, the sentence "Anson demonized" is not a complete thought and cannot be considered a grammatically correct sentence on its own.
0	The verb "kick" requires a singular object when used with the reflexive pronoun "yourselves." Therefore, the grammatically correct form of this sentence would be "you kicked yourself," unless there were multiple people present who all independently performed the action of kicking themselves, in which case it could also be expressed as "each of you kicked yourselves." However, without additional context indicating that such a situation was intended, we must assume the original sentence to be incorrect.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. Here's a breakdown of why: * "The book" is a noun phrase acting as the subject of the sentence. * "that I said" is a relative clause modifying the subject, indicating which specific book is being referred to. * "that I'd never read" is another relative clause modifying the subject, providing additional information about it (specifically, that the speaker had previously stated they would never read it). Overall, the structure of the sentence is clear and follows standard English grammar rules.
0	The sentence "Anson demonized up the Khyber" is grammatically incorrect. In English, we don't use the preposition "up" after a verb unless it's idiomatic (e.g., "pick up", "put up"). Additionally, "demonize" doesn't take a location as its object; rather, it refers to portraying someone or something negatively. Therefore, without context suggesting an unusual meaning for these words, this sentence appears nonsensical in standard English usage.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The phrase "it is not true that" negates the possibility of the speaker attending a party in the future, which is expressed using the modal verb "might." Additionally, the use of the continuous tense ("going") instead of the simple present tense ("go") correctly conveys an action that has yet to occur.
0	The sentence "Kick you!" is grammatically incorrect because it lacks a subject. A complete sentence requires both a subject and a verb, but in this case, there is only an action (verb) without anyone performing that action. It would be more proper to say "Someone kicks you" or "He/She kicks you."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The verb "persuaded" takes a direct object ("the doctor") and an infinitive phrase ("to treat Medea"), which indicates the action that the direct object is being persuaded to take. There is no ambiguity in the meaning of the sentence, as it is clear that Jason is doing the persuading, the doctor is the one being persuaded, and Medea is the person who will be treated.
0	The sentence is incomplete and grammatically incorrect. It asks a question but does not specify who or what the subject is that the action was done to. A complete version could be "Who did you give an accurate description of?" or "Of whom did you get an accurate description?"
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "The" is a definite article that introduces a noun phrase. In this case, it refers to a specific person named Peter who is known to everyone mentioned in the sentence ("we all"). * "Peter" is the subject of the sentence. It is a proper noun that has been capitalized correctly. * "we" is a first-person plural pronoun that refers to multiple people, including the speaker. * "all" is an adverb that modifies the verb "like." It indicates that every member of the group referred to by "we" shares the same positive feeling toward Peter. * "like" is a transitive verb that takes the preposition "was" as its complementizer. It means to have a fondness or affection for someone or something. * "was" is a past tense form of the linking verb "to be," which connects the subject of the sentence (Peter) with additional information about him (he was present at the party). * "at" is a preposition that shows location or position in time or space. In this case, it indicates where Peter was during the event described in the sentence. * "the party" is a noun phrase that functions as the object of the preposition "at." It consists of the definite article "the" followed by the common noun "party," indicating a social gathering that both Peter and the speakers attended.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. Here, 'the government' is a singular noun that is modified by a possessive adjective 'government's'. Then we have the verb 'imposes', which agrees with its subject in number (singular). Finally, there is the object of the sentence 'a fine'. Overall, it follows the standard structure of Subject-Verb-Object, making it grammatically sound.
1	Yes, the sentence "Did Athena help us?" is grammatically correct. It is a question asking whether or not the entity named Athena provided assistance to "us". The word order is correct, there are no missing words or misspellings, and all of the punctuation is appropriate for the sentence type (interrogative).
1	The sentence "You wanted to meet the man I saw" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "you", which is in second person singular or plural form. The verb "wanted" is the past tense of "want" and agrees with the subject "you". The infinitive phrase "to meet" functions as the main verb of the sentence. The object of the sentence is "the man", which is preceded by the determiner "the". Finally, the relative clause "I saw" modifies "the man". Therefore, the sentence is a complete and coherent thought expressed in proper grammatical structure.
1	The sentence "Anson demonized David every day" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "Anson" is a proper noun that refers to a person's name, so it is correctly used as the subject of the sentence. * "demonized" is the past tense of the verb "demonize," which means to portray someone or something as evil. It agrees with the subject in number (singular) and matches the required form for a transitive verb taking a direct object. * "David" is also a proper noun referring to another person's name, serving as the direct object of the sentence. * "every day" modifies the verb phrase "demonized David," indicating how often the action occurred. This expression is grammatically correct when used in this way.
0	The word "programme" in British English can sometimes be spelled as "program," but to maintain consistency with standard American English usage, it's better to use "program." However, that's not the main issue here. The problem lies in the question formulation itself. A more grammatically correct way of asking would be: "Is there a program about Euripides on Radio 4 tonight?" or "Will there be a program about Euripides on Radio 4 tonight?"
1	The sentence "Medea denied poisoning the phoenix" is grammatically correct in English. It contains a subject ("Medea"), an auxiliary verb ("denied"), a direct object ("poisoning the phoenix") and follows standard English syntax rules. There are no spelling or punctuation errors, making it a valid English sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence ("the elixir") is singular, so the verb must also be singular. In this case, the verb "was" correctly matches the subject. Additionally, all other elements of the sentence, including the prepositional phrase "in a hole in the ground," are arranged properly.
0	The adverb "Extremely" is redundant with "frantically," which already conveys a high degree of intensity. Also, there's no verb in the phrase "Trade." It could be corrected to something like "Anson danced frantically at the trade show."
0	The sentence "What did you ask who Medea gave?" is grammatically incorrect because it contains too many question words ("what" and "who") without proper context or structure. A more appropriate way to phrase this question could be "Who did Medea give that to?" or "What did Medea give as a gift?" depending on what information is being sought after.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Anson" and the verb is "like". The word "that" is a relative pronoun introducing a clause modifying the subject.
0	The sentence "Medea tried the nurse to poison her children" is grammatically incorrect. A correct version of this sentence could be "Medea asked the nurse to poison her children" or "Medea attempted to have the nurse poison her children." In both cases, a preposition such as 'to' or 'by' should be used after 'tried.'
0	The verb tense in this sentence is incorrect. It should be either "I felt that I knew you" or "I feel that I know you". In the first option, past perfect tense ("felt") is used to indicate that the knowing occurred before some other past action (which isn't mentioned here). In the second option, present tense ("feel") is used because the knowing continues up until now.
0	The auxiliary verb "will" is used to indicate future tense in English, but combining it with another auxiliary verb such as "can" results in an incorrect grammatical structure. A correct way to phrase the question would be "Will he be able to do it?" or "Can he do it?" instead of using both together.
0	The sentence "I ate that she was happy" is grammatically incorrect because it lacks a main verb in its first clause ("I ate") to connect with the second clause ("she was happy"). To make the sentence grammatical, one possible correction would be to replace "that" with "and", resulting in "I ate and she was happy". Alternatively, if the intended meaning of the original sentence is to say something about having observed or known about her happiness, then another option could be to rephrase it as "I found out that she was happy."
1	The sentence "Anson believed himself to be handsome" is grammatically correct. In this sentence, the verb "believed" is in past tense, which agrees with its subject "Anson." Additionally, the reflexive pronoun "himself" correctly refers back to the subject of the sentence, indicating that Anson has a belief about himself.
1	The sentence "We arrived about six o'clock" is grammatically correct. In this sentence, "about" is used as an adverb to indicate approximately, and it modifies the time expression "six o'clock." It indicates that the speaker and their group arrived around 6 PM (or AM) but not exactly at that time. Therefore, the use of "about" in this context is appropriate and makes sense in standard English usage.
0	The past simple tense ("fought") should be used consistently in the sentence if the action happened in the past. A better version would be "Gilgamesh fought the dragon" or "Gilgamesh has fought the dragon" (present perfect) if the fight has relevance to the present moment.
0	The reflexive pronoun "himself" is incorrect in this context because it refers back to the subject of the sentence, which is already mentioned as "Anson." Therefore, we need to use a regular personal pronoun instead of a reflexive one. A correct version would be "Anson thought that he was happy."
1	The sentence "Fortunately Hermione passed biology" is grammatically correct. It consists of a subordinating conjunction ("fortunately") that introduces an adverbial clause modifying the main clause ("Hermione passed biology"). Both clauses contain a subject and a predicate verb, making the overall structure of the sentence clear and coherent.
1	The sentence "I might be not going to the party but washing my hair" is grammatically correct. It contains two independent clauses ("I might be not going to the party" and "washing my hair") connected by a coordinating conjunction ("but"). Each clause has a subject and a verb, which is all that's required for a sentence to be grammatical. Additionally, the use of the auxiliary verb "might" in the first clause correctly conveys uncertainty about whether or not the speaker will attend the party.
0	The verb "thought" requires an object form of the pronoun to follow it, rather than a reflexive one. Therefore, instead of saying "he liked myself", the grammatically correct version would be "he liked me". So, in total: "I thought he liked me."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in English. It consists of a subject ("the butler"), an action verb ("sent"), and an object ("the poison to Dinah"). There are no spelling or punctuation errors, and the word order follows standard English syntax rules.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct, although it is quite long and convoluted. The word "happens" indicates that Jason's appearing sick is unexpected or a coincidence, while "seem" suggests that he looks sick but may not actually be ill. Overall, the sentence implies that Jason gives the appearance of being unwell, even if he isn't really.
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect because it contains a misplaced question word ("who"). A more appropriate way to phrase the sentence would be "Who did you ask what they saw?" or "What did you ask the person who saw (something)?" In its current form, the sentence does not make logical sense as written in English.
1	The sentence "We linguists love to argue" is grammatically correct. "We" is a plural subject pronoun that agrees with its plural noun, "linguists." The verb "love" is used correctly as an intransitive verb taking the subject complement "to argue," which indicates what the subjects (we linguists) love to do. Overall, there are no grammatical errors or awkward phrasings, so I would rate this sentence as grammatically correct and assign it a score of 1.
0	The sentence "He can will go" is grammatically incorrect because it contains two modal verbs ("can" and "will") in a row, which is not allowed in standard English. A more appropriate way to phrase this idea would be "He can go" or "He will go."
0	The sentence "How fierce the battle?" is grammatically incomplete because it lacks a proper question word to begin the sentence such as "how" or "how fiercely." A correct version of the sentence would be "How fierce was the battle?" or "How fiercely did they fight in the battle?"
0	The sentence "Which king did you ask which city invaded?" is grammatically incorrect because it contains two question words ("which king" and "which city") without proper verb agreement in each clause. To make it a coherent question, we can revise it as follows: "Which king did you ask (about) the city that was invaded by him?" or "Which city did you ask (about) the king who invaded it?"
0	The sentence contains a grammatical error and an awkward phrasing. A more appropriate way to phrase it would be: "Those ditches contain some disgruntled old pigs, which are loved by humans to eat." However, even with proper rephrasing, the content of the sentence remains problematic as promoting cannibalism is generally considered unacceptable.
0	In the given sentence, a banana is described as eating a monkey which is incorrect because only living beings can eat food items, not objects or non-living things. Therefore, it's necessary to reverse the roles of the subject and object in the sentence for it to be grammatically correct. The corrected version would be - "The monkey is eating that banana."
1	The sentence "Burn them!" is grammatically correct in the context of giving a command to someone. However, it may be missing some context for a complete understanding of its meaning.
0	The statement "It stinks that Aphrodite is omnipotent" is grammatically correct but factually incorrect. In Greek mythology, Aphrodite is the goddess of love, beauty, pleasure, and procreation, not the all-powerful deity who possesses unlimited power and authority over everything, which is what "omnipotent" means. Therefore, it's inaccurate to describe Aphrodite as omnipotent.
1	The sentence "Agamemnon seems to be a maniac" is grammatically correct. Here, "Agamemnon" is the subject, "seems" is the linking verb, and "to be a maniac" describes the state or condition of the subject. Therefore, there's no grammatical error in this sentence.
1	The sentence "Will Anson come to the party?" is grammatically correct. It forms a complete question with a subject ("Anson") and an auxiliary verb ("will") followed by the base form of the main verb ("come"). The predicate of the sentence is "come to the party". There are no spelling or punctuation errors in this sentence that would make it incorrect.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject ("I") is followed by a verb in past tense ("wondered"), and an interrogative pronoun ("who") introducing a question about someone or something that has been previously mentioned (Medea). There is also a clear object of the verb ("who Medea had poisoned"). Therefore, there is no need for improvement to make it more natural as native speakers would say it.
1	The sentence "I inquired when could we leave" is grammatically correct. Although it might sound a bit formal or stilted in everyday conversation, there's nothing inherently wrong with its structure. Here, "inquire" means to ask about something, typically in an official or careful way. So, the speaker asked when they would be able to depart.
0	The sentence is incomplete as it lacks a clear object being acted upon by the verb "kicked". It's unclear who or what was kicked. A complete and grammatically correct version of this sentence could be something like "They kicked the ball."
0	In present tense, the verb 'eat' requires the third person singular form (i.e., 'eats') when referring to a subject that is he, she or it. Here, the subject of the sentence is 'the monkey', which is a single entity, so we need to use 'eats'. Hence, the correct version would be "The monkey eats the banana."
0	The sentence "I would like to could swim" is grammatically incorrect. A correct version of this sentence could be "I would like to be able to swim" or "I would like to be able to swimm." In this corrected form, it can be seen that "could" is unnecessary as "be able to" already conveys the idea of ability.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The verb "kicked" is in past tense, which agrees with the subject "I". Additionally, the reflexive pronoun "myself" correctly refers back to the subject of the sentence.
0	This sentence is incorrect because inanimate objects such as a bookcase cannot run; only animate beings or things can run. For a sentence to be grammatically correct, it must have both grammatical and semantic accuracy.
1	The sentence "I shaved myself" is grammatically correct in English because it follows the standard subject-verb-object (SVO) structure where "I" is the subject, "shaved" is the verb, and "myself" is an reflexive pronoun that refers back to the subject. Reflexive pronouns indicate that the action of a verb was performed by, upon, or for the benefit of the subject itself. Therefore, there is no grammatical error in this sentence.
0	The sentence "Anson became a muscle bound" is grammatically incorrect. The phrase "muscle bound" is an adjective that describes someone who has large muscles but lacks flexibility. Therefore, it cannot be used as a noun to describe what Anson became. A possible correction could be "Anson became muscular."
