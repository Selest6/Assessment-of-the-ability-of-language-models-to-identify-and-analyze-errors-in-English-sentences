1	Syntax	The ropes made the weight stretch over the pulley. Explanation: In the original sentence, it says 'the weights made the rope stretch', but this implies that the weights have some sort of agency, as if they are actively doing something. A more appropriate way to phrase this would be 'the rope stretched under the weight'. However, I noticed a mistake in the relationship between the objects in your sentence. You said 'weights' instead of 'weight', but since we don't know how many there are, I assumed that you meant only one weight. Therefore, I changed the order of the words so that it makes sense grammatically while preserving the intended meaning.
0	Syntax	The mechanical doll managed to wriggle itself loose.
1	Syntax	The sentence is already correct.
0	Semantics	The sentence is not correct. It should be: "Since you eat the most, you want the least."
0	Semantics	The more you want to eat, the less you will want to eat later. Explanation: The original sentence implies a contradiction because wanting more food does not typically lead to eating less. Instead, it could result in overeating, so a better way to express this idea is by acknowledging the desire to eat less after initially desiring more.
0	Syntax	The sentence should be "The more John eats, the more he has to pay." Instead, it says "The more John eat, the more he pays," which is grammatically incorrect.
0	Syntax	You might want to connect the two clauses with a conjunction such as 'and' for better clarity. Here's the corrected version: "Mary listens to the Grateful Dead AND she gets depressed." However, if you intended to imply a cause-effect relationship between the two actions, consider using more explicit phrasing, e.g., "Mary listens to the Grateful Dead, and it makes her feel depressed." The original sentence may lead to ambiguity in meaning without additional context.
1	Other Category	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The higher the stakes, the lower his expectation is. Explanation: In this case, the singular form of the noun ("expectation") should be used instead of the plural form ("expectations"), since it refers to a single person's lowered expectations in high-stakes situations.
1	Syntax	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The correct sentence should be "John was much more obnoxious than Fred" instead of using "lots more".

1	Syntax	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence is already correct. Explanation: The original sentence "Every senator seems to become more corrupt, as he talks to more lobbyists" is grammatically correct in terms of syntax, semantics, morphology, and other linguistic aspects. Therefore, no correction is required for this sentence.
0	Syntax	The corrected sentence should be: "John visits Sally because he likes her." The original sentence lacks a direct object for the verb "likes," making it incomplete and grammatically incorrect.
1	Syntax	The sentence is already correct.
0	Other Category	The sentence is already correct. This structure can indicate a variety of meanings depending on context, including past ability, an assumption about something in the past, or frustration with someone's actions in the past.

1	Syntax	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence should be "Mickey looked up at it.", so the corrected sentence is: Mickey looked up at it. Explanation: In order for the sentence to have proper syntax, we need to include a preposition such as 'at' after looking up, indicating what direction Mickey is looking in.
0	Other Category	There tends to be a lot of discussion. Explanation: The verb in this sentence needs to agree with its subject in number. Since "there" is singular, we need to use the third person present tense form of the verb "to tend," which is "tends."

0	Syntax	The tank leaked the fluid freely.

1	Syntax	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence is almost correct, but it would be clearer if it said "Most people probably consider Klaus guilty of murder, even though the courts did not actually find him so." This changes the word order slightly for clarity.
1	Other Category	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically incorrect as it stands. A more appropriate way to word it would be: "Clearly, John will probably learn French immediately and perfectly." This version preserves the intended meaning while following proper syntax rules for English sentences.
0	Syntax	The sentence should be "Sue gave Bill a book" instead of "Sue gave to Bill a book". In English, we usually say "give something to someone", so the preposition "to" should come after the indirect object "Bill".
1	Syntax	The sentence is already correct.
0	Other Category	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence should be structured as "They represented [someone] as a [description] to [recipient]", so it should read: "They represented Mary as a serious linguist to the dean."

1	Syntax	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence should be "I can't believe Fred won't either." with a coordinating conjunction "either" linking two negative ideas.
0	Syntax	The sentence should be: "John wants to read Fred's story, and I do too." The original sentence lacks a proper way to express agreement with the first clause, making it grammatically incorrect.
0	Syntax	The corrected sentence should be: "We wanted to invite someone, but we couldn't decide who to invite." The original sentence lacks an infinitive verb after "who," making it grammatically incorrect.
1	Other Category	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The corrected sentence should be: "Mary claimed that Holly shouldn't eat cabbage."
0	Syntax	The sentence should be "Mary came to be introduced by the bartender, and I did too." Instead, the original sentence incorrectly uses "came to be" again instead of a more appropriate phrase such as "did too".
1	Other Category	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence "Joe's neuroses bother his patrons, and Sally does too" would be grammatically correct if it were written as "Joe's neuroses bother his patrons, and so does Sally." This way, both subjects and verbs agree in number.
0	Semantics	The sentence is almost correct but can be improved for clarity. Consider saying "I know which book Jos√© didn't read for class, and which book Lilly read for him instead" to make the meaning clearer.
0	Syntax	The sentence should be: "This is the book which Bob reviewed, and this is the one that Fred won't do."
0	Syntax	The corrected sentence is "I know which book Mag read and which book Bob said you hadn't." Explanation: In your original sentence, there was an extra comma after 'read'. Commas cannot be used as a separator between two independent clauses without using any conjunction such as 'and', 'or', etc. Also, it would make more sense if we use the pronoun 'you' instead of 'you hadn't' in the second clause for better understanding.
0	Syntax	The corrected sentence would be: "I know which book Mag read and which book Bob read your report that you hadn't." Explanation: In the original sentence, 'my report' refers to the speaker's report, but it follows 'Bob read', making it unclear whose report is being referred to. To avoid confusion, replace 'my report' with 'your report'.
1	Other Category	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The corrected sentence should be: "Rusty talked about himself only after Mary had talked about him." The original sentence incorrectly uses the past tense verb form "did talk" for both clauses instead of using "talked" for the first clause and "had talked" for the second clause to indicate the sequence of events correctly.
0	Syntax	The corrected sentence should be "Fred talked about everything before Rusty did **talk** about anything." The repetition of 'talk' in the original sentence makes it grammatically incorrect.
1	Other Category	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The problem is easy to perceive. Explanation: In English, it's more common to say "is easy to perceive" rather than "perceives easily". Additionally, in the original sentence, there is a missing article before the word "problem", making the corrected version read as "The problem is easy to perceive."
1	Other Category	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence should be "We elected him" if referring to a male candidate, or "We elected her" if referring to a female candidate. The use of first person singular pronoun ("me") as the object of an action performed by the first person plural subject ("we") is grammatically incorrect in standard English.
0	Syntax	He submitted a report stating that John was incompetent. In the original sentence, there is no indication of who submitted the report about John's incompetence. The corrected sentence clarifies this by including "he" as the subject and specifying what kind of report it was.
1	Other Category	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence should be "He let the cats that were whining out" or "He let the cats who were whining out." The word "which" would typically introduce a restrictive clause in written English, but it can't follow a preposition such as "of," "with," or "for." Instead, use "that" or "who" after a preposition. However, many people ignore this rule in colloquial speech. Here, I will assume formal written English rules apply. So, the corrected sentence using standard English syntax is: "He let the cats that were whining out" or "He let the cats who were whining out."
0	Other Category	You could say "What did Bill buy?" if you want to ask about a past action. However, if you want to make a statement about what Bill bought, it would be more appropriate to say "Bill bought something." The original sentence does not specify what Bill bought, so I will assume the correct form is: "Bill bought something." In this case, since the corrected sentence is provided, there is no need to state that the original sentence is already correct.
1	Other Category	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	A proof that the claim had been made was provided because John had lied.
0	Syntax	The fire, which destroyed most of my factory, was caused by an overloaded transducer and can be attributed to a short circuit. Explanation: In the original sentence, it is unclear what exactly was attributed to the short circuit because there is no main verb linking "attributed" with its subject and object. It's better to separate the two clauses for clarity, as shown in the corrected version.
0	Syntax	The mayor regarded as absurd the proposal to build a sidewalk from Dartmouth to Smith.
0	Syntax	The fact that Bill left should remain a secret.
0	Syntax	The sentence should be: "I know a man whom Tom drives" or "I know a man who drives".
0	Syntax	Drowning cats, which is against the law, are difficult to rescue. Explanation: The word "hard" should be replaced with "difficult" since it agrees in number with its plural subject "cats".
1	Syntax	The sentence is already correct.
0	Semantics	The sentence should be "Rutherford understands himself" instead of "Himself is understood by Rutherford".
1	Other Category	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The proof that this set is recursive is difficult. In your original sentence, there seems to be a missing word "that" after "proof". Including it makes the sentence grammatically correct.
0	Syntax	The madrigals that Henry plays the lute and sings sound loud. Explanation: In the original sentence, there is a mix-up in subject-verb agreement as well as an incorrect use of the word "lousy". In my corrected version, I changed "which" to "that", since "that" is more commonly used when introducing a restrictive clause. Additionally, I replaced "sound lousy" with "sound loud", because it's unlikely for someone to describe music they enjoy negatively unless they dislike it. However, without context it's difficult to be sure if these changes make the sentence grammatically perfect.
1	Syntax	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	Please provide two separate questions, each with a subject and verb. For example: "Where did you go?" and "What did who eat?"
0	Syntax	Whose boy'sdid we elect as the guardian's employer's president? Explanation: The original sentence has a mistake in its word order and use of possessive forms. A corrected version could be "Whose boy's did we elect as the guardian's employer's president?"
0	Semantics	A more appropriate way to ask this question would be "How sanely does Peter behave?" or "What is Peter's state of mental health?" The original sentence is grammatically correct but may sound awkward in formal contexts because it uses an adjective ("sane") with a possessive form ("Peter's"). It might imply questioning Peter's character rather than his behavior or psychological condition.
0	Syntax	The sentence is almost correct, but it would be better to say "my dad lives at a place where Route 150 crosses the Hudson River as well" instead of "too".
0	Syntax	The sentence should be "My dad lives there as well" instead of "my dad lives at it too". So the corrected sentence is: "I live at the place where Route 150 crosses the Hudson River and my dad lives there as well."
0	Syntax	You might be asking, "Who is she trying to make up with now?" The original sentence contains a spelling mistake where 'to' should have been written as 'with'.
0	Syntax	The wind was blown off a plot to negotiate an honorable end to the war in Vietnam. Explanation: The original sentence contains a verb mistake. The word 'gotten' is incorrect in this context; it should be replaced with 'blown'. A better way to construct this sentence would be as follows: "The wind blew away from a plot to negotiate an honorable end to the war in Vietnam."
1	Syntax	The sentence should be structured as "Mike talked about politics to my friends yesterday" since the object of discussion should come before those who it was discussed with. ```makefile Sentence: Mike talked about politics to my friends yesterday Is_correct: 1 Label: 1 Category: Syntax Correct_sentence: The sentence is already correct. ```
1	Syntax	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence is incorrect as it stands. A more grammatically correct version could be: "Which hat did Mike say she never wore?" or "Mike quipped that she never wore a certain hat; can you guess which one?" It's important to note that 'quip' means to make a clever remark, so using 'that' instead of 'who' or 'which' might sound better in some contexts. However, if referring specifically to an item (like a hat), then 'which' would generally be used for clarity.
0	Syntax	Which girl did Mike quip never wore *that* hat? In this case, there's a pronoun reference error in the original sentence where 'this' refers to something that isn't specified clearly within the context provided. The corrected sentence uses 'that' instead, assuming it points to an object outside of the immediate context.
1	Other Category	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence should be "I won't have any money" instead of "I won't have some money".
0	The category in this case is Semantics because it has to do with meaning and making sense of a statement.	I am unsure whether the specific situation is true or false; however, grammatically there is no issue with the sentence structure itself. So the corrected version would be: "Do you believe the claim that someone was looking for something?"
0	Syntax	I cannot ask you to believe that he tried to force me to give her any money. Explanation: The original sentence incorrectly uses "won't" instead of "can't," as it conveys a request for permission rather than an inability to perform the action.
0	Semantics	The sentence seems grammatically correct, but its meaning is unclear due to ambiguity in reference of the pronoun 'he'. It would be better if rewritten with specific subject for clarity. For example - "That John sometimes didn't sleep must have pleased somebody".
0	Semantics	The sentence should be "I talked to Winston about him." if the intended meaning is that the speaker discussed Winston with someone else. Alternatively, if the intended meaning is that the speaker discussed something related to Winston's own thoughts or feelings, then a better way to express it would be "I talked to Winston about his own self."
0	Syntax	The fuzz worried John because it wanted him, but it didn't worry Mary because it didn't want her.
0	Syntax	I'll work on it if Sam works on it. Explanation: The verb in the second clause should match with the subject 'Sam', so the present tense form 'will be working' should be changed to simple present tense 'works'.
0	Other Category	I will work on it if I am able to. Explanation: The word 'can' in your original sentence indicates a possibility, while 'will' implies certainty. Using both together creates an inconsistency as they convey different levels of commitment towards performing the action. Instead, you could use either 'I'll try to work on it' or 'I will work on it', depending on how definite you want to be about helping out.
0	Syntax	Here's a knife for you to cut up the onions with. Explanation: In English, we typically say "Here's X for Y" instead of "Here's Y with X". Additionally, prepositions such as "with" usually come at the end of the sentence rather than in the middle when used in this context.
0	Syntax	The sentence should be "Fluffy is sick, which not everyone knows." instead of "Fluffy is sick, which not everybody knows".
0	Semantics	The sentence should be "Maxwell is quite a good doctor" if we want to express that he is skilled. Or it could be "Maxwell is a very interesting doctor" if we want to say that his personality is intriguing. The original sentence implies that Maxwell is somewhat ill or unhealthy, as 'quite' can mean 'somewhat unwell'.
0	Syntax	The corrected sentence would be: "The younger woman might have been tall and the older one definitely was blond." The original sentence had an extra "and" before "the older one".
0	Syntax	The corrected sentence is: "Sally is tall and may be blond, and Sheila is short and definitely is blonde." The original sentence contained a morphological error with the word 'blond' being used instead of 'blonde'. However, I am returning 'Syntax' as my category because there was also a syntactical issue in the formatting of multiple independent clauses joined by conjunctions ('and'). Each clause needs to have its own verb-subject agreement, so it needed to be changed from 'is' to 'is blonde.'
0	Other Category	You need to try to finish grading some papers. Explanation: The original sentence lacks a subject-auxiliary inversion required for an imperative construction with "have to" followed by a base form verb ("try"). Adding a pronoun subject such as "you" makes the sentence grammatically correct.
0	Syntax	The socks are ready for you to put on and be planned. (Note: This revised sentence still has a semantic issue because being "planned" doesn't apply to socks.)
1	Other Category	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence is already correct. This violin is difficult to play sonatas on.
0	Syntax	The sentence should be "My mother is easy to please, and she also pleases my father." or "My mother is easy to please; she also pleases my father.", as there needs to be a conjunction or punctuation connecting the two independent clauses.
0	Syntax	The sentence should be "Poor Bill, it had started to rain and he didn't have an umbrella." instead of "Poor Bill, it had started to rain and he had no umbrella." The reason for this correction is that we use "didn't have" rather than "had no" when using a past tense verb before the subject in a negative statement.
0	Syntax	That the cops spoke to the janitor about the robbery yesterday is terrible.
0	Syntax	Every student who wears socks is a swinger.
1	Other Category	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence is already correct. The negation "no" would be more appropriate than "nobody" in this context, but the sentence is grammatically correct as it stands.
0	Syntax	The sentence is already correct.
0	Semantics	I can't remember the name of someone who had misgivings. Explanation: The word 'somebody' should be replaced with 'someone' for grammatical correctness in formal writing.
0	Syntax	At least one coordinated subject ("no writer" and "no playwright") needs to be in plural form to agree with the plural verb "meet". Here's a corrected version: "No writers and no playwrights meet in Vienna."
0	Syntax	Either "No writer meets in Vienna" or "Neither a writer nor a playwright meets in Vienna". The original sentence has incorrect subject-verb agreement due to the use of both singular ("writer") and plural nouns ("playwrights") with a singular verb form ("meets").
0	Semantics	It is not certain that you will marry any student. Explanation: The original sentence implies that someone else is uncertain about whether "you" will marry any student, but the intended meaning seems to be that it's uncertain whether "you" yourself will do the marrying. Therefore, we need a pronoun clarifying who is doing the action in question.
0	Other Category	The sentence "Felicia kicked the ball off the bench" would be more appropriate if the context was clear that the action of kicking the ball resulted in it moving away from the bench. Otherwise, the preposition "off" might not make logical sense here. A better option could be "Felicia kicked the ball on the bench," assuming she kicked it while sitting on the bench.
1	Other Category	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence "Sam gave the ball out of the basket" is grammatically correct, but it can be semantically improved for clarity. A more precise way to express this idea might be "Sam passed the ball out from the basket," depending on the intended meaning.
1	Other Category	The sentence is already correct.
1	Other Category	The sentence is already correct.
1	Other Category	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	Someone cannot forgive that comment to you. Explanation: The subject-verb agreement in the sentence is incorrect. In this case, "no one" is a singular noun, so it requires a singular verb form such as "can". Therefore, changing "No one can" to "Someone cannot" will make the sentence grammatically correct.
1	Other Category	The sentence is already correct.

0	Semantics	The sentence implies that Martha carved a toy for a baby out of wood, but it would be inappropriate to carve something out of a living baby. A more appropriate way to phrase the sentence could be: "Martha carved a toy made of wood for the baby."
0	Semantics	The knife cuts the bread easily.

0	Syntax	Paperback books can be lifted onto the table easily. The original sentence has a problem with subject-verb agreement; the plural noun "books" does not agree with the singular verb form "lifts".
0	Syntax	The books were lifted onto the table. Explanation: In present tense, we need an auxiliary verb ("were") for passive voice in this sentence structure.
0	Semantics	The sentence "Jessica loaded boxes under the wagon." is semantically incorrect as it implies that the boxes were loaded underneath the wagon rather than onto it. A more appropriate way to express this idea would be "Jessica loaded boxes onto the wagon."

0	Other Category	The flyers differ. Explanation: A more concise version of the original sentence can be used since both objects being compared are flyers.
0	Syntax	The corrected sentence should be: "This flyer and that flyer differ in some respects." The original sentence contains a preposition error; instead of using "apart," it would be grammatically correct to use a phrase such as "in some respects" after "differ."
0	Semantics	A jeweler typically signs a contract with their signature rather than writing it with their name. Therefore, a more appropriate sentence might be: "The jeweler signed the contract with his signature."

0	Syntax	The correct sentence should be "Linda smiled/wiggled her lip" instead of "Linda winked her lip". Winking cannot be done with lips; it's an action performed by eyes. Hence, the corrected sentence would require a more appropriate verb such as 'smiled' or 'wiggled'.
0	Syntax	The sentence should be "My heart is pounding" instead of "My heart is pounding me". The verb "pounding" in present participle form does not take a direct object.

1	Other Category	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	A little white rabbit jumped out of the box. The original sentence incorrectly places "out of" before the subject "a little white rabbit". It should be after the verb "jumped", so the corrected version is "A little white rabbit jumped out of the box."

1	Other Category	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	Much information was provided. Explanation: The word 'many' should be replaced with 'much' because we use much for uncountable nouns such as information, while many is used for countable nouns.
0	Syntax	The sentence should be "John offers much advice" or "John offers a lot of advice". The word "many" cannot modify the singular noun "advice".
1	Syntax	The sentence is already correct.

0	Syntax	The correct sentence should be "Wash **you**!" with the subject-auxiliary inversion for a question, making it "Wash you?" instead. Alternatively, if it's an imperative form, then just "Wash yourself" would work as well.
0	Syntax	The sentence should be "They have no information" or something similar that completes the prepositional phrase.
0	Syntax	Some of my jobs are in jeopardy. Explanation: In English, we use the phrase "some of" instead of just "some" when referring to a subset of a group. Therefore, the corrected sentence uses "some of" before "my jobs".
0	Syntax	The correct sentence should be: "It was the policeman who met several young students in the park last night." The word "that" is incorrect here because it indicates a restrictive relative clause, while we need a non-restrictive relative clause indicating additional information about the subject ("the policeman").
0	Syntax	The corrected sentence is: "Did the policeman meet someone in the park?" This question requires a direct object for the verb "meet".

0	Semantics	The sentence is unclear as it stands. It could be made clearer by adding more context or information. For example: "I don't know if I should agree with your decision" or "I am unsure whether to accept the proposal."

0	Syntax	A good friend has remained with me, thanks to him. Explanation: In your original sentence, "is remained" is incorrect because it violates subject-verb agreement rules in English. The verb "remain" needs a singular subject when used in the present tense. Therefore, we use "has remained" instead of "is remained". Also, I changed "to me" into "with me", as remaining with someone sounds more natural than remaining to them.

0	Other Category	The sentence is already correct. Explanation: The sentence "It bothers me that John coughs" is grammatically correct in terms of syntax and morphology. However, it may not be semantically appropriate depending on the context. For example, if someone is talking about John's smoking habit, then saying "it bothers me that John coughs" could imply judgment or criticism towards John. Therefore, I categorized it under "Other Category". But overall, the sentence itself does not contain any grammatical errors.
0	Syntax	It's easy to please John.
1	Other Category	The sentence is already correct.
0	Other Category	The fact that we invaded Iraq really bites. Explanation: The original sentence suggests that "we" bit Iraq, which does not make logical sense. A more appropriate way to express disapproval for an action would be to say something like "The fact that we invaded Iraq really bites," indicating that the consequences of the invasion are unpleasant.
0	Syntax	The sentence is already correct. Explanation: The original sentence is grammatically correct but depends on context for its intended meaning. For example, if it means that the speaker is annoyed by the constant barking of their dog named Fido, then there's no need to change anything in the sentence. However, if the speaker wants to express that they are annoyed with someone else because of Fido's barking, a different word order might be more appropriate, such as "It annoys me that you are bothered by Fido's barking" or something similar.

0	Syntax	The author who has contributed in any language other than English will provide an english summary. Explanation: In the original sentence, there is no need for the word "whose" because we can use "who" instead and move it before "any language". Additionally, I have corrected the spelling of "english" to ensure proper capitalization according to English grammar rules.
0	Syntax	The sentence should be "I'm sure we have even gotten these tickets!" instead of "I'm sure we even got these tickets!" because "have" should be used with "even" in present perfect tense.
0	Syntax	The sentence should be "I'm not even sure if we have these tickets!" instead of "I'm even sure we got these tickets!". The word "not" needs to be added before "even", and a question mark at the end would make it grammatically correct as well.
0	Syntax	The sentence is already correct. Explanation: The sentence is grammatically correct but can be improved for clarity. Consider changing "urban guerrillas" to simply "guerrillas," as it does not seem relevant to the meaning of the sentence in this context.

0	Other Category	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	I gave Mary a book after the party. Explanation: The original sentence has incorrect word order according to English grammar rules for statement sentences. In English, we usually follow the Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) structure in simple statements. Here's how it looks step by step: Subject: I Verb: gave Object: a book Adverbial Phrase: after the party So putting everything together gives us the corrected version: I gave Mary a book after the party.
0	Syntax	The sentence should be "As for Mary, I really like her because she's so pleasant." The clause "because she's so pleasant" provides a reason for why the speaker likes Mary, so it needs to come after the statement about liking Mary in order to maintain logical flow.
1	Syntax	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	With a job, John would be happy. Explanation: The original sentence is negative but implies a positive meaning, so it's better to add "a" before "job".
0	Syntax	I have many parts of the manuscript still to type. Explanation: The word 'much' is used with singular countable nouns while 'many' is used with plural countable nouns. In your sentence, 'manuscript' is a singular countable noun, so it needs to be paired with 'many'. Additionally, we use 'left' instead of 'of', making the corrected version as stated in Correct Sentence section above.
1	Other Category	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	I don't want any trouble. Explanation: The adverb "any" must be placed before the noun it modifies in a negative statement. In your original sentence, "any" comes after the verb "is," making the sentence syntactically incorrect.

0	Syntax	Some of them made as many errors as twenty. (the number '20' needs to be in words since it refers to a quantity)
0	Syntax	The corrected sentence should be 'Sally kissed herself.' But in this case, it's actually incorrect because 'herself' refers to someone who is female and singular, so it implies that 'Sally' is both those things as well. A more accurate correction would be 'Sally kissed him.', assuming that a male individual is being referred to here.
0	Semantics	The corrected sentence would be: "Drew believes that I think Rosie loves magazine ads" or "I think Drew believes that Rosie loves magazine ads," depending on the intended meaning. The original sentence has unclear semantic relationships between the subjects and verbs.

0	Other Category	The sentence "I didn't have a red cent" is grammatically correct but can be slightly revised for better clarity. You may consider saying "I didn't have a single penny" instead as it has more universal understanding than "red cent," although both convey the same idea in different dialects.
0	Syntax	The sentence should be "The book of poems from Blackwell takes a very long time to read" or "The book of poems takes a very long time to read, from Blackwell". Currently, it's unclear whether "and from Blackwell" describes the action of taking a long time to read or modifies "the book of poems," causing confusion in meaning and syntax.
0	Other Category	The book with a red cover takes a very long time to read. Explanation: In the original sentence, there was no specified noun related to "the one". Therefore, I added the word "book" as it seems more appropriate in this context.

0	Semantics	The sentence is already correct. Explanation: This sentence is grammatically correct but contains a semantic error. Not all tigers have orange fur; some species, such as the South China tiger and the Sumatran tiger, have different colored fur patterns. Therefore, it would be more accurate to say that most tigers have orange fur marked with black stripes instead of any tiger.
0	Semantics	The sentence is already correct if we're talking about typical tigers; however, it's important to note that albinism in animals can result in white fur instead of orange. Here's a corrected version considering albino tigers: "Any albino tiger has white fur, marked with black stripes."
0	Syntax	You can choose any flower you see. Explanation: The verb "pick" implies a deliberate action with some force involved, whereas "choose" suggests selecting from available options without necessarily implying physical manipulation. In this context, it seems more appropriate to allow someone to select freely rather than physically picking every single time they come across a desirable flower.
0	Syntax	The sentence is already correct.

1	Syntax	The Dodgers beat the Red Sox and lost to the Giants. Explanation: In your original sentence, both clauses contain past tense verbs ("beat" and "were beaten"). However, they convey opposite meanings - winning in one case and losing in another. Using "lost" instead of "were beaten" makes it clear that the two events have different outcomes.
0	Other Category	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The man whom Mary loves and Sally hates computed my tax. Explanation: In the original sentence, the relative pronoun 'who' does not agree with its antecedent 'the man'. Instead, we need to use 'whom', because it is the object of the verb in the relative clause ('loves').
0	Syntax	The kennel that Mary made and where Fido sleeps has been stolen. Explanation: In the original sentence, there is a misinterpretation about the function of "and" as it seems to connect two verbs for the same subject ("Mary made" and "Fido sleeps"). Instead, we need to use "where" in order to clarify that both actions relate to the same object (the kennel), but they don't have to be performed by the same agent.

0	Syntax	The idea dismayed the Prime Minister because the Dome was dull. Explanation: In order for a sentence to be grammatically correct in English, it must have both a complete thought and proper word order. Here, "that" indicates that what follows is additional information rather than the main clause. This makes the original sentence lack a clear main clause, causing a syntax error. To fix this issue, we can add "because," turning what comes after into the reason for the action in the main clause.

0	Syntax	Which article did Terry file without having read? Explanation: In order for the sentence to be grammatically correct, we need to use a clause with the past participle form of the verb instead of just using an infinitive ("reading" instead of "to read"). This makes it clear that the action was completed in the past but at an unspecified time before another past event.
0	Other Category	You may want to try and buy some whisky instead. The word "whiskey" is the Irish spelling; for Scotch, Canadian, and American varieties, it's typically spelled "whisky".
0	Syntax	She goes and buys some whiskey. Explanation: The present participle form ("buying") cannot be used after an auxiliary verb such as "does," "do," "did," "is," "am," "are," "was," "were" or "be" in a simple tense sentence when referring to an action completed by the subject. In your example, we need to use the base form of the verb instead - "buy".

0	Syntax	The sentence should be "What John promised was to be gentle" (with a singular verb form "was") instead of "what John promised is to be gentle".
0	Syntax	Which books about cooking does Henri want to buy? Explanation: In order for a question in English to be grammatically correct, it must follow the structure "Wh-word + auxiliary verb (+ subject) + main verb + ...", where Wh-words include "who", "what", "which", etc. Therefore, your original sentence "Henri wants to buy which books about cooking?" needs to move the auxiliary verb "does" before "which".

0	Other Category	The bear sniffs. Explanation: In the original sentence, "bears" is plural but no corresponding verb in its plural form is used. Changing it to a singular noun ("bear") allows for the use of the third person present tense singular verb "sniffs".
1	Syntactically Correct	The sentence is already correct. Explanation: - Syntactic analysis checks if a sentence follows the rules of grammar in terms of word order and structure. In this case, the sentence has a subject ("to steal talismans"), verb ("is") and an object ("from witches"). It's grammatically well formed, making it syntactically correct. - Semantic analysis deals with meaning and interpretation. This is beyond the scope here as we only need to check for syntax errors. - Morphological analysis concerns individual words and their internal structures such as prefixes and suffixes. All the words used in this sentence are correctly spelled and structured, so there's no morphological issue. - Since the sentence doesn't fall under any specific category other than being syntactically correct, it simply falls into 'Other Category', but since no further classification is required, just returning 'Syntactically Correct' would suffice.
0	Syntax	The sentence should be "Anson demonsized" if we're talking about turning someone into a demon. However, I suspect you meant to use the word "denounced," in which case the corrected sentence would still differ from what you provided. Here's the correction for both cases: If "demonized" is intended: "Anson demonized himself." If "denounced" is intended: "Anson denounced it." (Note: Without more context, I am assuming gender-neutral pronouns.)
0	Syntax	The sentence should be "You kicked yourselves" if referring to multiple people in an informal way. However, it's worth noting that "yourself" would typically be used for singular, second-person subjects. To refer to plural, second-person subjects, consider using "yourselves". So a more grammatically correct version could be: "You guys kicked yourselves."
0	Syntax	The book that I said I'd never read. Explanation: In the original sentence, there are two instances of "that" used back-to-back, which is generally considered incorrect in formal written English. Instead, we can omit the second instance of "that".
0	Syntax	The sentence should be "Anson** demonsed **the Khyber" or "Anson rose up the Khyber", depending on what you want to convey. The current formulation is grammatically incorrect as there is no standard verb "demonize" conjugated in past tense to "demonized".
0	Semantics	The sentence "It is not true that I might be going to the party" is semantically incorrect. A more appropriate way to express the intended meaning would be: "I am not going to the party."
0	Syntax	The correct form of the sentence should be "Kick him!" or "He kicks you.", depending on the intended meaning.
1	Syntax	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	You got an accurate description of whom? OR Whom did you get an accurate description of?
1	Other Category	The sentence is already correct.
1	Other Category	The sentence is already correct.
0	Other Category	The sentence is already correct.
0	Other Category	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence should be "Anson **denounced** David every day" instead of "demonized". "Denounce" means to publicly declare something to be wrong or evil; denunciation. Whereas, "demonize" refers to describing someone or something as being evil or morally corrupt.
0	Syntax	There is a program about Euripides on Radio 4 tonight.
0	Other Category	The sentence seems grammatically correct, but it might be historically inaccurate as phoenixes are mythical creatures and cannot be harmed by poison. A more appropriate category for this error would depend on the context in which the statement appears. For example, if this was a school assignment about Greek mythology, then an appropriate label could be "Historical Inaccuracy". However, without additional information I am assuming the role of a general language model and therefore categorizing the issue as simply "Other Category" since there is no clear grammatical or linguistic problem with the sentence itself. Nonetheless, here's how your response should appear: Label: 0 Category: Other Category The sentence is already correct.
1	Other Category	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	Anson danced extremely frantically at the trade show. Explanation: In your original sentence, there is a mismatch between the adverb ("extremely frantically") modifying the verb ("danced"), as it would be more appropriate for an adjective to describe a noun such as "Trade". I have restructured the sentence with proper word order and added an article before 'trade' so it correctly reads "at the trade show" instead of just "at Trade".
0	Syntax	You asked whom Medea gave something. The original sentence has incorrect word order and uses the object form "who" instead of the subject form "whom".
1	Syntax	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence should be "Medea tried to poison her children through the nurse" for it to be grammatically correct.
0	Semantics	The sentence should be "I feel that I know you."
0	Syntax	The correct form of the sentence would be "Will he be able to do it?" The original sentence contains a subject-verb disagreement, as "will" and "he" both refer to the same person, making the use of another auxiliary verb necessary for forming a question in this context.
0	Syntax	The corrected sentence is: "I saw that she was happy." The original sentence had an error in its verb tense agreement.
1	Other Category	The sentence is already correct.
1	Other Category	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence should be "Gilgamesh has fought the dragon" for proper tense agreement.
0	Syntax	The sentence should be "Anson thought that he was happy."
1	Syntax	The sentence is already correct.
0	Other Category	The corrected sentence is "I might not be going to the party but am washing my hair" or "I may not be going to the party; instead, I'm washing my hair".
0	Syntax	The sentence should be "I thought he liked me" instead of "I thought he liked myself".
1	Other Category	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence is long and could be simplified for clarity, but it is grammatically correct. Here's a simpler version: "Jason seems sick." However, if you want to keep the original meaning of the sentence, here's a corrected version with the same meaning: "It appears that Jason seems to be sick."
0	Semantics	You asked who saw what? Or, more specifically: "What did you see?" or "Who did you ask?" would both be grammatically correct ways to rephrase this question, depending on the intended meaning.
1	Other Category	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence "He can will go" is not grammatically correct. A corrected version could be "He will be able to go."
0	Syntax	A more grammatically correct way to ask the question would be: "How fierce was the battle?" The original sentence is missing a verb tense, making it incomplete and incorrect.
0	Syntax	You need to rephrase the question. Try asking "Which king did you ask about?" and then "Which city did he invade?" instead. The original sentence is grammatically incorrect because it tries to combine two questions into one using "which" twice, but doesn't specify what each "which" refers to.
0	Semantics	The sentence is already correct if we change "pigs" to "pork," since people do eat cooked pig meat (which is called pork), but not live pigs. So the corrected sentence would be: "It is some disgruntled old pigs in those ditches that humans love to eat (as pork)."
0	Syntax	The monkey is eating the banana.
0	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically incomplete and does not form a proper command or request. A more complete version could be "Burn them!" as an exclamation or "Please burn them" as a polite request.
0	Other Category	The statement that "it stinks" implies a negative evaluation, but it's unclear what specifically is being evaluated negatively in this context. Perhaps rephrasing the sentence would make the meaning clearer while avoiding any potential confusion. Here's an example: "It's unfortunate that Aphrodite is omnipotent."
1	Other Category	The sentence is already correct.
1	Other Category	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence should be "I inquired when WE could leave" since 'we' should be used instead of 'I' for consistency with the subject of the main clause.
0	Syntax	The sentence requires an object for the verb "kicked". A possible correction could be: "They kicked the ball."
0	Syntax	The monkey ate the banana.
0	Syntax	I would like to be able to swim.
0	Other Category	It is not possible for someone to physically kick themselves in a meaningful way. However, if you meant this as an idiomatic expression indicating self-reproach, then it would be better written as "I kicked myself *for* doing something stupid" to make your intended meaning clearer.
0	Syntax	The sentence is incorrect. A bookcase cannot run. It can only hold books.
0	Other Category	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence should be "Anson became muscular" or "Anson became a muscular person". The word "muscle-bound" is an adjective describing someone who has large muscles but cannot move freely because those muscles are too tight.
