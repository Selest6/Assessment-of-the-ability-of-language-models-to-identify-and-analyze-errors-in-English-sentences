1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the rules for subject-verb agreement (the plural subject "sailors" matches with the plural verb "rode") and word order in a simple sentence. Additionally, all words are used appropriately within their context.
1	Syntax	The sentence "The weights made the rope stretch over the pulley" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "weights", followed by the verb "made", and then we have a complete clause "the rope stretch over the pulley". This clause contains the object "rope", the verb "stretch", and the prepositional phrase "over the pulley". Therefore, it's syntactically correct.
0	Syntax	In present tense, intransitive verbs typically do not take a reflexive pronoun (e.g., "it wriggles loose"). Therefore, using "itself" instead of "it" is incorrect. A better way to phrase it would be "The mechanical doll wriggled loose." or "The mechanical doll was wriggling itself free."
1	Semantics	The sentence "If you had eaten more, you would want less" is grammatically correct in English. It contains a conditional clause ("if you had eaten more") followed by a hypothetical consequence ("you would want less"). This type of construction is commonly used in English to express cause-and-effect relationships or make predictions about what might happen under certain conditions. In terms of semantics (the meaning of words and how they combine to form meaningful expressions), this sentence makes sense because it implies that eating too much can lead to a decrease in desire for food. Therefore, I would classify this as a correct English sentence with no syntax, morphology, or other errors.
0	Semantics	The sentence is grammatically correct but semantically incorrect. The phrase "as you eat the most" implies a comparison between different individuals or entities in terms of eating, while "you want the least" suggests that the same individual desires the smallest amount. This creates a contradiction because it's unlikely for someone who eats the most to simultaneously desire the least.
0	Semantics	This sentence is semantically incorrect because it contains a contradiction. Wanting something implies desiring or wishing for it, while eating less suggests a lack of desire. Therefore, the idea conveyed by the sentence does not make logical sense.
0	Syntax	The issue with this sentence lies in its syntax. Specifically, there is a mismatch between the subjects of the two clauses connected by "the more... the more" construction. In order for the sentence to be grammatically correct, both clauses need to have parallel structures. Here's how it could be corrected: Corrected Sentence: "I demand that the more John eats, the more he pays."
1	Semantics	This sentence is grammatically correct but semantically there could be an issue depending on the context. The word "she" in the second clause implies a connection between the two clauses, suggesting that listening to the Grateful Dead causes depression for the subject (Mary). However, without additional information or context, it's unclear whether there is actually a causal relationship between these two events. Nonetheless, as a standalone sentence with no further context provided, I will assume that it is syntactically, morphologically, and semantically correct; therefore, returning 1.
1	Syntax	This English sentence is grammatically correct. It follows a structure known as a correlative construction ("the Xer Y did, the Zer Y became"), in which two parallel clauses (one with "angrier" and one with "more") modify the subject "she." Both clauses contain comparative forms, indicating an increase or degree. Additionally, there are no spelling, punctuation, or word-formation errors. Therefore, the syntax of this sentence is correct.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the rules for subject-verb agreement, word order, and tense consistency. Additionally, the idiomatic expression "the higher the stamps, the lower his expectations are" contributes to its semantic coherence.
1	Semantics	This sentence is grammatically correct in English. In terms of meaning (semantics), it implies a cause-and-effect relationship between someone's behavior (being obnoxious) and how much attention they receive from others (less).
1	Syntax	The sentence "John was lots more obnoxious than Fred" is grammatically correct. In this sentence, "lots more" functions as a degree modifier expressing a high or extreme degree of comparison between two things (in this case, John's level of obnoxiousness compared to Fred). This construction is commonly used in informal spoken English but may be considered less formal in written English. Nonetheless, it does not make the sentence incorrect, so I am returning 1 for this input.
1	Semantics	This sentence is semantically correct because it expresses a cause-and-effect relationship between two events (giving beer to people and people getting sick) in a logical way. Increasing the number of people who receive beer will likely result in an increase in the number of people who become ill as a consequence.
0	Semantics	This sentence is semantically incorrect because it implies a causal relationship between two independent clauses that are not logically connected in reality. Specifically, saying "the more X happens, the more Y hates Z" suggests that there is a direct cause-effect relationship between X and Y's emotions towards Z, which is usually not the case. In addition, smoking is generally considered a harmful behavior, so suggesting that someone increases their consumption of cigarettes as a result of another person's actions may have negative connotations.
1	Semantics	This English sentence is grammatically correct and semantically meaningful. It implies a causal relationship between two events - an increase in the number of pictures of "him" appearing in the news causing John to become increasingly embarrassed.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Every senator seems to become more corrupt, as he talks to more lobbyists." is grammatically correct in terms of syntax. In this context, it follows the rules for forming phrases and sentences correctly. Each part of the sentence has a clear role and relationship with other parts, making the overall structure coherent and understandable.
0	Syntax	The sentence "Who does John visit Sally because he likes?" has incorrect syntax. Specifically, there is a missing clause or subject after "because he likes". A corrected version could be "Who does John visit Sally because he likes her?" or "Who does John visit because he likes Sally?"
1	Syntax	The sentence "Marianne did not leave" is grammatically correct in terms of syntax because it follows the standard structure of a simple sentence with an auxiliary verb ("did") followed by a subject ("Marianne") and a main verb ("leave") in its past tense form. Additionally, the negative particle ("not") has been correctly placed after the auxiliary verb, making the overall meaning clear and unambiguous.
1	Semantics	The sentence "He could not have been working" is grammatically correct in English. It expresses a past situation that was impossible or unlikely. This type of construction is often used in hypothetical situations or when discussing events that did not actually occur. For example, it might be said by someone who sees no evidence of recent work being done, but suspects that the subject may have been doing something else during that time. In terms of linguistic components, there are no issues with syntax (word order), morphology (word forms), or other grammatical aspects, so the sentence is semantically sound.
1	Syntax	The sentence "He can not have been working" is grammatically correct in English. Here's why: * "he" is a pronoun referring to a male subject. * "can not" is the contraction of "cannot," indicating ability or permission (in this case, negating it). * "have been" indicates past perfect continuous tense, expressing an action completed before another past action. * "working" is a gerund verb acting as an adjective modifying the implied subject "he." Therefore, the sentence structure follows standard English syntax rules for forming negative statements using modal verbs, past perfect continuous tense, and gerund verbs.
1	Syntax	The sentence "You will believe Bob." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure in English. The subject is "you", the verb is "will believe" (a future tense form of the verb "to believe"), and the object is "Bob". Additionally, each word is spelled correctly and all necessary punctuation marks have been used appropriately.
1	Syntax	The sentence "John has not kissed Mary" is grammatically correct in terms of syntax because it follows the rules for constructing an English sentence. It contains a subject ("John"), an auxiliary verb ("has"), a negation adverb ("not"), a past participle verb form ("kissed") and an object ("Mary"). All these elements are arranged correctly according to the standard word order (SVAO) in English.
1	Syntax	The sentence "I said that never in my life had I seen a place like Bangor" is grammatically correct. It follows the rules for subject-verb agreement, word order, and punctuation in English. Additionally, it utilizes subordinating conjunctions ("that") and complex verb tenses appropriately to convey meaning.
0	Syntax	In English, personal pronouns usually come before the verb they are associated with. Therefore, "it" should be placed before the verb "looked up," making the sentence grammatically correct as "Mickey looked it up."
1	Syntax	The sentence "There tended to be a lot of discussion" is grammatically correct. The subject-auxiliary inversion ("there tended") followed by the bare infinitive verb phrase ("to be a lot of discussion") is a common way to express passive voice in English. Therefore, there are no syntax errors in this sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence "John tried to be a good boy" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "John" is a proper noun, referring to a specific person named John. Proper nouns always begin with a capital letter. * "tried" is a past tense verb indicating an action completed in the past. It agrees with the subject "John." * "to be" is an infinitive phrase acting as the complement of the verb "tried." Infinitives typically follow verbs such as "try," "help," or "want." * "a good boy" describes what kind of attempt was made by John when he tried. This is called a predicate nominative since it renames the subject.
1	Other Category	The sentence "John is eager" is grammatically correct in standard English. The subject of the sentence is "John", a proper noun, and it is connected to the predicate "is eager" by a linking verb. In this case, "eager" functions as an adjective describing the subject's state or condition. No errors in syntax, semantics, or morphology can be identified in this sentence.
1	Other Category	The sentence "We want John to win." is grammatically correct in standard English. The subject of the sentence is "we," indicating the speaker or writer and others included in the statement's context. The verb "want" expresses a desire for something to happen. The infinitive phrase "to win" functions as the direct object, specifying what action is desired. Overall, the morphological structure of each word is appropriate for its intended meaning, and there are no semantic errors. Additionally, the syntax follows conventional rules with proper agreement between subjects and verbs and an unambiguous grammatical relationship among words. Therefore, it falls under the category of "Other" since neither syntactic, semantic, nor morphological issues have been identified.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct in terms of syntax because it follows the rules for word order and structure in English. It has a subject ("the box"), a verb ("contained"), and an object ("the ball") and expresses a complete thought. Additionally, there are no misspelled words or incorrect punctuation marks.
0	Semantics	In this sentence, the verb "escaped" does not make sense with the subject "the tube." Things do not typically escape from gases; rather, gases might escape from things. A more appropriate way to phrase the sentence would be "The gas escaped from the tube," or perhaps "The tube was emptied by escaping gas." Therefore, I would classify this as a semantic error because the meaning of the words in the sentence, when taken together, does not form a coherent idea.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Water bubbled up out of the kettle" is grammatically correct in terms of syntax because it follows a proper sentence structure with a subject ("water"), verb ("bubbled") and an object or prepositional phrase ("up out of the kettle"). All the words used are correctly conjugated for tense and number agreement, making the sentence syntactically sound.
1	Other Category	This sentence is grammatically correct and its meaning is clear. It falls under the category of "Other" because there are no apparent issues with syntax (sentence structure), semantics (meaning), or morphology (word formation). In this case, the statement simply conveys that a particular tube-shaped object ("the tub") had an issue where it released water from within it due to some kind of leakage.
1	Syntax	The sentence "What the water did to the bottle was fill it." is grammatically correct in terms of syntax. It follows a cleft sentence structure where the subject ("what") is emphasized by being placed at the beginning of the sentence, followed by an auxiliary verb ("was"), a noun phrase ("the water"), another auxiliary verb ("did"), and the past participle form of the verb ("fill"). This construction allows for clarity in expressing complex actions or events with emphasis on specific parts of the sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence "What the water did to the whole bottle was fill it." is grammatically correct in terms of syntax. Here's why: * "What" serves as a relative pronoun introducing the clause "what the water did to the whole bottle". * "the water" is the subject of the main verb "did", while "it" refers back to "the whole bottle" as its antecedent. * "fill" functions as the complement of the linking verb "was". Overall, the structure of the sentence is complex but well-formed, making it syntactically correct.
0	Semantics	In this sentence, "leak" requires an object but no agent can leak something freely. A more appropriate way to phrase it would be "The fluid leaked out freely from the tank."
1	Syntax	The sentence "John lay the ball in the box" is grammatically correct. In English, the past tense of the verb "to lie" (meaning to place something down gently) is "lay." Therefore, there is no syntax error in this sentence.
1	Other Category	The sentence "John owns the book." is grammatically correct in terms of syntax, semantics, and morphology. It has a proper subject-verb agreement with a clear agent (John) who possesses something (the book). Additionally, all words used in their appropriate forms (owns - third person singular present tense verb; the - definite article; book - common noun). Therefore, it falls under the category 'Other' as there are no specific errors found related to syntax, semantics or morphology.
1	Syntax	The sentence "We persuaded Mary to leave and Sue to stay" is grammatically correct. It uses a coordinating conjunction ("and") to link two independent clauses, each with its own direct object ("Mary to leave" and "Sue to stay"). This structure is called "cleft-sentence", which is a type of complex sentence where a subordinate clause is separated by a main clause using a conjunction such as 'and'. Therefore, it's syntactically correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct. It contains multiple clauses connected by a conjunction ("even though"), with appropriate punctuation (a comma) separating them. Each clause has a subject and verb, making it complete and clear for understanding. Additionally, the use of modal verb "probably" in the main clause adds certainty level regarding most people's opinion about Klaus being considered guilty regardless of court decision.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Mary beautifully plays the violin" is grammatically correct. In this sentence, "Mary" is the subject, "beautifully" is an adverb modifying the verb "plays," and "the violin" is the direct object. The word order follows standard English syntax rules for a simple declarative sentence with a transitive verb.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains multiple issues with its structure that make it difficult for a native speaker to understand. Specifically, there are three adverbs ("clearly," "probably," and "immediately") used in succession at the beginning of the sentence, making it unclear what each modifies. Additionally, the phrase "French perfectly" could be interpreted as modifying either "learn" or "will learn." A clearer way to express the intended meaning might be: "John will likely learn French fluently and quickly."
0	Syntax	In English, we do not use both "to" and an indirect object in a double-object construction (i.e., two objects after the verb). The sentence "Sue gave Bill a book" or "Sue gave a book to Bill" would be grammatically correct, but using both forms together as in "Sue gave to Bill a book" is incorrect.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "the men," which is a plural noun. The verb "will leave" is in the future tense and agrees with the plural subject. Additionally, the word "all" serves as an adverb modifying the verb "leave." Therefore, there are no syntax errors present in this sentence.
1	Other Category	The sentence "John went home." is grammatically correct in standard English. It consists of a proper noun ("John") as the subject, followed by a verb ("went"), and an adverbial phrase ("home"). All words used have their correct forms (morphology), there is no ambiguity or logical inconsistency (semantics) and all parts are arranged according to syntactic rules for simple sentences with subjects and verbs. Therefore, it does not fall under any specific category but rather can be classified as generally correct.
0	Syntax	The phrase "seriously to the dean" in this sentence is incorrect. It seems that the speaker intended to say "they represented themselves seriously to the dean," or perhaps "they represented Mary seriously to the dean." As it stands, though, the meaning of the original sentence is unclear due to its faulty syntax.
0	Syntax	In English, the subject ("they") typically comes before the verb, but in this case it follows the verb ("love"). The correct form would be "They love us."
1	Other Category	The sentence "It is nice to go abroad" is grammatically correct in standard English. The subject "it" refers to an abstract or unspecified idea, and the phrase "to go abroad" functions as a gerund complement after the adjective "nice." No errors can be found with syntax, semantics, or morphology.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Mary intended John to go abroad" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules for subject-verb-object (SVO) word order in English. Here, "Mary" is the subject, "intended" is the verb, and "John to go abroad" is the object. Additionally, the infinitive phrase "to go abroad" correctly uses the particle "to" before the base form of the verb "go." Therefore, there is no error in syntax or any other aspect of the sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence "I remembered having kissed Mary" is grammatically correct. It follows the rules of English syntax, specifically the use of the past perfect tense ("had kissed") to indicate an action completed before another past action.
1	Syntax	The sentence "I can't believe Fred won't, either." is grammatically correct. The use of the coordinating conjunction "either" at the end of a sentence is acceptable in informal speech or writing as it connects with the previous statement indicating agreement or similarity.
0	Syntax	The sentence "John wants to read Fred's story, and I also want to" is syntactically incorrect because the verb in the second clause ("I also want to") does not have a complete thought or object associated with it. To make the sentence grammatically correct, the speaker could say "John wants to read Fred's story, and I also want to read something as well." This way, both clauses contain a clear subject-verb agreement and express a complete idea.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a syntactic error in the form of an incorrect relative pronoun usage. Instead of "who to", it should be "whom to invite". A more natural way to phrase the sentence would be "We wanted to invite someone, but we couldn't decide whom." Alternatively, changing the clause structure can avoid using 'whom': "We wanted to invite someone, but we couldn't decide on who."
1	Syntax	The sentence "Mary will read Fred's story, and Joe will read Holly's." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of English syntax. Each clause in the sentence contains a subject ("Mary," "Joe") and a verb ("will read"), and they are connected with coordinating conjunction "and". Additionally, each noun phrase has its possessive form ("Fred's" and "Holly's") showing possession correctly.
0	Syntax	The clause "Holly shouldn't" lacks a proper subject-verb agreement in the context of the matrix sentence. It would be better expressed as "Holly should not eat cabbage." or "Eating cabbage, Holly shouldn't (eat either)."
1	Syntax	The sentence "Mary came to be introduced by the bartender and I also came to be." is grammatically correct in terms of syntax. Each word is correctly used and placed in a way that makes sense. Additionally, the use of punctuation is appropriate. However, there may still be issues with semantic interpretation or other linguistic aspects, but syntactically it's correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "If I can, I will work on it." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules for subject-verb agreement, word order, and punctuation in English. The conditional clause "if I can" sets up a condition for the action described in the main clause "I will work on it," which is expressed using the appropriate verb tense (future). Additionally, there is no incorrect morphological formation or semantic inconsistency in the sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct. Here, 'Joe's neuroses bother his patrons, and Sally does too' can be broken down into two clauses - 'Joe's neuroses bother his patrons' and 'Sally does too'. In the first clause, we have a subject ('Joe's neuroses'), verb ('bother') and an object ('his patrons'). This structure follows standard English syntax rules for forming complete sentences. Similarly, in the second clause, we have a pronoun (Sally) as the subject, auxiliary verb (does), main verb (do) and the ellipsis indicating that it shares the same direct object with the previous clause ('patrons'). Therefore, there are no errors related to morphology or semantics here either.
0	Semantics	The sentence is grammatically correct but semantically unclear. It's ambiguous whether "it" refers to the same book that José didn't read or a different book that Lilly chose to read for him. To make the meaning clearer, consider revising the sentence to something like: "I know which book José didn't read for class, and which book Lilly read instead."
0	Semantics	The second sentence "this is the one which Fred won't do it" is semantically incorrect because the clause "do it" lacks a clear subject and object in this context. It's unclear what action or verb "it" refers to, making the sentence difficult to understand.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a misplaced modifier error. In the phrase "which book Mag read, and which book Bob said that you hadn't," it is unclear what "and which book Bob said that you hadn't" is referring to. It seems that there is a missing part in the sentence where we can connect the second clause with the first one smoothly. A possible correction could be: "I know which book Mag read, as well as which book Bob said that you hadn't."
0	Syntax	The clause "that you hadn't" does not have a clear antecedent in the sentence, making it unclear what "you hadn't" refers to. Additionally, there is a missing verb in the second part of the sentence after "my report". A corrected version could be: "I know which book Mag read, and which book Bob read my report that you hadn't finished."
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows the rules for subject-verb agreement, word order, and tense consistency. Additionally, the comparison between two things using "more than" is used appropriately.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Rusty talked about himself only after Mary did talk about him." is grammatically correct. Here, the use of "only" before "after" indicates that Rusty talking about himself happened immediately after Mary had already talked about him. This creates a temporal relationship between two events, making it clear who spoke first and when Rusty decided to speak about himself. Therefore, there are no syntax errors in the given sentence.
0	Syntax	The sentence "Fred talked about everything before Rusty did talk about something" contains redundant information in the second part of the sentence. It would be grammatically correct if it said "Fred talked about everything before Rusty talked about something." Alternatively, the first part could be changed to make it parallel with the second part, such as "Before Rusty talked about something, Fred talked about everything." As written, however, the repetition of "talked" makes the sentence unnecessarily wordy and difficult to follow.
1	Other Category	The sentence "John often meets Mary." is grammatically correct in terms of syntax, semantics, and morphology. Therefore, it falls under the category of "Other Category". It has a simple subject-verb-object structure (SVO) with appropriate tense, agreement, and word choice.
0	Syntax	In English, it is more common to say "The problem is perceived easily" rather than "The problem perceives easily". In the corrected version, "problem" is the subject and "is perceived" is the verb phrase in passive voice. In contrast, the original sentence incorrectly uses "perceives", an active verb form, with "problem" as the subject.
1	Syntax	The sentence "A hundred men surrounded the fort" is grammatically correct because it follows standard English syntax rules for word order in a simple sentence (Subject-Verb-Object). In this case, "a hundred men" serves as the subject, "surrounded" acts as the verb or predicate, and "the fort" functions as the object. All elements agree with each other in number, making the sentence understandable without any ambiguity regarding meaning.
0	Syntax	In English, we don't usually use the first person pronoun (I or me) as the subject when referring to an election. Instead, it is more common to say "I was elected" or "They elected me." The sentence "We elected me" incorrectly implies that the speaker both participated in the action and was the recipient of the action at the same time.
0	Syntax	The question contains a misplaced relative clause, causing confusion about what's being referred to by "he." A correct version could be "Which report did he submit that indicated John was incompetent?" or "What report indicating John's incompetence did he submit?"
1	Syntax	The sentence "Mary has always preferred lemons to limes." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of English syntax. In particular, the subject ("Mary") comes before the verb ("has preferred"), and the object ("lemons") comes after the verb and is followed by a preposition ("to") with its own object ("limes"). This structure correctly conveys the intended meaning (that Mary likes lemons more than she likes limes) and does not contain any grammatical errors or awkward constructions.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a preposition ("out") without an object. A proper object should follow "out" in order for the sentence to be grammatically correct. For example, it could be "He let the cats whine out (something)". Additionally, the clause "which were whining" doesn't seem to modify any noun or pronoun in the main clause, making its purpose unclear. It might work better as "the cats that were whining outside."
1	Other Category	The sentence "What did Bill buy?" is grammatically correct. It has a question word ("what") at the beginning followed by an auxiliary verb ("did"), subject noun phrase ("Bill"), and main verb ("buy"). This structure forms a proper interrogative sentence in English. Therefore, it falls under the category of 'Other' as there is no issue related to syntax, semantics or morphology here.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Mary saw the boy walking toward the railroad station." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules for English syntax. It has a subject ("Mary"), an auxiliary verb ("saw") that agrees with the subject in number and tense, and a predicate ("the boy walking toward the railroad station"). Additionally, the sentence contains a prepositional phrase ("toward the railroad station") that modifies the action described by the verb. Overall, the sentence's structure is clear and unambiguous, making it easy to understand its meaning.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a grammatical error in the word "giver." It should be "given" instead. Additionally, there is a missing article before "John," so it should read "the John." Here's the corrected version: "A proof that the claim had been made was given by the fact that John had lied."
0	Syntax	The sentence contains multiple issues with syntax, making it difficult to understand. A more clear way to phrase the same idea would be: "A fire, which was started by an overloaded transducer causing a short circuit, destroyed most of my factory."
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct. The verb "regarded" takes the gerund form "being" instead of a simple verb after it because "as" introduces a clause functioning as an adverbial modifying the verb. Additionally, the preposition "from" correctly links the two locations in the sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence "I want that Bill left to remain a secret" is grammatically correct in terms of syntax. In this case, "that" serves as a conjunction introducing a content clause, with "Bill left" being the verb phrase within the clause. Additionally, "to remain a secret" functions as an infinitive purpose adjunct expressing the reason for wanting something. Overall, each component of the sentence adheres to standard rules of syntactical construction.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a repeated verb ("drives") after "as", which makes it grammatically incorrect. A corrected version could be "I know a man whom Tom drives."
0	Syntax	The subject-verb agreement in the sentence is incorrect. The plural noun "cats" does not agree with the singular verb form "is." It should be changed to "are," making the corrected clause read as "Drowning cats, which are against the law, are hard to rescue." However, the first part of the sentence still has an issue since it doesn't make sense to say drowning cats are against the law; instead, we might rephrase it as something along the lines of "Rescuing drowning cats is a legal requirement." Overall, there are both syntactic (subject-verb agreement) and semantic issues here.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Muriel said nothing else than that she had been insulted" is grammatically correct. It follows the rules of syntax, including word order and structure. In this case, "nothing else than that she had been insulted" serves as a relative clause modifying what Muriel said, making it clear that she only repeated the information about being insulted.
0	Semantics	The sentence "Himself is understood by Rutherford" is grammatically incorrect because a reflexive pronoun such as "himself" cannot be the subject of a sentence. In this case, it seems there was an attempt to make "Rutherford" the object of understanding, but the phrasing is unclear at best. A possible correction could be "Rutherford understands himself."
1	Syntax	The sentence "I feel that Arch will show up" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "I", the verb is "feel", and the predicate is "that Arch will show up". This clause functions as a noun in the larger sentence, headed by the verb "feel". The tense of the verb "will show up" indicates future time reference, so it's clear who (Arch) is going to do what (show up). Therefore, there are no syntax errors in this sentence.
0	Syntax	The sentence "The proof this set is recursive is difficult" contains a subject-verb agreement error. The subject "the proof" is singular, but the verb "is" should be in its plural form "are." Therefore, the corrected sentence would be: "The proofs that this set is recursive are difficult."
0	Syntax	This sentence has a syntactic error because the clause "Henry plays the lute and sings" does not have a clear connection with the main clause "the madrigals sound lousy." A possible correction could be: "The madrigals that Henry plays on the lute and sings sound lousy," or "Henry's playing and singing of the madrigals sound lousy."
1	Syntax	The sentence "Tom picked these grapes, and I washed some turnips, and Suzie will prepare these grapes." is syntactically correct because it follows the rules for word order and punctuation in English grammar. Each clause contains a subject ("Tom", "I", "Suzie") followed by a verb ("picked", "washed", "will prepare"), and they are all connected with appropriate conjunctions ("and"). Additionally, the commas separate each independent clause correctly, making the overall structure of the sentence clear.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Where did you go and who ate what?" is grammatically correct in terms of syntax. It follows the rules for word order and structure in English. However, it may be semantically difficult to understand because there are two questions asked at once with blank variables (where, who, what) that need to be filled in order to make sense of the statement. But as a standalone sentence without context or specific information provided, its syntax appears to be correct.
0	Syntax	The phrase "Which boy's" at the beginning of the sentence is incorrect because it creates a question tag without an actual question. Additionally, there seems to be confusion in subject-verb agreement throughout the rest of the sentence as well (e.g., "did we elect", "guardian's employer"). A more grammatically correct version could be something like "Whose employer as president did we elect?" However, even then, the meaning might still be unclear due to ambiguity about what exactly is being referred to by "employer".
1	Other Category	The sentence "How sane is Peter?" is grammatically correct. It is a question asking about someone's mental state or condition. The word "sane" means mentally sound or healthy. Therefore, the sentence is appropriate in context.
1	Syntax	The sentence appears to be grammatically correct. It uses proper syntax rules for forming a complete sentence in English with two independent clauses connected by the coordinating conjunction 'and'. Additionally, it utilizes appropriate prepositions such as 'at' and 'where', along with articles 'the' and 'a', correctly to convey meaning.
0	Semantics	The sentence is grammatically correct but semantically incorrect as it's unlikely for two people to live at the exact same location on a road or river. A more appropriate way to phrase this might be "I live near the place where Route 150 crosses the Hudson River and so does my dad."
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct, with a clear subject ("she"), verb ("is"), and an object complement ("trying to make up to"). It follows standard English syntax rules for forming questions by inverting the order of the auxiliary verb ("is") and the subject pronoun ("she").
0	Syntax	The verb "get" does not agree with its past participle form "gotten." In modern standard American English, only the past participle form "got" should be used (e.g., "The wind had got off the plot"). Additionally, the phrase "of a plot" is unnecessary and confusing; it seems like it's trying to say "from a plot," but even then, the meaning would still be unclear without more context.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Mike talked about politics yesterday to my friends" is grammatically correct. It follows the basic structure of a simple sentence, consisting of a subject ("Mike"), an action verb ("talked"), and two prepositional phrases ("about politics yesterday" and "to my friends") providing additional information about the action. The word order is appropriate for an English sentence, with the subject coming first followed by the verb and then the objects or complements. Therefore, I would classify this as syntactically correct.
1	Semantics	The sentence "It was expected by the reporters that the principal would fire some teacher" is grammatically correct in terms of syntax (word order) and morphology (inflection). However, there might be a slight issue with semantic meaning - it's unclear whether the expectation was shared among all reporters or if it refers to an individual reporter. But overall, the sentence does convey a clear idea without ambiguity.
0	Syntax	The error in this sentence lies in the use of pronouns. The relative pronoun "that" cannot refer to both a singular female subject ("she") and an object ("hat"). Additionally, it's unclear who "she" refers to as there is no prior mention of a female individual in the conversation. To fix this issue, rephrase the sentence using clearer language and consistent pronoun usage, such as "Which hat did Mike say she never wears?" or "What kind of hat did Mike make a joke about, saying that he himself never wore it?"
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a double negative (quip never), which results in an incorrect meaning. Changing "never" to "ever" would make it grammatically correct. So, the corrected sentence would be: "Which girl did Mike quip ever wore this hat?" But still, this question sounds unnatural because we don't usually ask questions using 'quip'. A more natural way could be "Which girl did Mike say didn't wear this hat?" or "Which girl has Mike said wore this hat?"
1	Syntax	The sentence "We donated wire for the convicts to build cages with." is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "we," the verb is "donated," and the object is "wire." The prepositional phrase "for the convicts to build cages with" modifies the direct object "wire," clarifying who will use it. The sentence has a clear structure and follows standard English syntax rules.
0	Syntax	The sentence "I won't have some money" is grammatically incorrect because it uses a negative contraction ("won't") with an indefinite article ("some"). To make the sentence grammatically correct, either use a positive verb form ("I'll have some money") or replace "some" with a specific amount ("I won't have any money").
1	Semantics	The sentence "Do you believe the claim that somebody was looking for something?" is grammatically correct in English. The word "claim" can be used as a noun referring to an assertion or statement that someone has made. Therefore, it is semantically valid to use the phrase "believe the claim" in this context. However, depending on the specific scenario, there may be other factors to consider when evaluating whether the claim itself is true or false.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows the standard structure of a complex sentence with multiple clauses joined by conjunctions. Each clause has a subject and a predicate, and the verb tenses are consistent throughout the sentence.
1	Semantics	The sentence is grammatically correct but we don't know who it pleased. It would be semantically complete if a specific person or thing was identified as being pleased. However, without additional context, the sentence can still be understood.
0	Semantics	The pronoun "himself" in the sentence refers back to a male antecedent, in this case "Winston". However, when we use reflexive pronouns such as "myself", "yourself", "herself", etc., they cannot be used as object of preposition or object of verb (in our example - indirect object). Instead of using reflexive pronoun here, it would be more appropriate to say "I talked to him about him." So the original sentence is incorrect semantically because it violates the rule for usage of reflexive pronouns in English language.
0	Syntax	The first part of the sentence "That the fuzz wanted him worried John" is incorrect because it uses the past tense form "wanted" with an adjective "worried", which requires a helping verb such as "was". Additionally, there is no clear subject-verb agreement in this clause. Moreover, the word order is jumbled up making it difficult for the reader to understand who was worried by the fuzz. Therefore, the entire sentence needs restructuring to make it grammatically correct. A possible correction could be: "The fact that the fuzz had made John worried did not bother Mary, though."
0	Syntax	The coordinating conjunction 'if' should connect two grammatically equal parts, but here it seems to connect a main clause ('I'll work on it') with a noun phrase ('Sam will be working on it'). To fix this error, we could say either 'I'll work on it if Sam does' or 'If Sam works on it, I will too'.
1	Other Category	The sentence "I'll work on it if I can." is grammatically correct. It has a subject ("I"), an auxiliary verb ("will") that expresses future tense, a main verb ("work") in base form, and an adverbial clause ("if I can"). All these elements combine to make a coherent and meaningful statement. Therefore, there is no error in syntax, semantics or morphology.
0	Syntax	The phrase "with which for you to cut up the onions" is unnecessarily wordy and confusing. A more clear way to express this idea would be "to cut up the onions with." Additionally, it might sound better to say "a knife for cutting up the onions," as opposed to simply "a knife with which." Overall, a more natural-sounding sentence could be "Here's a knife for cutting up the onions for you."
0	Semantics	The clause "which not everybody knows" creates a semantic issue because it suggests that we are introducing or identifying something new, but there has been no prior mention of what "which" refers to in the sentence. This makes the use of "which" here incorrect; instead, a relative pronoun such as "that" would be more appropriate. So, a possible correction could be: "Fluffy is sick, something that not everyone knows."
1	Other Category	The sentence "Maxwell is quite a doctor" is grammatically correct, but its meaning (semantics) depends on the context in which it's used. In general, "quite a doctor" can be interpreted as an informal way of saying that Maxwell is a very skilled or experienced physician. However, without additional context, it could also imply that Maxwell has some qualities similar to those of a stereotypical doctor, such as being detail-oriented or analytical. Since there is no clear semantic issue with the sentence, we will categorize this under 'Other Category'.
0	Syntax	This sentence contains an extra comma after "tall" making it ungrammatical. A corrected version could be: "The younger woman might have been tall and the older one definitely was blond."
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct. It contains multiple independent clauses joined by conjunctions ("and") and each clause has a subject-verb agreement. Additionally, punctuation marks such as commas are used correctly to separate different parts of the sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence "I have to try to finish grading some papers" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "I", followed by a verb phrase "have to try to finish". This verb phrase consists of an auxiliary verb "have to" indicating obligation or necessity, another auxiliary verb "to be" in its present participle form "trying", and the main verb "finish" in its infinitive form "to finish". Finally, we have the object of the sentence "grading some papers". All these elements are arranged correctly according to English syntax rules.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a redundancy in "for" - it appears twice unnecessarily. A corrected version could be: "The socks are ready for you to put on and be planned." However, even then, the second verb "be planned" doesn't make sense as a follow-up action after putting on socks, so I would suggest instead: "The socks are ready for you to wear."
1	Other Category	The sentence "It is easy to play sonatas on this violin" is grammatically correct and does not have any issues with syntax, semantics or morphology. Therefore, it falls under the category of "Other". This category includes things such as word choice, style, register, tone, etc. In this case, there is no particular issue to highlight in these areas either, but I would like to point out that the sentence expresses a positive sentiment towards playing sonatas on the violin, indicating perhaps some level of skill or enjoyment associated with doing so.
1	Syntax	The sentence "This violin is difficult to play sonatas on" is grammatically correct. It has a clear subject ("this violin"), verb ("is"), and object ("sonatas"). The phrase "difficult to play" functions as an adjectival modifier describing the noun "violin". Therefore, it is structurally sound and can be understood without ambiguity or confusion.
0	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically incorrect because there is an extra "and" at the end. It would be grammatically correct if it said "My mother is easy to please my father." However, even without the extra "and," the meaning of the sentence would still be unclear as it stands. A better way to phrase the intended idea might be "My mother is easy to please, just like my father."
1	Other Category	The sentence "Poor Bill, it had started to rain and he had no umbrella." is grammatically correct in terms of syntax, morphology, and semantics. However, I am assuming that the task requires a more specific category other than these three, so I will classify it as "Other Category". This classification could be used for instances where there isn't an obvious error or issue with the sentence but it doesn't fit neatly into any of the provided categories. In this case, there may be some concern about the relevance of stating "poor bill" at the beginning of the sentence, but it does not affect the grammaticality of the sentence.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains multiple syntax errors that make it difficult for a native speaker to understand its meaning. Specifically, there is a missing article before "robbery" at the end of the sentence, and an extra comma between "that" and "robbery". Additionally, the first part of the sentence ("That the cops spoke to the janitor about it yesterday is terrible") does not seem to be related in context with what follows after the comma.
0	Syntax	The error in this sentence lies in syntax, specifically with subject-verb agreement. In the phrase "Every student, and he wears socks," there is a lack of consistency between singular (he) and plural (student). Changing it to "Every student and he are swingers" or "Each student wears socks" would make the sentence grammatically correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "That girl was given my binoculars by him." is grammatically correct in terms of syntax. In this sentence, we have a noun phrase ("that girl"), a passive verb form ("was given"), another noun phrase ("my binoculars"), and a prepositional phrase ("by him"). Each part of speech is used correctly and follows proper syntactic rules for word order and structure.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Bill didn't allege that Roger had eaten anything." is grammatically correct. The negation "didn't" properly negates the verb "allege," and the subordinate clause "that Roger had eaten anything" correctly follows the conjugated verb in the main clause. Additionally, the subject-verb agreement is consistent throughout the sentence.
1	Semantics	The sentence "Nobody who hates to eat anything should work in a delicatessen." is grammatically correct. In terms of semantics, it means that people who dislike eating food in general should not work in a place where food is sold and prepared (delicatessen). It implies that working in such an environment would be unpleasant for those individuals due to their aversion towards food.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Everybody around here who ever buys anything on credit talks in his sleep" is grammatically correct. It has a clear subject ("everybody"), verb ("talks"), and object ("anything"). Additionally, it uses proper punctuation and follows standard English syntax rules for word order and structure.
1	Semantics	The sentence is grammatically correct but semantically it lacks specificity as to whom the speaker cannot remember the name. It would be better to say "I can't remember the name of the person who had misgivings."
1	Syntax	The sentence "No writer, and no playwright, meets in Vienna." is grammatically correct. It follows the rules for subject-verb agreement (the singular subjects "no writer" and "no playwright" are correctly paired with the plural verb "meets") and punctuation (there is a comma after "writer" because it introduces an independent clause).
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a grammatical error related to subject-verb agreement. The plural subject "no writers nor any playwrights" does not agree with the singular verb form "meets". To fix the error, we need to change the verb to its plural form ("meet"). A corrected version would be: "No writers, nor any playwrights, meet in Vienna."
1	Semantics	The sentence is grammatically correct but semantically problematic because it implies an uncertain marriage with every student, which doesn't make sense in real-world contexts. It would be more appropriate to rephrase the sentence as "It is not certain whether you will marry a student."
1	Syntax	The sentence "Felicia kicked the ball off the bench" is grammatically correct. The syntax is proper with a subject (Felicia), verb (kicked), and object (the ball) along with a prepositional phrase ("off the bench") that describes where or how something was done.
1	Syntax	The sentence "I sent the package halfway around the world" is grammatically correct in terms of syntax because it follows the standard structure of a simple sentence with a subject ("I"), an auxiliary verb ("sent"), and an object ("the package") followed by an adverbial phrase ("halfway around the world"). Additionally, all words are used correctly and spelled properly.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Sam gave the ball out of the basket" is grammatically correct. Here, 'gave' is a past tense verb and it is used correctly with its subject 'Sam'. Also, all the articles, pronouns, prepositions, and nouns in the sentence are appropriately placed, making the syntax correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Sam offered the ball out of the basket" is grammatically correct in terms of syntax because it follows the rules for constructing an English sentence with a subject ("Sam"), verb ("offered") and object ("the ball"). Additionally, the prepositional phrase "out of the basket" provides additional information about where the action took place.
1	Other Category	The sentence "Park Square has a festive air." is grammatically correct and semantically meaningful. It contains no errors in syntax or morphology, so it does not fit into those categories. Therefore, I am categorizing it as "Other" with a score of 1 indicating its correctness.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "the worker," and the verb is "will have." The future tense indicates that at some point in the future, the worker will be in possession of a job. Additionally, "a" before "job" shows that we're referring to any random job, not specifically talking about a particular job already known by context or previously mentioned in conversation.
1	Semantics	The sentence "No one can forgive that comment to you" is grammatically correct but may have a minor semantic issue depending on context. In general, it implies that no person has the ability or right to pardon an offensive remark made towards someone (you). However, if "that comment" refers to something other than an offense, then forgiveness might be inappropriate. For instance, if the comment was sharing bad news, requesting help, or providing constructive criticism, then the statement could be considered incorrect because no forgiveness would be needed. Without further context, though, I will assume it's about an offensive remark, making the overall meaning correct despite potential misinterpretations based on specific scenarios.
1	Other Category	The sentence is grammatically correct and conveys a clear meaning (semantically correct). It follows the rules for word formation (morphologically correct) and has a logical structure with proper punctuation (syntactically correct). No specific issues can be identified in any of these linguistic areas; therefore, I categorize this under the “Other Category” as it does not belong specifically to syntax, semorphology or pragmatics.
1	Semantics	The sentence is grammatically correct in terms of syntax and morphology. However, semantically there is a contradiction between promising something to someone and then giving it to someone else. Therefore, while the sentence may be used for literary or dramatic effect, it does not represent a coherent state of affairs in reality.
1	Syntax	The sentence "I lent the book partway to Tony" is grammatically correct in terms of syntax. It follows a proper subject-verb-object structure with clear tense, agreement between subject and verb, and appropriate word order.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct in terms of syntax because it follows a proper structure where the subject (the farmer) performs an action (loaded) on the object (the cart), and there's a prepositional phrase ("with apples") providing additional information about how or what was loaded into the cart.
1	Syntax	This English sentence is grammatically correct in terms of syntax, as it follows standard subject-verb-object word order and has a clear meaning.
0	Semantics	The sentence "Martha carved the baby a toy out of wood" contains a semantic error because it implies that Martha performed an action (carving) on a human being (the baby). This type of action is generally considered inappropriate or harmful towards infants. A more appropriate way to phrase this sentence could be "Martha carved a toy for the baby out of wood."
1	Other Category	This sentence is grammatically correct and its meaning is clear. It falls under the category of "Other" because there's no issue with syntax (word order), semantics (meaning), or morphology (structure of words). Here, the verb "cuts" is used correctly, and the sentence implies that the bread can be cut easily.
0	Semantics	The sentence "Janet broke Bill on the finger" is semantically incorrect because people cannot be broken in the same way objects can. Additionally, it implies that Bill was hurt by Janet on his finger, but the sentence structure does not make clear who did the action to whose finger, so the intended meaning is unclear even if we ignore the fact that people can't be broken.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Janet broke the cup." is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Janet", a proper noun in the nominative case. The verb of the sentence is "broke" in the past tense, indicating an action performed by the subject. The object of the sentence is "the cup," a common noun in the accusative case, receiving the action of the verb. This structure follows standard English syntax rules for simple sentences.
1	Syntax	This English sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the basic structure of a simple sentence with a subject ("the visitor") and a predicate ("rang the bell"). Additionally, each word in the sentence is used appropriately and there are no grammatical errors such as incorrect verb tense or agreement between subjects and verbs.
0	Syntax	The sentence "We pulled free" is grammatically incomplete and lacks a clear object or context for the action being performed (pulling). This makes it difficult for the reader to understand what is actually being pulled free, resulting in unclear semantics. Therefore, the syntax structure needs improvement to convey the intended meaning clearly.
1	Syntax	The sentence "That movie always shocks people" is grammatically correct in terms of syntax because it follows the rules for forming a sentence in English. It has a subject ("that movie"), an auxiliary verb ("always"), and an object ("people"). Additionally, the word order is correct and there are no missing or extra words.
1	Syntax	The sentence "That movie always shocks" is grammatically correct in English. The subject of the sentence is "that movie," and the verb is "shocks." The word "always" functions as an adverb modifying the verb "shocks," indicating that it consistently or repeatedly has a shocking effect. Therefore, there are no syntax errors in this sentence.
0	Syntax	In English, we use the preposition 'into' or 'in' after verbs such as 'come', so the correct sentence would be 'Sharon came into the room' or 'Sharon came in the room'. Therefore, the original sentence is incorrect syntactically.
1	Other Category	The sentence "Bill sent a package to Tom." is grammatically correct in all aspects (Syntax, Semantics, and Morphology). Therefore it returns 1 indicating a correct sentence with no errors found. As there are no visible issues related to syntax, semantics or morphological structure, we categorize it under 'Other Category'.
1	Syntax	The sentence "That acorn will grow into an oak tree." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules for English syntax. In this sentence, the subject ("that acorn") comes before the verb ("will grow"), and the object ("an oak tree") comes after the verb. Additionally, the tense of the verb is consistent with the meaning of the sentence (future tense). Overall, there are no errors in the word order or grammatical structure of this sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence "He turned into a frog" is grammatically correct in terms of syntax because it follows the rules for word order and structure in English. It contains a subject ("he"), a verb ("turned") and an object ("a frog"). Additionally, the tense of the verb agrees with the time frame implied by the sentence (past).
1	Syntax	The sentence "I mixed the sugar into the butter." is grammatically correct in terms of syntax because it follows a proper structure with a subject ("I"), verb ("mixed"), and object ("the sugar into the butter"). It has a clear meaning and all words used appropriately according to their parts of speech.
0	Semantics	The sentence "Brian threw the fence with the stick" is grammatically correct but semantically incorrect because fences cannot typically be thrown. A more appropriate sentence might be "Brian used the stick to knock down the fence."
1	Syntax	The sentence "Mira condemned Terry for the accident" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Mira," who is performing the action of condemning. The object of the sentence is "Terry," who is receiving the action of being condemned. The preposition "for" introduces the reason for Terry's condemnation, which is "the accident." This sentence exhibits proper syntax with a clear subject-verb-object structure and appropriate use of prepositions.
1	Syntax	The sentence "We investigated the area for bombs" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "we", which is a pronoun in first person plural form. The verb is "investigated", which is the past tense of "investigate". The object of the verb is "the area", which is a noun phrase consisting of the definite article "the" and the noun "area". Finally, there is a prepositional phrase "for bombs" modifying the verb. Therefore, I would classify this as a syntax question because it deals with the arrangement of words in a sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence "I sensed his eagerness" is grammatically correct in terms of syntax as it follows the rules for constructing a well-formed sentence in English. It has a subject ("I"), an auxiliary verb ("sensed") and an object ("his eagerness").
1	Syntax	The sentence "They praised the dedication in the volunteers" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "they," who are doing the action of praising something. The direct object of the sentence is "the dedication," which is being praised by "they." Finally, we have the prepositional phrase "in the volunteers" modifying the noun "dedication," telling us where or on what the dedication was found. Therefore, there are no syntax errors in this sentence.
1	Other Category	This sentence is grammatically correct and has a clear meaning, so it can be labeled as true in terms of both syntax and semantics. It does not seem to have any issues with morphology either, since all words are used correctly and there are no spelling errors or other mistakes at the word level. Therefore, I would classify this example as belonging to an "Other Category," because it does not fit neatly into any of the three specific linguistic categories (Syntax, Semantics, Morphology) that we're considering here.
1	Other Category	The sentence "Sarah smiled a charming smile" is grammatically correct. Here, 'smiled' is a verb in past tense which agrees with the subject 'Sarah'. Also, we can use an article before a noun (charming) when it modifies another noun (smile). Therefore, there are no errors related to syntax, morphology or semantics. Hence, it falls under other category as it doesn't fit into any specific error type.
1	Other Category	This sentence is grammatically correct and has a clear meaning. The verb "beamed" is used correctly as an intransitive verb, and it agrees with its subject "Sandra". The direct object of the sentence is "a cheerful welcome", which refers to the action or behavior exhibited by Sandra. Therefore, there are no issues related to syntax, semantics, or morphology in this sentence.
1	Other Category	The sentence "You've really lived it up" is grammatically correct in English. It falls under the category of an idiomatic expression, which means a group of words established by usage as having a meaning not deducible from those of the individual words (e.g., over my dead body). In this case, "lived it up" is an idiom that generally means to have enjoyed oneself thoroughly or to have had a lavish or extravagant time.
0	Syntax	The verb "lift" in the sentence requires an agent (the doer of the action), but there is no noun or pronoun performing the action of lifting the paperback books. A corrected version could be "We can easily lift the paperback books onto the table."
0	Syntax	In this sentence, "books" is the subject and "lifted" is the verb. However, there seems to be a missing agent performing the action of lifting. A more grammatically complete version would be "Someone lifted the books onto the table." or "The books were lifted onto the table.", where we have an explicit subject or helper verb (be) indicating who performed the action.
1	Other Category	The sentence "Jessica loaded boxes under the wagon" is grammatically correct but may be contextually or factually incorrect depending on the situation it's used in. For example, if Jessica was trying to load boxes onto a parked wagon with its bed too high for her to reach, then she wouldn't be able to load them under the wagon. However, without additional information about the context, we cannot definitively say whether the sentence is factually accurate. From a linguistic standpoint, there are no errors in syntax, semantics, or morphology, so I have labeled it as 'Other Category'.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Jessica loaded boxes on the wagon" is grammatically correct in terms of syntax because it follows the rules for constructing a well-formed sentence in English with proper subject-verb agreement, word order, and use of prepositions.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Jessica crammed boxes at the truck" is grammatically correct in terms of syntax because it follows the rules for word order and structure in English. Here, "crammed" serves as the verb linking the subject "Jessica" with the object "boxes," while "at the truck" describes where the action took place. This makes the sentence understandable and coherent without any grammatical errors related to syntactic rules.
0	Syntax	The correct form of the verb "butter" in present tense requires an object to follow it (e.g., "Lora buttered the toast"). In this case, there's a preposition "at" inserted between the verb and its object, making the sentence grammatically incorrect.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Carla shoveled the walk." is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Carla," a proper noun in the nominative case. The verb of the sentence is "shoveled," a past tense regular verb that agrees with the subject in number (third person singular). Finally, "the walk" serves as the object of the sentence, completing the required elements for an acceptable simple sentence in English grammar.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Nora sent the book" is grammatically correct in terms of syntax because it follows a proper subject-verb-object (SVO) structure where "Nora" is the subject, "sent" is the verb, and "the book" is the object. Additionally, each word is correctly conjugated and inflected for tense and number.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Nora sent Peter the book." is grammatically correct in terms of syntax because it follows a proper subject-verb-object structure (SVO) where "Nora" is the subject, "sent" is the verb, and "Peter the book" is the object. Additionally, the word order is appropriate for an English declarative sentence, making the overall structure coherent and unambiguous.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Carla slid the book" is grammatically correct in terms of syntax because it follows the standard structure of a simple sentence (Subject-Verb-Object). In this case, "Carla" is the subject, "slid" is the verb or action word, and "the book" is the object or what was slid by Carla. Additionally, all words used in the sentence have proper conjugations based on their tense, making the sentence syntactically correct.
0	Semantics	The sentence "Carla slid at the book" is grammatically correct but semantically incorrect because it implies an unusual or impossible action. It's unclear what it means for someone to slide at a book. A more appropriate way to phrase the sentence might be "Carla slipped on the book," indicating that she lost her footing while walking due to the presence of the book.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Amanda carried the package to Pamela" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a simple sentence in English (Subject-Verb-Object). In this case, the subject is "Amanda," the verb is "carried," and the object is "the package." Additionally, the preposition "to" followed by the indirect object "Pamela" provides clear information about where or to whom the action was directed. Therefore, there are no syntax errors in this sentence.
0	Syntax	The subject of the sentence, "Packages", is inanimate and cannot perform actions such as driving. Therefore, the syntax of this sentence is incorrect because it assigns an action to something incapable of performing it.
0	Semantics	In this case, the sentence "The chair pushed" is grammatically correct but semantically incorrect because inanimate objects such as chairs cannot perform actions on their own without external force or agency. Therefore, it's unclear what or who the subject (the chair) is acting upon, making the sentence nonsensical in context.
1	Syntax	The sentence "We offered a job to her." is grammatically correct in terms of syntax because it follows the rules for constructing well-formed phrases and clauses in English. Specifically, the subject ("we") and verb ("offered") agree in number, and there is a clear object ("a job") as well as an indirect object ("to her"). Additionally, word order and punctuation are both appropriate for the intended meaning.
0	Syntax	The sentence "A job offered." is grammatically incomplete and incorrect because it lacks a subject or an object. In order for the sentence to be complete and grammatically correct, it should specify who or what is offering the job. For example, the sentence could be rephrased as "Someone offered a job" or "The company offered a job".
1	Other Category	The sentence "Brown presented a plaque to Jones." is grammatically correct in terms of syntax, semantics, and morphology. Therefore, it falls under the category "Other" since there are no errors found in the sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Carmen bought Mary a dress" is grammatically correct. In this sentence, we have a simple subject ("Carmen") followed by a verb ("bought"), and then two objects ("Mary" and "a dress"). Both the syntax (word order) and morphology (word forms such as past tense -ed on "bought") are correct in this sentence. Additionally, semantically it makes sense because people can buy things for others. Therefore, there's no error related to meaning or context either.
1	Other Category	The sentence "Carmen obtained the spare part at the hardware store" is grammatically correct in terms of syntax (sentence structure), semantics (meaning), and morphology (word formation). Therefore, it falls under the category of "Other." This type of question typically asks for a binary judgment on grammaticality rather than identifying specific linguistic issues, so no further explanation is needed.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Michelle kept the desk with the papers" is grammatically correct in terms of syntax because it follows a proper sentence structure in English (Subject-Verb-Object). In this case, "Michelle" is the subject, "kept" is the verb, and "the desk with the papers" serves as the object. Therefore, there's no need for additional words or phrases to make the sentence more clear or accurate.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Frances hid the presents in the drawer" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object (SVO) word order in English and each word is used appropriately in its proper form.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object (SVO) word order in English and each word is used correctly in its respective form. In this case, "the needle" serves as the subject, "poked" functions as the verb, and "the cloth" acts as the object.
1	Other Category	The sentence "Carrie touched that cat." is grammatically correct in terms of syntax, semantics, and morphology. Therefore, it falls under the category of 'Other'. No specific error or explanation can be provided as there is none.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Herman whipped the sugar and the cream" is grammatically correct in terms of syntax because it follows the rules for word order and structure in English. In this case, the subject (Herman) comes before the verb (whipped), and the objects (the sugar and the cream) come after the verb. Additionally, the use of the conjunction "and" connects the two objects together appropriately.
1	Other Category	The sentence "Linda taped the picture to the wall" is grammatically correct and has a clear meaning (semantically valid). It does not contain any morphological errors either. Therefore, it falls under the category of 'Other'.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Linda taped the picture onto the wall" is grammatically correct in terms of syntax as it follows a proper structure with a subject (Linda), verb (taped) and an object (the picture). Additionally, there is a preposition ("onto") followed by its complement ("the wall").
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct because it follows standard subject-verb-object word order in English ("The child and her mother clung together") and uses proper verb tense (past tense). Additionally, the coordinating conjunction "and" correctly joins two noun phrases as subjects of the sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence "This flyer and that flyer differ" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "this flyer and that flyer," which refers to two distinct flyers being compared. The verb "differ" indicates a comparison between them. In terms of syntax, the structure of the sentence is correct with a clear subject-verb agreement and proper use of conjunction in forming the compound noun phrase.
0	Semantics	The phrase "differ apart" is redundant because two things cannot differ without being different from each other in some way. Therefore, it is more appropriate to say "that flyer differs from this flyer."
0	Semantics	This sentence is grammatically correct but semantically incorrect because a jeweler typically doesn't scribble contracts with their name on it. Scribbling usually refers to writing quickly or carelessly, which would not be appropriate when signing a legal document such as a contract. Additionally, including one's own name in a contract isn't standard procedure; rather, parties involved in a contract sign or initial the relevant sections of the document.
0	Semantics	Acorns do not grow into oak trees; rather, they are the seeds from which oak trees grow. Therefore, the sentence "The gardener grew that acorn into an oak tree" contains a semantic error because it implies causality where none exists. A more accurate statement would be "The gardener planted that acorn, which grew into an oak tree."
1	Syntax	The sentence "I shaped a loaf" is grammatically correct. The subject "I" is the person performing the action, the verb "shaped" indicates the action being performed, and the object "a loaf" is what the action was performed on. This forms a simple and complete sentence in active voice with proper syntax.
0	Syntax	In English, a verb must agree with its subject in number. Here, the subject "children" is plural while the verb "amuses" is singular, causing a mismatch. To fix this error, we can change the verb to its plural form "amuse." Therefore, the corrected sentence would be "The children amused."
1	Syntax	The sentence "Susan whispered the news." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a simple sentence in English (Subject-Verb-Object). Here, "Susan" is the subject, "whispered" is the verb, and "the news" is the object. Additionally, all words are spelled correctly and used appropriately in their respective forms.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Susan whispered at Rachel" is grammatically correct. In this sentence, "whispered" is the past tense of the verb whisper, indicating an action performed by the subject "Susan." The preposition "at" indicates the direction or location of the action towards the object "Rachel," making the overall structure of the sentence clear and easy to understand. Therefore, it follows proper syntax rules for English language construction.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Ellen said that melons were selling well" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules for English syntax. In particular, the subject ("Ellen") comes before the verb ("said"), and the clause "that melons were selling well" correctly modifies the verb by providing additional information about what Ellen said. Additionally, the verb agrees with the plural subject ("melons") in number and tense. Overall, this sentence demonstrates good control of English syntactic structures.
0	Syntax	The sentence "Ellen said about the present conditions." is grammatically incorrect because it lacks a direct object for the verb "said". It's unclear what Ellen said something about. A corrected version could be "Ellen commented on the present conditions" or "Ellen said something about the present conditions.", depending on the intended meaning.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Ellen warned Helen against skating on thin ice" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules for subject-verb agreement, word order, and tense consistency in English. Additionally, the use of the verb "warned" with its direct object "Helen" followed by the preposition "against" and the gerund phrase "skating on thin ice" creates a clear meaning. This structure indicates who performed an action (warn) towards whom or what (Helen), as well as mentioning the cautionary advice ("skating on thin ice"). Therefore, there are no syntax errors present in this sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Cynthia nibbled on the carrot." is grammatically correct in terms of syntax. In this context, 'nibbled' is a past tense verb indicating an action performed by the subject 'Cynthia', who is modified by her proper noun. Meanwhile, 'on' serves as a preposition connecting the object 'the carrot'. This structure follows standard rules for constructing simple sentences with transitive verbs (verbs taking direct objects) in English language.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Cynthia chewed" is grammatically correct in English. The subject "Cynthia" is a proper noun, and the verb "chewed" is in the past tense, indicating completed action. Additionally, there is no missing or extra information, making it syntactically sound.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Paul laughed at Mary" is grammatically correct, with a subject (Paul), verb (laughed), and object (Mary). It follows standard English syntax rules for word order in simple sentences.
0	Syntax	The error in this sentence is syntactic because it has an incorrect word choice affecting the meaning of the sentence. In English, people can wink their eye but not their lip. So, a grammatically correct version would be "Linda winked."
0	Syntax	In the sentence "My heart is pounding me", the verb "pound" is incorrectly used in the passive voice with a reflexive meaning. The correct form would be "My heart is pounding (on its own)" or "I can feel my heart pounding".
1	Syntax	The sentence "Sharon fainted from hunger" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Sharon," and the verb is "fainted." The prepositional phrase "from hunger" functions as an adverbial modifier, providing additional information about the cause of Sharon's fainting. The syntax of the sentence is clear and logical, making it a grammatical English sentence.
1	Syntax	This English sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a simple sentence in English (Subject-Verb-Object): "The witch" is the subject, "poisoned" is the verb, and "the children" is the object. Additionally, each word is spelled correctly, there are no missing or extra words, and the tense of the verb agrees with the time frame established by the context of the sentence.
1	Other Category	The sentence "A grandfather clock ticked in the hallway" is grammatically correct. It consists of a subject ("a grandfather clock"), a verb ("ticked") and a prepositional phrase ("in the hallway") that modifies the verb. Additionally, there are no spelling or punctuation errors. Therefore, it falls under the category of 'Other' as it does not contain any syntax, semantic or morphological issues.
1	Syntax	The sentence "I squeezed the door" is grammatically correct in terms of syntax because it follows the subject-verb-object (SVO) word order in English and all the words are used correctly in their respective forms.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Over the fire there bubbled a fragrant stew." is grammatically correct in terms of syntax as it follows the standard structure of an English sentence with a subject ("a fragrant stew"), verb ("bubbled") and a prepositional phrase ("over the fire") providing additional information about where the action took place. All words used in the sentence are correctly spelled and inflected for their intended use.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Soaring temperatures are predicted for this weekend." is grammatically correct. The subject "soaring temperatures" agrees with the verb "are predicted," making the syntax correct. Additionally, the prepositional phrase "for this weekend" correctly modifies when the soaring temperatures will occur.
0	Semantics	This sentence has a semantic error because an inanimate object (the fort) is described as doing something active (fluttering). Only things that can move or change shape on their own can flutter. Flags attached to forts cannot cause the fort itself to flutter.
1	Syntax	This English sentence is grammatically correct. The subjects ("The voices") agree with their verbs ("echoed"), both singular in number. Additionally, the prepositional phrase "in the hall" correctly modifies where the action takes place.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a simple sentence in English, with a subject ("the stream") and a verb ("twists"), and provides additional information about where the action takes place using a prepositional phrase ("through the valley"). Additionally, the words are all spelled correctly and the tense of the verb is consistent throughout the sentence.
0	Syntax	The verb "present" should be used with the preposition "as" in this context, rather than being followed by the reflexive pronoun "selves." A correct version would be "A wonderful opportunity presented itself yesterday."
1	Syntax	The sentence "A wonderful opportunity presented itself to him yesterday" is grammatically correct in terms of syntax because it follows a proper structure with a subject ("a wonderful opportunity"), verb ("presented") and an object ("himself"). Additionally, the tense of the verb agrees with the time frame indicated by "yesterday."
1	Syntax	The sentence "Out of the box jumped a little white rabbit." is grammatically correct in terms of syntax because it follows the standard structure of an English sentence (Subject-Verb-Object). In this case, the subject is "a little white rabbit," the verb is "jumped," and there isn't a direct object, but rather an adverbial phrase modifying how or where the action took place ("out of the box").
1	Syntax	The sentence "Penny skated around the rink" is grammatically correct. The subject "Penny" is followed by a verb "skated," and an adverbial phrase "around the rink." This structure follows the rules of English syntax.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Jackie accompanied Rose" is grammatically correct. In this case, we have a simple sentence with a subject ("Jackie") and a verb ("accompanied"). Additionally, "Rose" serves as the direct object of the verb. This structure follows standard English syntax rules for forming a complete sentence.
0	Syntax	In English, plural nouns require a plural verb form. The subject "many information" is incorrect because "information" is an uncountable noun, so it does not have a plural form. Therefore, the correct sentence would be "Much information was provided." or "Many pieces of information were provided.", depending on what exactly you meant by "many".
0	Syntax	The noun "advice" is uncountable, so it should be used with a singular verb. The plural form "many advices" is incorrect. The corrected sentence should read: "John offers much advice."
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of syntax for constructing a complex sentence with two dependent clauses ("that Jones got" and "that Smith got") linked by a conjunction ("than"). Each clause modifies the subject of the main clause ("the cake"), and they all contain their own subjects and verbs, making the overall structure clear and unambiguous.
1	Syntax	The sentence "We recommend to eat less cake and pastry" is grammatically correct. However, it would be more natural to say "We recommend eating less cake and pastry." In the original sentence, "to eat" is an infinitive verb that follows the modal verb "recommend," but in modern English usage, it's more common to use a gerund (verb+ing) after a modal verb. Therefore, changing "to eat" to "eating" makes the sentence sound more natural. Nonetheless, since the original sentence is still technically correct, I will give it a label of 1.
1	Syntax	The sentence "I saw that gas can explode" is grammatically correct. The subject "I" is followed by a verb tense in the past simple form ("saw"), then we have a clause introduced by "that", and finally an action described with another verb phrase ("gas can explode"). All these elements work together forming a coherent structure following English syntax rules.
1	Syntax	The sentence "He washed her" is grammatically correct in terms of syntax because it follows a proper subject-verb-object structure where "he" is the subject, "washed" is the verb, and "her" is the object. Additionally, the tense of the verb agrees with the number and person of the subject (third person singular).
0	Syntax	The verb "wash" requires an object in English, so the sentence should be "Wash **you**!" with a proper question mark at the end if it's intended as a question. A grammatically correct version could be "Wash your hands," for example.
0	Syntax	In English, a noun or pronoun must always be accompanied by a determiner (such as "a," "an," or "the") unless it is possessive or plural. The phrase "no in" does not make sense because there is no corresponding noun or pronoun for which it could serve as a determiner. A corrected version of the sentence might read "They have none in." However, without additional context it's difficult to say for sure what the intended meaning was supposed to be.
0	Syntax	The pronoun "my" must come after the determiner "some". Therefore, the correct sentence would be "Some of my jobs are in jeopardy."
0	Syntax	In English, when using the word "that" as a conjunction to connect two clauses, the subject-verb order in the second clause should be inverted (i.e., the verb comes before the subject). Therefore, the correct sentence would be "It was the policeman who met several young students in the park last night." or "The policeman met several young students in the park last night."
0	Syntax	The sentence "did the policeman meet in the park?" is grammatically incorrect because it lacks a proper question word at the beginning to form a yes-no question. It could be corrected as either "Did the policeman meet someone in the park?" or "Did the policeman meet in the park with someone?" depending on the intended meaning.
1	Syntax	The sentence "John put old books in the box" is grammatically correct. In this sentence, we have a subject ("John"), an action verb ("put") and two objects ("old books", "the box"). This structure follows the rules for simple sentence construction in English (Subject-Verb-Object), making it syntactically correct.
0	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically incorrect because it lacks a proper verb in present tense after the subject 'the monkeys'. A corrected version could be: "The monkeys are proud of their leader."
0	Semantics	The sentence "John sounded very." is grammatically incomplete because it lacks a complement describing what John sounded like or how much he sounded (e.g., "John sounded very loud" or "John sounded very tired"). Therefore, the sentence is semantically incorrect as there's no complete meaning conveyed by the speaker.
0	Other Category	The sentence is grammatically correct but it lacks context or specific information for a definitive judgment. It expresses uncertainty about agreement, which can be interpreted in various ways depending on the situation. Thus, without additional context, it cannot be confirmed as completely accurate or inaccurate.
1	Syntax	The sentence "John bought a book on the table" is grammatically correct, so I will return 1. In terms of syntax, all parts of speech (nouns, verbs, prepositions, etc.) are used correctly in relation to each other. Here, we have a noun phrase ("John"), a verb phrase ("bought a book") and another prepositional phrase ("on the table"). Each part functions well within the structure of the sentence as a whole.
1	Other Category	The sentence "John called the president a fool" is grammatically correct in standard English. It contains a subject ("John"), an action verb ("called") in past tense, and two objects ("the president" and "a fool"). All the words used are correctly inflected for number (singular) and person (third). Therefore, there are no syntax or morphological errors. As for semantics, all words have their usual meanings, so it's unlikely that any confusion arises from understanding what each word means; however, whether calling someone a 'fool' is considered polite or accurate depends on context - but as stated earlier, we assume that grammaticality rather than politeness or truthfulness is being evaluated here.
1	Other Category	The sentence “I forgot how good beer tastes.” is grammatically correct in terms of syntax (word order), morphology (word structure) and semantics (meaning). It contains a subject (“I”), an auxiliary verb (“forgot”), an object (“how good beer tastes”) and it expresses a complete thought. Therefore, there is no clear error or problem with the sentence in any of these areas.
1	Other Category	The sentence "This teacher is a genius." is grammatically correct in standard English. It has a subject ("this teacher"), an auxiliary verb ("is"), and a predicate noun ("genius"). The word order follows the rules for simple declarative sentences in English. Therefore, there are no issues with syntax, semantics, or morphology.
0	Syntax	The verb "remain" should be used in a passive voice construction with an auxiliary verb such as "is." However, using "is" before "remained" creates a double-perfect tense which is grammatically incorrect in this context. It would be more appropriate to say "A good friend has been remaining to me by him," but even then it still sounds awkward due to the structure of the sentence. Consider revising the sentence for clarity.
1	Other Category	The sentence "John ate his noodle quietly" is grammatically correct in terms of syntax (sentence structure), semantics (meaning), and morphology (word forms). It falls under the category of other because it does not contain any errors related to these three areas of language study. Additionally, there is nothing particularly unusual or ambiguous about the sentence, so it can be confidently labeled as correct with a score of 1.
1	Syntax	The sentence "A smith hammered the metal" is grammatically correct in terms of syntax because it follows the standard structure of a simple sentence (Subject-Verb-Object). Here, 'A smith' is the subject, 'hammered' is the verb, and 'the metal' is the object. Additionally, each word is correctly spelled and punctuated appropriately.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Sandy removed her ballet shoes" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure for an English sentence (Subject-Verb-Object). In this case, the subject is "Sandy", the verb is "removed", and the object is "her ballet shoes". Additionally, the use of possessive pronouns ("her") before a noun or noun phrase is also grammatically correct in English.
1	Other Category	The sentence "This week will be a difficult one for us." is grammatically correct. It consists of a subject ("this week"), a verb ("will be"), and an adjective phrase ("a difficult one") modifying the subject. Additionally, there is a prepositional phrase ("for us") indicating who the difficulty applies to. No errors in syntax, semantics, or morphology can be identified in this sentence.
1	Other Category	The sentence "Benny worked in a shoe factory when he was a student" is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple sentence with a time clause added for additional information about when Benny worked at the shoe factory. This sentence does not contain any errors in syntax (word order), semantics (meaning), or morphology (structure of words). Therefore, it falls under the category of "Other".
1	Syntax	The sentence "Everyone hoped that she would sing" is grammatically correct. In terms of syntax, it follows a typical structure with a subject ("everyone"), verb ("hoped") and an object ("she would sing"). Additionally, the tense is consistent throughout, making the sentence easy to understand.
1	Syntax	The sentence "This proved a decisive factor" is grammatically correct. It follows standard English syntax rules for word order and structure in a simple sentence with a subject ("this"), verb ("proved"), and object complement ("a decisive factor").
1	Other Category	This English sentence is grammatically correct, and the words used in it are appropriate for their context. Here, a crocodile (noun) is performing an action (devouring), and there is an object (doughnut) being acted upon. No errors in syntax, semantics or morphology can be found here.
1	Other Category	The sentence "John is afraid of Bill" is grammatically correct in English. It has a clear subject ("John"), verb ("is"), and object ("Bill"). Additionally, it uses appropriate preposition "of" after the adjective "afraid". Therefore, there are no issues related to syntax, semantics or morphology. Hence, we can categorize it under "Other Category", as there's nothing specific to point out regarding any grammatical aspect.
0	Syntax	The preposition "under" in this context requires a complement (a noun or pronoun) following it directly without any intervening words such as articles ("the", "a") or other prepositions. A corrected version could be "John put the bathtub under something."
1	Syntax	The sentence "John placed Kim behind the garage" is grammatically correct. The syntax is correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure in English. In this case, "John" is the subject, "placed" is the verb, and "Kim behind the garage" is the object. Additionally, the word order is correct and there are no missing or extra words.
0	Syntax	The sentence "Kim depends for Sandy" is grammatically incorrect because it uses a preposition ("for") where a verb is expected. A more appropriate way to phrase this idea would be "Kim depends on Sandy."
1	Syntax	The sentence "John put the book in the box" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "John", the verb is "put", and the objects are "the book" and "the box". The word order follows standard English syntax rules for a simple sentence with a transitive verb.
1	Other Category	The sentence "John taught English Syntax to new students." is grammatically correct. It contains a subject (John), a verb (taught), an object (English Syntax), and an indirect object (new students). Therefore, there is no syntax or morphological error in the sentence. Additionally, the meaning of the sentence is clear; thus, it does not contain any semantic errors either. Hence, the sentence falls under the category of "Other" as it has no issues related to syntax, semantics, or morphology.
1	Syntax	The sentence "John regards Bill as a good friend" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an English sentence (Subject-Verb-Object), where "John" is the subject, "regards" is the verb, and both "Bill" and "a good friend" serve as objects for the verb. Additionally, the use of preposition "as" before the object complement "a good friend" makes the meaning clearer by showing the relationship between two nouns or pronouns. Overall, there's no error in syntax, semantics, morphology, or any other category in this sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Kim put in the box." is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Kim", the verb is "put" and "in the box" is the prepositional phrase acting as an adverbial describing where the action took place. Therefore, it follows the standard structure of a simple sentence (Subject-Verb-Object) with additional information about location provided by the preposition "in".
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct in terms of syntax because it follows the rules for word order and structure in English. The subject ("the chickens") comes before the verb ("seem"), and a prepositional phrase ("of the farmer") correctly modifies the verb by telling us what the chickens are fond of.
1	Syntax	The sentence "The rules require that the executives be polite" follows the rules of syntax in English. It has a subject ("the rules"), a verb ("require") and an object ("that the executives be polite"). Additionally, the verb agrees with its plural subject. Therefore, I would classify this as grammatically correct.
0	Syntax	The subject ("That Fred") and verb ("was nominated") do not agree in number; it should be "Fred" instead of "That Fred". Also, there is an incorrect word order - the direct object ("Bill") should come after the verb, but here it comes before it. A correct version would be: "The crowd nominated Fred." or "Fred was nominated (by the crowd)."
1	Syntax	The sentence "They were taking a hard look at possible FTA" is grammatically correct in standard English. Here's an explanation for each part of the sentence: * "They" is a plural subject pronoun referring to a group of people. * "were taking" is the past continuous tense of the verb "to take," indicating ongoing action in the past. * "a hard look" is a noun phrase meaning a thorough examination or consideration. * "at" is a preposition introducing the object of the preposition, which follows it immediately. * "possible FTA" is a noun phrase consisting of an adjective ("possible") modifying another noun ("FTA"). "FTA" could be an abbreviation for various things (such as Free Trade Agreement), but its specific meaning isn't necessary for understanding the syntax of the sentence.
0	Semantics	The sentence "John paid me against the book" is grammatically correct but semantically incorrect because it does not make logical sense. To pay someone means to give them money in exchange for goods or services, so paying someone "against" something implies a conflict rather than an exchange. A more appropriate way to phrase the intended meaning might be "John paid me for the book," indicating that he gave me money as payment for buying the book from him.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of syntax for constructing an English sentence. It has a subject ("the committee"), a verb ("will study"), and an object ("the feasibility of setting up a national computer network"). Additionally, the sentence uses proper tense ("will study" indicates future action) and word order (subject-verb-object).
0	Syntax	The sentence "We made them be rude" is grammatically incorrect. A more appropriate way to phrase this idea would be "We made them act rudely." or "We caused them to be rude." In the original sentence, using "be" in conjunction with an adjective ("rude") without a linking verb (e.g., "act," "appear," etc.) creates a syntax error because it results in an improper sentence structure.
1	Syntax	The sentence "After reading the pamphlet, Judy threw it into the garbage can." is grammatically correct. The subject of the first clause is "Judy," who is performing the action of reading in the past tense (as indicated by "reading"). In the second clause, "it" refers back to "the pamphlet," indicating that Judy threw the pamphlet into the garbage can after she finished reading it. Both clauses follow standard English syntax rules for word order and structure, making the sentence grammatically correct.
0	Syntax	The verb in the sentence must agree with its subject in number. In this case, the subject "students" is plural, but the verb "reads" is singular. A correct plural form for the verb would be "read". So a possible correction could be: "Students studying English read Conrad's 'Heart of Darkness' while at university."
1	Other Category	The sentence "I read some of the book." is grammatically correct in English. It consists of a subject ("I"), an auxiliary verb ("read" in past tense), a determiner ("some"), a quantifier ("of"), another determiner ("the") and a noun ("book"). The sentence conveys a clear meaning as well: it tells us that someone (the speaker) has read part of a specific book. Therefore, there's no error related to syntax, semantics or morphology.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Most of the fruit is rotten" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "most of the fruit", which is a determiner phrase acting as the subject. The verb is "is", which agrees with its singular subject in number. The predicate is "rotten". Therefore, there are no syntax errors in this sentence.
0	Semantics	The sentence "Neither of students failed" is semantically incorrect because it lacks a clear subject and verb agreement. A more appropriate way to express the intended meaning would be "Neither student failed." Alternatively, if there are two groups being referred to, a possible correction could be "Neither group of students failed."
0	Syntax	In English, we use an article (a, an, or the) before uncountable nouns such as "water" when referring to a specific instance of it. The corrected sentence would be "I drank some **of the** water."
0	Semantics	The phrase "a golden hair" is syntactically and morphologically correct but semantically odd because it suggests that there is only one strand of gold-colored hair rather than describing the color of multiple hairs or something else as being golden. A more appropriate way to express this idea would be "golden hair" (without the indefinite article) if referring to many hairs or "a golden object" if referring to a single item with golden hair.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the rules for English syntax. It has a subject ("the boy"), a verb ("waved"), and an object ("to his father"). Additionally, there is proper modifier placement with "in the doorway" describing the location of "the boy."
1	Other Category	The sentence "That dog is so ferocious, it even tried to bite itself." is grammatically correct in terms of syntax, morphology, and semantics. However, the statement raises a biological question about whether a dog can physically turn its head around far enough to bite itself. Therefore, I would categorize this as an issue related to other categories rather than syntax, semantics, or morphology since the grammar is correct but the content raises some doubts.
0	Syntax	The verb "wash" requires an object in the objective case, but "yourself" is a reflexive pronoun in the reflexive case. In this context, we need to use the accusative form "you", so the correct sentence is "He washed you." or "He washed himself.", depending on who performed the action and for whom it was done.
0	Syntax	The sentence "John is easy to please Kim" is grammatically incorrect because it lacks a preposition such as 'for' or 'of' after 'easy'. A correct version would be "John is easy for/to please (by) Kim".
0	Syntax	The sentence seems to be missing a noun after "intelligent." A more complete version could be "There seemed to be an intelligent person (or thing) there," where "person" or "thing" is the required noun. In its current form, without a specific subject, it's grammatically incomplete.
1	Syntax	The sentence "John tried to please Stephen" is grammatically correct. In terms of syntax, it follows the standard structure of a sentence with a subject (John), an auxiliary verb (tried), a main verb in its infinitive form (to please) and an object (Stephen).
0	Semantics	This sentence is semantically incorrect because it states an impossible concept - believing a person (John) to be an inanimate object (a fountain). Additionally, associating a human with an object found in a park does not make logical sense.
1	Syntax	The sentence "It tries to leave the country." is grammatically correct in terms of syntax. Syntax refers to the arrangement of words to create meaningful sentences. In this case, the subject ("it") is followed by a verb phrase ("tries to leave") and an object ("the country"). All elements are correctly arranged, so the sentence can be understood without any difficulty.
1	Syntax	The sentence "John tries to leave the country." is grammatically correct. In this sentence, "tries" is a verb in the third person singular present tense, so it takes an -s ending. This shows that the speaker is using standard English morphology. Additionally, the syntax of the sentence follows standard English rules for word order, with the subject ("John") coming before the verb ("tries"), and the infinitive phrase "to leave the country" functioning as the direct object. Overall, this sentence exhibits no semantic or syntactic errors, making it a grammatically correct English sentence.
1	Other Category	The sentence "Under the bed seems to be a fun place to hide" is grammatically correct but semantically questionable because typically, it's unlikely for a location (under the bed) to have sensory perception or volition as implied by the phrase "seems to be." However, since there is no clear-cut rule violated here, we can assume that the intended meaning is something along the lines of "It seems that under the bed is a fun place to hide," making it an issue related to pragmatics rather than grammar or morphology.
0	Semantics	The verb "is" or "are" needs to be added before "believed" to make the subject agree with the verb in number. Additionally, the word "sheep" should be plural since it refers to more than one animal. A correct version would be: "It is believed there are sheep in the park." However, even after making these changes, the sentence remains semantically unclear as it lacks information about who holds the belief.
0	Syntax	In English, we use "will" instead of "would" for future tense when expressing personal choices or decisions. Therefore, the correct formulation of the sentence is: "I hope to **will** study in France." However, it's more common to say "I hope to study in France," without using any auxiliary verb before "study".
1	Syntax	The sentence "John can kick the ball" is grammatically correct in terms of syntax because it follows a proper structure with a subject ("John"), an auxiliary verb ("can"), and an object ("the ball"). Additionally, each word used is appropriate for its intended purpose within the context of the sentence.
0	Syntax	In English, we cannot use the verb 'rain' in the active voice with a subject (in this case 'John'). Rain is an impersonal verb that does not have a doer or subject; it simply happens. The correct way to phrase this idea would be to say "It will rain tomorrow."
0	Syntax	In English grammar, we use "is going to" or simply "will" to express future tense, but not both together. So, a more grammatically correct way to phrase the statement would be "We expect it to rain." or "We expect there to rain.", although in the latter case using "rain" without an article might sound slightly off.
1	Syntax	The sentence "John was found in the office." is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "John", and the verb is "was found". The preposition "in" introduces the prepositional phrase "in the office," which modifies the verb by telling us where John was found. This type of construction is a common way to express location or position in English, so there are no syntax errors in this sentence.
0	Syntax	In English, we use the auxiliary verb "do" (or its forms does, did) with a main verb in the base form to create questions or negations in the present simple tense. The correct way to ask this question would be "Does the child be in the school?" but even then, it's more common to say "Is the child at school?".
1	Syntax	The sentence "It did not rain" is grammatically correct. The subject pronoun "it" refers to the weather, and "did not rain" is the verb phrase in past tense. The negative marker "not" correctly negates the verb "rain". Therefore, there is no syntax error in this sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence "John wants not to leave the town" is grammatically correct but has a double negative which can lead to confusion in meaning (it could mean either John doesn't want to leave or John wants to stay). However, it follows the rules of syntax as negatives can be expressed using "not" or other negative words in English.
1	Other Category	The sentence "Mary likes to tour art galleries, but Bill hates to" is grammatically correct in terms of syntax, morphology, and semantics. Therefore, it falls under the category of "Other". It expresses a clear comparison between two people's preferences using appropriate grammatical structures such as parallelism (tour vs hate) and coordination (but).
1	Syntax	The sentence "They needn't take this exam" is grammatically correct in English. Here, "needn't" is a contraction of "do not need," indicating negation. Therefore, the sentence means "It is not necessary for them to take this exam." In terms of syntax, the sentence structure is correct with the subject ("they"), auxiliary verb ("needn't"), main verb ("take"), object ("this exam") all arranged correctly according to English grammar rules.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Ann may spend her vacation in Italy." is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Ann", a proper noun. The modal verb "may" indicates possibility or permission. The main verb "spend" agrees with its singular subject "Ann". "Her" refers back to the subject pronoun. Finally, "vacation" is a noun indicating an extended period of leisure and recreation, while "in Italy" specifies where she plans to go for her vacation. Therefore, there are no syntax errors in this sentence.
1	Other Category	The sentence "They love to play golf, but I do not." is grammatically correct in terms of syntax (word order), morphology (word forms) and semantics (meaning). Therefore, it falls under the "Other Category" as there is no specific error or issue with the sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence "George has spent a lot of money, hasn't he?" is grammatically correct in English. It follows the rules for subject-auxiliary verb inversion in tag questions, where the auxiliary verb "has" comes before the subject pronoun "he". Additionally, there are no spelling, punctuation, or grammatical errors in the sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence "As a statesman, scarcely could he do anything worth mentioning" is grammatically correct. Here, "scarcely" is used as an adverb modifying the verb phrase "could do." This construction creates a subordinating conjunction introducing a clause that describes a limiting circumstance for the main clause "he do anything worth mentioning." Although it may seem unusual or old-fashioned in modern usage, it is still considered grammatically valid.
1	Syntax	The sentence "We never found any of the unicorns" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules for subject-verb agreement (the plural subject "unicorns" matches with the plural verb "found") and word order in English sentences. Additionally, the use of the article "the" before "unicorns" indicates that these unicorns have been previously mentioned or are known to the listener/reader, which is appropriate in context.
1	Other Category	The sentence is grammatically correct but includes an incomplete thought, as it does not specify what “these lines” refers to. A more complete version could be: “One of Korea’s most famous pots wrote these lines of poetry.” However, without additional context or information about what specific lines the sentence is referring to, it is difficult to definitively say whether the sentence is semantically correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Somebody apparently struck the unidentified victim during the early morning hours" appears to be grammatically correct in terms of syntax. In this context, there are no missing or extra words, and each word seems to fit into its appropriate place within a phrase or clause. Additionally, the verb tense is consistent throughout the sentence, with all actions taking place in the past (e.g., "struck," "was"). Overall, I would rate this sentence as being syntactically correct.
1	Syntax	This English sentence is grammatically correct. The past tense of the verb "to drive" (drove) agrees with the subject "the car," and the word order follows standard English syntax rules for a simple sentence in the past tense.
1	Other Category	The sentence "Ricky can be relied on" is grammatically correct in standard English. Here, "can be relied on" is a passive construction used to express ability or possibility. It means that someone has the capacity to rely on Ricky because he is trustworthy. Therefore, there's no issue with syntax, semantics, or morphology here.
1	Syntax	The sentence "The bed was slept in" is grammatically correct. Here, the verb phrase "was slept in" follows a passive voice construction where the subject ("the bed") receives the action denoted by the past participle form of the verb ("slept"). This type of structure is commonly used in English when the focus is on the object or recipient of an action rather than the doer of the action.
0	Semantics	The sentence "A pound was weighed by the book" contains a semantic error because it is illogical to say that a unit of weight (a pound) can be weighed by a book. Weighing something involves measuring its weight using a scale or another weighing device, not a book. Therefore, the sentence does not make sense in an actual context.
1	Semantics	The sentence "Who do you think Tom saw?" is grammatically correct in English. It has a question form with an auxiliary verb "do" followed by another auxiliary verb "think." This structure creates a dependent clause expressing the speaker's uncertainty or doubt about something. Following this is the main clause headed by the verb "saw," indicating what the person being questioned might be unsure about. Overall, the syntax is sound. However, semantically speaking, it lacks context for specifying whom Tom could have seen, so while the sentence itself is fine, its meaning depends on external information not provided within the statement.
1	Syntax	The sentence "he had spent five thousand dollars" is grammatically correct in terms of syntax. In other words, it follows the rules for word order and arrangement in a sentence. Here, the subject "he" comes first, followed by the auxiliary verb "had," then the past participle "spent," and finally the object of the sentence "five thousand dollars." Therefore, there are no syntactical errors in this sentence.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a pronoun ambiguity error. It's unclear whether "her" refers to "Fed" or some other female person in the context. A corrected version could be: "Fed knows which politician to vote for." or "Fed knows whom she should vote for."
1	Semantics	The sentence "How did you guess that he fixed the computer?" is grammatically correct but semantically odd because guessing typically involves uncertainty or doubt about an outcome, while fixing a computer implies certainty that it has been repaired. A more appropriate question might be "How did you know that he fixed the computer?" if the speaker wants to inquire about how the information was obtained. However, since the prompt only asks for grammaticality judgment without contextual interpretation, I will assume that the sentence is used as a hypothetical example rather than a real utterance.
1	Syntax	This English sentence is grammatically correct. Here's why: * The subject of the sentence is "the committee," which is a singular noun. * The verb "knows" agrees with the subject in number (singular) and tense (present). * The relative clause "whose efforts to achieve peace" modifies the object of the sentence, "whom the world should honor." * The pronoun "whom" is correctly used as the object of the preposition "of." * The sentence expresses a clear idea without any ambiguity or confusion. Therefore, I would classify this sentence as syntactically correct because it follows all the rules of grammar related to word order, agreement, and structure.
0	Syntax	The sentence "Which house does your friend live?" is grammatically incorrect because it lacks a verb for the subject "your friend." A more appropriate way to phrase the question would be "In which house does your friend live?" or "Which house does your friend live in?"
1	Syntax	The sentence "the baker from whom I bought these bagels left" is grammatically correct. It uses a relative clause ("from whom I bought these bagels") to modify the noun phrase ("the baker"). This type of construction is called a "wh-relative clause," and it is used to provide additional information about the noun phrase. In this case, the wh-word "who" has been replaced by the preposition "from" and the relative pronoun "whom." This is a common and acceptable way to form a relative clause in English.
1	Other Category	The sentence "I found the place where we can relax." is grammatically correct in terms of syntax, morphology, and semantics. Therefore, it falls under the category of "Other" as there is no specific error or issue with the sentence.
0	Syntax	The phrase "in love with" is redundant because when using the preposition "with", it already implies the idea of feeling something towards someone or something. So, the correct form would be "Jack is the person with whom Jenny fell in love."
1	Other Category	The sentence “There is a bench to sit on” is grammatically correct and conveys a clear meaning. It can be understood as an existential statement indicating the presence of a bench suitable for sitting. No issues in syntax, semantics or morphology are present in this sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence "I met the man who grows peaches" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "I", followed by a verb phrase "met". The object is "the man who grows peaches", where "who grows peaches" is a relative clause modifying "man". This type of construction is commonly used in English to provide additional information about a noun or pronoun. Therefore, it is syntactically correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a misplaced modifier error. The phrase "without getting his approval" is modifying "which topic," but it makes more sense for it to modify the action of choosing. To fix this issue, we could rephrase the sentence as follows: "I chose a topic without getting his approval." Alternatively, if the intended meaning was that the topic itself didn't have his approval, we would need to add additional context or phrasing to make this clear. For example: "The topic I chose was one he had not approved."
0	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically incomplete and lacks a necessary preposition such as "of" or "with" after the word "bored." A more complete version could be "Which topic did you get bored with because Mary talked about it?" or "Which topic did you get bored due to Mary's talking about it?"
1	Other Category	The sentence "That is the reason why he resigned." is grammatically correct. It has a subject ("that"), an auxiliary verb ("is"), a predicate noun ("the reason"), a subordinating conjunction ("why"), another subject ("he"), and a main verb in past tense ("resigned"). Therefore, there are no syntax, semantic or morphological errors in this sentence.
1	Other Category	The sentence "It bothers me that John coughs" is grammatically correct. Therefore, we can assign it a value of 1. As for its categorization, since there are no syntactic, semantic or morphological issues with the sentence, I would place it in an "Other Category." This category could include things such as pragmatics (the way context contributes to meaning) or discourse analysis (how multiple sentences contribute to larger units of meaning). However, without further information about what specific categories have been requested, I will simply use "Other Category" as a catch-all term for any issue that doesn't fall under syntax, semantics, or morphology. In this case, the sentence seems to be expressing some degree of annoyance at John's behavior, so perhaps it falls under pragmatics or discourse analysis. But again, without more context, it's difficult to say for sure.
0	Syntax	The sentence "To please John is easy" is grammatically incorrect because it lacks a proper subject-verb agreement. A better way to phrase the sentence would be "It is easy to please John." In the original sentence, "to please John" acts as an infinitive verb phrase but there's no explicit subject for it to agree with, so adding "it" helps resolve the issue.
1	Other Category	The sentence "Kim is eager to please Tom." is grammatically correct and has a clear meaning, so it would be understood by native speakers. Therefore, there is no error in syntax, semantics or morphology.
0	Semantics	The sentence "That we invaded Iraq really bites" is grammatically correct but semantically odd because it uses the colloquial expression "bites," which typically refers to a negative experience or situation, in reference to an event that happened in the past (the invasion of Iraq). It would be more appropriate to use a different wording to express disappointment or regret about the event, such as "It's unfortunate that we invaded Iraq."
1	Other Category	The sentence "It annoys me that Fido barks" is grammatically correct in standard English. Therefore, it returns a label of 1 indicating that the sentence is correct. Additionally, since there are no syntax, semantic, or morphological errors present, it falls under the category of 'Other.' No further explanation for incorrectness is necessary as the sentence is indeed correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Who achieved the best result was Angela" is grammatically correct. It has a subject ("who"), an auxiliary verb ("was"), and a predicate nominative ("Angela"). Although some people might prefer using "that" instead of "who", both words can be used interchangeably in this context without affecting grammaticality. Therefore, I will assign it a score of 1 for being grammatically correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "It was the peasant girl who got it" is grammatically correct. In this sentence, "it" is a pronoun that refers to something previously mentioned or known from context; "was" is an auxiliary verb used in passive voice; "the peasant girl" is a noun phrase acting as the subject complement, where "peasant girl" is a common noun modified by the adjective "peasant"; "who" introduces a relative clause modifying "girl," making clear which person we're referring to; and "got" is the main verb of the sentence in past tense form.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains two errors in subject-verb agreement. The first error occurs in the phrase "That kind of person is", where "is" does not agree with its plural subject "kind of person". A correction could be made by saying "Those kinds of people are..." instead. The second error occurs later in the sentence with the verb "to find". Here, it appears as if there might be a missing word (e.g., "It's hard to find anyoneto look after that kind of person"), but even then the use of "anyone" would still need to change because "find" requires an object pronoun such as "somebody." Therefore, a better way to construct this sentence would be something along the lines of "Finding someone to take care of that sort of person can be difficult."
1	Semantics	The sentence "A sick owl doesn't hunt mice." is grammatically correct in English. In terms of semantics, it means that a particular owl that is feeling unwell does not engage in hunting mice, which makes sense as an idea. Therefore, I would classify this statement as having no issues with syntax, morphology, or any other category; it is simply expressing a coherent thought about the world.
1	Semantics	The sentence appears grammatically correct, but it contains a logical error related to semantics. Specifically, the phrase "each candidate who has interest in semantics" suggests that each individual candidate possesses an interest in semantics as opposed to multiple candidates having interests in various fields including semantics. A more accurate way to express this idea would be "Candidates with an interest in semantics will be admitted to the department."
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct. It has a subject ("each author"), a verb ("will provide"), and an object ("a summary"). Additionally, it includes the preposition "in" followed by its object ("any language other than English") and a relative clause "whose contribution is written," modifying the noun phrase "each author." Overall, the syntax follows standard English rules for word order and structure.
1	Semantics	The sentence "I'm sure we even got these tickets!" is grammatically correct in English. However, it might be semantically incorrect depending on the context. The word "even" implies a contrast or emphasis, but there is no clear comparison being made in this statement. So if used out of context, it may sound unusual, however, it could still make sense in certain situations where a speaker wants to emphasize their possession or acquisition of the tickets.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a double negative ("even" and "got"), which can lead to confusion in meaning and violates standard English usage. Correcting it would result in either "I'm sure we have these tickets!" or "I'm not sure we got these tickets!", depending on the intended message.
1	Semantics	The sentence is grammatically correct, but there is a spelling error in the word "guerrillas" which should be spelled as "guerillas". However, since the intended meaning can still be understood from the context, it does not significantly affect the semantic interpretation of the sentence.
1	Semantics	The sentence appears grammatically correct but its meaning implies a cause-effect relationship between two events (Sue saying something bad and the speaker being angry) that contradicts what the speaker actually intends to convey - i.e., that there is no such causal link. This subtler aspect of language falls under semantics, or the study of meaning in language. In other words, while syntactically sound, the sentence contains an error in logical coherence, making it semantically incorrect.
1	Syntax	The sentence "That he was hungry, John whined" is grammatically correct. It consists of two independent clauses ("that he was hungry" and "John whined") connected by a comma, which is a common way to join related ideas in English. This construction is called a compound sentence. Each clause has its own subject and predicate, with the first clause acting as a noun clause modifying the second clause. Therefore, there is no error in syntax or grammar.
0	Syntax	The sentence "1 gave Mary after the party a book." is grammatically incorrect due to improper word order. In English, the basic syntactic structure for a simple sentence is subject-verb-object (SVO). However, in this case, there seems to be an attempt to list all nouns first before verbs, making it difficult to identify the subject or object easily. A corrected version could be "I gave Mary a book after the party" or even "After the party, I gave Mary a book".
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a comma splice error. It can be corrected by changing it to two separate sentences or connecting them with a conjunction such as "so" or "and". For example: "Because she's so pleasant, I really like Mary." Or "She's so pleasant, so I really like Mary."
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the first clause is "he", the verb is "may hate", and the object is "those that criticize Carter". The second clause has a subject-verb agreement with "it" as the subject and "doesn't matter" as the verb phrase. Additionally, there is a coordinating conjunction "and" linking the two clauses together. Therefore, the syntax of the sentence is correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains an error in subject-verb agreement. In English, a singular subject requires a singular verb form. Here, the subject "John" is singular but the verb "would be" is in plural form. A corrected version could read: "Without a job, John wouldn't be happy."
0	Syntax	The correct form of this sentence should be "I have **much** *of* the manuscript **left** *to* type." or "I have a lot of the manuscript left to type.", because we use 'much' with uncountable nouns (e.g., water, money) while referring to an amount, whereas 'many' is used for countable nouns (e.g., books, apples) when talking about quantity. Additionally, after 'much', 'of' must be followed by a noun phrase as in this case ('the manuscript'). In our original sentence, using 'much' without 'of' makes it grammatically incorrect.
1	Syntax	The sentence "He's a more reliable man" is grammatically correct in English. Here, "he's" is a contraction for "he is," and it functions as the auxiliary verb (also known as a helping verb) in the present perfect continuous tense. The word "more" modifies the adjective "reliable." This type of construction is called comparative form, where we compare two things or people with each other. Finally, "man" serves as the subject complement. Therefore, there is no error in syntax.
0	Syntax	The sentence "Any trouble is what I don't want" is grammatically incorrect because it uses a negative form ("don't want") with a positive meaning. A correct way to express this idea would be "I don't want any trouble." In this corrected version, the negation applies to the verb "want," indicating that the speaker does not desire trouble.
1	Syntax	The sentence "They may grow as high as bamboo" is grammatically correct. The subject "they" refers to some entities that can grow, followed by a modal verb "may", then the base form "grow". Finally, there is an adverb phrase "as high as bamboo" modifying the verb "grow". This structure follows standard English syntax rules.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Some of them made as many errors as 20." contains a syntax error because the number "20" cannot be compared with "as many errors". A corrected version could be "Some of them made up to 20 errors." or "Their error count was as high as 20.", depending on what exactly is meant by the original statement.
0	Syntax	The pronoun used in this sentence, "himself," does not agree with the subject "Sally." In English, reflexive pronouns such as "myself," "yourself," "herself," "itself," "ourselves," "yourselves," and "themselves" must match the gender and number of their antecedent (the word they refer back to). Since "Sally" is a female singular noun, the correct form would be "she kissed herself."
1	Syntax	The sentence "Drew believes I think Rosie loves magazine ads." is grammatically correct in terms of syntax because it follows the rules for word order and structure in English. However, there may be some confusion about who has what belief since both "believes" and "thinks" indicate a belief held by someone. It might be clearer if rephrased as "Drew thinks I believe Rosie loves magazine ads," or "I think Drew believes Rosie loves magazine ads."
1	Syntax	The sentence "Dave, Dan, Erin, Jaime, and Alina left" is grammatically correct. It follows the standard structure of a simple sentence, consisting of a subject ("Dave, Dan, Erin, Jaime, and Alina") and a verb ("left"). Additionally, all elements in the subject are separated by commas, making it clear who the actors in the sentence are. Overall, there are no syntax errors present in this sentence.
1	Other Category	The sentence "Hopefully, we'll make it through the winter without snow." is grammatically correct. It contains an adverb ("hopefully") at the beginning of the sentence, a subject pronoun ("we"), an auxiliary verb ("will"), a main verb ("make"), a preposition ("through"), another noun phrase ("the winter"), and a negative time expression ("without snow"). All these elements combine to form a grammatical sentence with a clear meaning and structure. Therefore, there is no error in syntax, semantics, or morphology.
0	Syntax	In the sentence "Blue leather shows herself that Betsy is pretty," there are several syntax errors. The subject-verb agreement is incorrect as "blue leather" cannot show anything. Additionally, it is unclear what "herself" refers to in this context. A corrected version could be "Betsy's blue leather shoes demonstrate how pretty she is."
1	Syntax	The sentence "Gwen hit the baseball" is grammatically correct in terms of syntax. In this context, the subject (Gwen) performs an action (hit) on a direct object (the baseball), making it syntactically well-formed.
0	Syntax	The sentence "I hit that you knew the answer" is grammatically incorrect because the pronoun "that" is being used as a direct object instead of a clause. A more appropriate way to phrase the sentence would be "I hit upon the fact that you knew the answer."
1	Other Category	The sentence "I've lost my wallet or I've lost my mind" is grammatically correct. However, it contains a coordination with two independent clauses but no conjunction between them. A more complete version would be "I've lost my wallet, or I've lost my mind." In informal speech, people often omit words for brevity, so in this case, we can still say that the sentence is grammatically correct even though it lacks the word 'but'.
1	Other Category	The sentence "It was a brand new car that he bought" is grammatically correct. The subject-verb agreement is maintained throughout the sentence as 'it' agrees with 'was', and 'car' agrees with 'he bought'. Additionally, the word order follows standard English rules for declarative sentences (SVO). Moreover, the use of determiners ('a') before nouns ('brand new car'), adjectives ('new') modifying nouns ('car'), and relative clauses ("that he bought") all contribute positively towards making it an acceptable sentence in terms of morphological structure and semantic meaning. Therefore, no issues related to syntax, semantics or morphology can be identified here; hence we categorize it under other category since there isn't any specific error type found.
1	Syntax	The sentence "He likes cookies and he hates crumb cake." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of English syntax. Each clause in the sentence has a subject ("he") and a predicate verb ("likes" or "hates"), and they are connected by the conjunction "and". Additionally, each clause contains a noun phrase ("cookies" or "crumb cake") as its direct object, making the overall structure (S + V + NP) clear for both clauses.
1	Syntax	The sentence "They chased the man with the car" is grammatically correct. Here, "they" is the subject, "chased" is the verb, and "the man with the car" is the object. Although there can be ambiguity about whether "with the car" describes how they chased or what they used to chase, syntactically it's still valid.
1	Other Category	The phrase "I didn't have a red cent" is an idiomatic expression in English that means the speaker had no money. Therefore, it is grammatically correct but relies on understanding the meaning behind the words used.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains two independent clauses ("the book of poems takes a very long time to read" and "from Blackwell") but lacks proper conjunction or punctuation to connect them, leading to a syntactically incorrect structure.
1	Syntax	The sentence "the one with a red cover takes a very long time to read" is grammatically correct. It follows standard English syntax rules for word order and structure in a sentence. Therefore, it returns 1 indicating that it's correct.
1	Other Category	The sentence "John has a fear of dogs." is grammatically correct and meaningful in English. Here, 'fear' is used as a noun indicating an emotion or feeling, so it does not belong to syntax, semantics, or morphology errors. Therefore, we can categorize it under other category with a label of 1 for being grammatically correct.
0	Syntax	In this sentence, there are two noun phrases "the building" and "the roof", with each having its own article ("the"). However, in English grammar, only one article is needed before multiple nouns if they refer to the same entity or concept. Therefore, a more appropriate way to phrase the sentence would be "The building's roof is leaking," without the second article.
0	Syntax	In English, we do not use two articles ("the") back-to-back like in the given sentence "the panther's the coat". It would be grammatically correct to say either "the panther's coat is dark black" or "the panther has a dark black coat", where only one article is used before "coat."
1	Syntax	The sentence "Colin asked if they could get a mortgage" is grammatically correct. The subject of the main clause is "Colin," who is asking a question using the modal verb "could." This construction follows standard English syntax rules for forming questions. Additionally, there are no errors in word choice or agreement, making the sentence free from morphological issues as well.
0	Semantics	This sentence contains a garden path effect, where it initially leads us to interpret the sentence in one way ("the man" as the subject), but then we realize later on in the sentence that our initial interpretation was incorrect ("the man" is actually the object). Here, the problem lies with the semantics of the sentence - the meaning conveyed by the sentence is ambiguous due to its structure. It's possible that there are two people involved here - the man who got into the cab and someone else who robbed the bank. However, without further context or clarification, the sentence implies that the same person both got into the cab and robbed the bank, which is unlikely and contradictory. A clearer version could be something like "The man I saw rob the bank had gotten into a cab earlier."
1	Syntax	The sentence "I know you eat asparagus." is grammatically correct in terms of syntax because it follows the rules for word order and structure in English. The subject ("I") comes first, followed by a verb ("know"), then an object ("you"), another verb ("eat"), and finally the direct object ("asparagus").
1	Syntax	The sentence "John's drum will always bother me" is grammatically correct in terms of syntax because it follows the standard structure of a sentence with a subject ("John's drum"), a helping verb ("will"), a main verb ("bother"), and an object ("me"). Additionally, the possessive form "John's" correctly modifies the noun "drum."
1	Syntax	The sentence "An evil thought struck Dave" is grammatically correct in terms of syntax as it follows the standard structure of a sentence with a subject ("an evil thought"), verb ("struck") and object ("Dave"). Additionally, each word is correctly conjugated for tense and number, and they all work together to form a coherent idea. Therefore, there are no syntactic errors present in this sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence "In the classroom John put the book on the table." is grammatically correct in terms of syntax as it follows standard English sentence structure (Subject-Verb-Object).
1	Syntax	The sentence "Phillip gave the medal to the soldier" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Phillip", who performed the action "gave". The direct object of the verb is "the medal", which was given by Philip. Finally, "to the soldier" indicates the indirect object or recipient of the gift. Therefore, it follows proper syntax rules for an English sentence.
0	Syntax	The verb "to eat" in this context requires a subject and an object. In this case, the subject is missing. It should be "Andy eats," or more naturally, "Heidi thinks that Andy will eat salmon-flavored candy bars." Also, it's worth noting that "salmon flavored" should probably be hyphenated as "salmon-flavored".
1	Semantics	The sentence "Heidi thinks that Andy should eat salmon flavored candy bars" is grammatically correct in terms of syntax (word order) and morphology (word forms). However, semantically (meaning), it's a bit unusual for candy bars to be flavored with fish such as salmon. But since we cannot rule out this possibility based on linguistic grounds alone, I will assume that the sentence is grammatical and meaningful, albeit unconventional or humorous. Therefore, my response is 1, indicating that the sentence is correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "He danced." is grammatically correct. The subject "he" agrees with the verb in number, and the verb "danced" is in the past tense. Additionally, there are no missing or extra words, and the word order is correct. Therefore, it is a well-formed sentence in English syntax.
0	Syntax	The sentence "Did Calvin his homework?" is grammatically incorrect because it lacks a helping verb between "Calvin" and "his". A proper question in English would be formed as "Did Calvin do his homework?" or "Has Calvin done his homework?" In the first example, "do" is used as an auxiliary (helping) verb for present tense questions; in the second example, "has" serves as an auxiliary verb for perfect aspect questions.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Sylvia was slapping Jeff upside the head in martial arts class" is grammatically correct. The syntax follows the standard structure of a sentence with a subject ("Sylvia"), verb ("was slapping"), and object ("Jeff"). Additionally, the prepositional phrase "upside the head" modifies the verb, clarifying where Sylvia was slapping Jeff. Finally, the clause "in martial arts class" further specifies when or where the action took place. Overall, the sentence has proper syntax without any errors.
1	Other Category	The sentence “If I am a rich man, I’d buy a diamond ring” is grammatically correct and conveys a clear meaning (semantically correct). It does not have any issues with word formation or inflection (morphologically correct), so we don’t need to consider those categories here. Instead, this falls into an ‘Other Category’, as it doesn’t fit neatly into syntax, semantics, or morphology. In this case, since the sentence follows standard English conventions for grammar, vocabulary, and punctuation, there isn’t really anything else to discuss.
1	Other Category	The sentence "If he were a rich man, he'd buy a diamond ring" is grammatically correct. It contains an example of second conditional structure in English language where we use past simple tense after if (were) + subject and would + infinitive for the main clause. Here, 'he were' refers to an imaginary or unlikely situation in the present time. Therefore, it doesn't fall under any specific category such as syntax, semantics or morphology but can be categorized as other.
1	Syntax	The sentence "John is likely to leave" is grammatically correct. In this sentence, "is" serves as an auxiliary verb (also known as a helping verb), connecting the subject "John" with the adjective phrase "likely to leave." This structure creates a grammatical construction called a predicate adjective, in which an adjective follows a linking verb and describes the subject. Therefore, there is no syntax error in this sentence.
1	Syntax	This English sentence is grammatically correct because it follows standard subject-verb agreement rules in English (the singular subject "manager" matches with the singular verb "laughed"). Additionally, the word order is correct, making the sentence easy to understand.
0	Syntax	The sentence "Was sunk." is grammatically incomplete as it lacks a proper subject or noun phrase before the verb tense "was sunk". A complete sentence requires both a subject and a predicate (verb) for clarity and understanding. For example, a valid sentence could be "The ship was sunk by the enemy.", where "The ship" serves as the subject and "was sunk by the enemy" serves as the predicate.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains an incorrect use of tense. The auxiliary verb "did" is used with "think," but it should be used with the past participle form of the main verb in order to form a question. In addition, there is no need for another auxiliary verb "did" before the verb "kissed." A correct version would be: "Who did you think kissed the gorilla?" or simply "Who thought kissed the gorilla?"
1	Other Category	The sentence "Have you seen my model airplane collection?" is grammatically correct and meaningful in English. Therefore, it does not have any issues with syntax (word order), semantics (meaning), or morphology (word forms). Hence, we can classify its correctness under an "Other Category" label.
1	Semantics	The sentence "It seems that Lucy was mugged" appears to be grammatically correct in terms of syntax (word order) and morphology (word forms). However, semantically it suggests a level of uncertainty about what happened to Lucy, as if there's only suspicion or conjecture regarding her being mugged but no definitive evidence. Nonetheless, I will assume the intent here is simply to construct a grammatically valid sentence rather than conveying specific information, so I am classifying this under 'Semantics' due to its inherent ambiguity.
1	Syntax	The sentence "I ate a salad that was filled with lima beans" is grammatically correct in terms of syntax because it follows the rules for constructing an English sentence. It has a subject ("I"), a verb ("ate"), and an object ("salad"). Additionally, there is a relative clause modifying the noun phrase "a salad," which adds more information about what kind of salad it was. This clause is introduced by the word "that" and includes its own subject ("was") and predicate ("filled with lima beans"). All these elements form a coherent structure and convey a clear meaning, making the sentence syntactically correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "There were four men arriving at the station when I pulled up." is grammatically correct. The subject-auxiliary inversion ("were there") has been used correctly in the subordinate clause indicating a time overlap between two events (the arrival of the men and pulling up). All other grammatical components such as nouns, verbs, adjectives, prepositions, and conjunctions have been used appropriately.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Jean is reluctant to dance" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Jean," which is a proper noun and the simple present tense verb "is" indicates the third person singular form. The adjective "reluctant" correctly modifies the pronoun "to." The infinitive phrase "to dance" functions as the direct object of the sentence and completes the meaning of the sentence by telling what Jean is reluctant to do. Therefore, there are no errors in syntax or any other aspect of grammar.
1	Syntax	The sentence "I want her to dance" is grammatically correct in English. In terms of syntax, it follows a subject-verb-object pattern with an embedded infinitive phrase ("to dance") as the direct object. Additionally, the verb "want" takes a clausal complement, making the entire clause "her to dance" a subordinate clause functioning as the direct object. All pronouns (I, her) agree in number with their respective antecedents, and there are no missing or extra words.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Jean persuaded Robert." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a simple sentence in English (Subject-Verb-Object). Here, 'Jean' is the subject, 'persuaded' is the verb, and 'Robert' is the object of the sentence. Additionally, all words used in the sentence are spelled correctly and there are no missing or extra punctuation marks.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Jean wants Bill to do the Macarena" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of English syntax. In this sentence, "Jean" is the subject, "wants" is the verb, and "Bill to do the Macarena" is the object. This structure is a common pattern in English sentences, making it syntactically correct.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the subject-verb-object (SVO) word order in English. "The children" is the subject, "admire" is the verb, and "their mother" is the object. Additionally, all words are used appropriately within the context of the sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Who has Peter talked with?" is grammatically correct in English. It follows the standard structure for a question by inverting the order of the auxiliary verb ("has") and subject pronoun ("Peter"). This type of construction is used to ask questions about the identity or nature of an unknown entity (in this case, the person who spoke with Peter). Therefore, there are no syntax errors present in this sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Heidi likes her violin" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Heidi", a proper noun in the nominative case. The verb of the sentence is "likes", an third-person singular present tense verb which agrees with the subject "Heidi". The object of the sentence is "her violin", where "violin" is a noun in the accusative case indicating it's being acted upon by the verb "likes." Overall, the syntax follows standard English rules for word order and agreement between subject and verb.
0	Syntax	The error in this sentence lies in the use of the reflexive pronoun "himself". In this case, it should be "he" instead because it refers back to the subject of the embedded clause ("John") rather than the object ("Mary"). So a grammatically correct version would be: "John thinks that Mary loves him."
0	Syntax	The question is grammatically incorrect because it uses a reflexive pronoun (himself) without an antecedent in the same clause. A better way to phrase the question would be "Which pictures of him does John like?" or "Which pictures of himself does John prefer?"
0	Semantics	The sentence "Any owl hunts mice" contains a logical error in its generalization of all owls as always hunting mice. While many species of owls do hunt small mammals such as mice, it is incorrect to claim that every individual owl does so without exception. This type of error falls under semantic issues because the meaning conveyed by the statement goes beyond what can be accurately described for the entire group based on typical behavior.
0	Syntax	The sentence "Any man didn't eat dinner" contains a negative quantifier "any", but it is used incorrectly with the past tense verb form "didn't". A better way to phrase this would be "No man ate dinner." or "Did any man eat dinner?" for a question.
1	Other Category	The sentence "A pilot could be flying this plane" is grammatically correct. It has a subject ("a pilot"), an auxiliary verb ("could"), the main verb in its base form ("be"), another verb conjugated with "-ing" for continuous tense ("flying") and an object ("this plane"). All elements are coherent semantically as well. Therefore, it falls under other category since there's no syntax, morphology or semantic error.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct. Here, the clause "whoever they were" is a relative clause modifying the subject "everybody." It renames the antecedent "everybody" with a pronoun "they," making it clear that multiple people are being referred to. This construction is called a free relative clause, which functions as a noun phrase in the matrix sentence. Additionally, there is no ambiguity regarding the meaning or structure of the sentence. Therefore, the syntax is correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Anybody who attended last week's huge rally signed the petition" is grammatically correct. It has a clear subject ("anybody who attended last week's huge rally") and predicate ("signed the petition"). The verb tense is consistent throughout the sentence, with both clauses using the past tense. Additionally, the use of punctuation is appropriate. Therefore, I would classify this as a syntactically correct sentence.
1	Semantics	The sentence "Any tiger has orange fur, marked with black stripes." is grammatically correct but contains a semantic error. In reality, it's false to say "any" tiger because there are no exceptions when describing tigers; they all have orange fur and black stripes. It would be more accurate to use "all" or "every," e.g., "All tigers have orange fur, marked with black stripes."
0	Semantics	This statement is a contradiction because it says that any albino tiger has orange fur, but by definition an albino animal lacks typical pigmentation so its fur would be white or very light colored instead of orange.
1	Syntax	The sentence "You must pick any flower you see." is grammatically correct in terms of syntax as it follows standard English grammar rules for word order, tense, and subject-verb agreement.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Any pilot on duty today could be flying this plane" is grammatically correct in terms of syntax because it follows the rules for word order and structure in English. It contains a subject ("any pilot on duty today"), an auxiliary verb ("could"), a main verb ("be"), and an object ("this plane"). Additionally, there is proper use of articles and prepositions, making the overall flow of the sentence clear and coherent.
1	Semantics	The sentence is grammatically correct in English. The verb "pick" agrees with its plural subject "you," and the prepositional phrase "for Mary" correctly follows the verb "leave." Semantically, it means that the listener can pick as many flowers as they want, but they must ensure that some remain for Mary's benefit.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of syntax in English. Each clause contains a subject ("the Dodgers") and a verb ("beat" or "were beaten"), and they express complete thoughts. Additionally, there is no ambiguity in meaning due to proper word order and use of punctuation.
1	Syntax	The sentence "In which car was the man seen?" is grammatically correct in terms of syntax because it follows the rules for word order and structure in English. The sentence has a subject ("the man"), an auxiliary verb ("was"), a preposition ("in") introducing a prepositional phrase ("in which car"), and a main verb ("seen"). All these elements are arranged correctly, making the sentence syntactically correct.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct. It contains a complex subject ("the man who Mary loves and Sally hates") followed by a verb ("computed") and an object ("my tax"). While it might be unusual for someone's love or hate to affect their ability to compute taxes, there is nothing inherently incorrect about the syntax of this sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct in terms of syntax, as it follows the rules for word order and structure in English. It contains a subject ("the kennel"), verb ("has been stolen"), and an embedded relative clause ("which Mary made and Fido sleeps") that modifies the subject. All elements of the sentence are used correctly and form a coherent meaning.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Tom said he would and Bill actually did eat a raw eggplant" is grammatically correct. It contains two independent clauses joined by a coordinating conjunction ("and"), with appropriate punctuation (a comma) separating them. The first clause expresses that Tom made a statement about eating a raw eggplant in the future, while the second clause indicates that Bill carried out that action in reality.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of English syntax (word order). In this case, we have a subject ("the wealthy young man"), an action verb ("bought"), and an object ("that piano"). Additionally, there is a prepositional phrase modifying the direct object ("for his secret fiancée") indicating who the piano was purchased for.
1	Other Category	This English sentence is grammatically correct and meaningful. Therefore, it is labeled as 1 (correct). Its category can be classified under 'Other' since there does not seem to be any specific grammatical or linguistic issue to address in this sentence.
1	Other Category	The sentence "a tall building" is grammatically correct. It consists of an indefinite article "a" followed by an adjective "tall" describing the noun "building." Although the sentence is syntactically correct, it lacks context or a complete thought, making it difficult to determine if it has any semantic errors. However, as a standalone phrase, there are no apparent morphological, syntax, or semantic issues with it.
1	Other Category	The sentence "This building is tall" is grammatically correct and meaningful in English. Therefore, it receives a score of 1 for grammaticality. Since there are no apparent issues with syntax, semantics, or morphology, we can place this example under an "Other Category". In particular, this response does not involve any errors related to word choice, spelling, punctuation, capitalization, idiomatic expressions, etc., so it cannot be classified as belonging to a more specific category such as syntactic, semantic, or morphological error.
1	Syntax	The sentence "I like the book which you gave me" is grammatically correct. In this sentence, the subject is "I", the verb is "like", and the object is "the book". The clause "which you gave me" modifies the noun phrase "the book". This type of structure with a relative pronoun (in this case, "which") introducing an adjectival clause is common in English syntax. Therefore, there is no error in terms of syntax.
1	Other Category	The sentence "Captain Wentworth wrote a letter to Anne Elliott" is grammatically correct in terms of syntax, morphology, and semantics. Therefore, it falls under the category of "Other". In particular, there are no issues with subject-verb agreement, word choice, or tense consistency. Additionally, the meaning of the sentence can be understood easily without any ambiguity.
0	Syntax	In English, we use subject-auxiliary inversion (e.g., "was Alison" instead of "Alison was") only when forming questions or using certain constructions such as negation or emphasis. However, if a question has already been formed with an auxiliary verb ("did," "has," etc.), subsequent auxiliaries do not undergo inversion. Here, there's no need for inversion because the first word "asked" already implies a question through its tense change; thus, it should be "She asked **if** Alison was coming to the party."
1	Syntax	The sentence "They realized that never had Sir Thomas been so offended" is grammatically correct in formal written English, whereby it follows a complex sentence structure consisting of an independent clause ("They realized") and a subordinate clause ("that never had Sir Thomas been so offended"). Here, the use of the past perfect continuous tense ("had been so offended") conveys a sequence of events, emphasizing that Sir Thomas's offense occurred before another action (realization) took place. Hence, no correction is required for syntax errors.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Fanny regretted having to talk to Aunt Norris." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules for English syntax. Specifically, the subject ("Fanny") comes before the verb ("regretted"), and there is a proper noun followed by a gerund phrase ("talking to Aunt Norris"). This structure indicates that Fanny has some regret about an action or situation (having to talk to Aunt Norris). Overall, the sentence conveys its intended meaning effectively without any grammatical errors.
1	Other Category	The sentence "Knowing the country well, he took a shortcut" is grammatically correct. It contains an adverbial clause "Knowing the country well," which modifies the main clause "he took a shortcut." This type of construction is often used in written English to provide additional context or background information about the subject of the sentence. In this case, the adverbial clause implies that the person's knowledge of the country influenced their decision to take a shortcut. Therefore, there is no error in syntax, semantics, or morphology, so I have labeled it as belonging to the "Other Category".
1	Semantics	The sentence "He left the train with somebody else's wallet in his pocket" is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("he"), a verb ("left"), an object ("the train") and additional information about what he had in his pocket ("somebody else's wallet"). From a semantic perspective, it implies that he unintentionally took someone else's wallet without realizing or intending to do so.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Magnus went to Ireland" is grammatically correct. The subject "Magnus" agrees with the verb "went" in number (both singular), and the preposition "to" correctly introduces the location "Ireland." Therefore, there are no syntax errors in this sentence.
0	Syntax	The sentence "Who did John send the book?" has a syntax error because it lacks a proper question word order. A correct version would be "Who did John send the book to?" or "John sent the book to whom?"
1	Semantics	This sentence is grammatically correct but semantically odd because a physical object (the Dome) cannot be described as having the emotion of being dull or uninterested; rather, it can only have visual characteristics such as color or shape. Therefore, although the sentence follows syntactic rules for structure and form, its meaning is unusual in context.
0	Syntax	In English, when using the phrase "came right in," it implies that the subject performed the action (of entering) without hindrance or permission. However, placing "he" after "did" is incorrect because the word order should be "subject + verb + object." The corrected version would be: "He came right in without so much as a knock."
1	Syntax	The sentence "Harriet admired Mr Knightley" is grammatically correct in terms of syntax because it follows the standard structure of a simple sentence with a subject ("Harriet"), a verb ("admired") and an object ("Mr Knightley"). Additionally, each word is spelled correctly and there are no punctuation errors. Therefore, this sentence can be considered syntactically correct.
1	Other Category	This sentence is grammatically correct and its meaning is clear. It does not contain any errors in syntax, semantics or morphology. Therefore, it falls under the category of 'Other' as there are no specific issues with the sentence.
1	Other Category	The sentence "Ethel wishes to ask you some awkward questions." is grammatically correct. It has a subject ("Ethel"), a verb ("wishes"), and an object ("some awkward questions"). Additionally, the word order follows standard English rules and there are no misspelled words or incorrect punctuation marks. Therefore, it falls under the category of 'Other' as it does not contain any errors in syntax, semantics, or morphology.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Emma made Harriet some food" is grammatically correct in terms of syntax because it follows the rules for constructing a sentence in English. It has a subject ("Emma"), an auxiliary verb ("made"), a direct object ("Harriet") and an indirect object ("some food").
1	Syntax	This English sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an English sentence (Subject-Verb-Object), where "the window" is the subject, "was broken" is the verb phrase in passive voice, and "with a hammer" is a prepositional phrase providing additional information about how the action was performed.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct. It follows standard subject-verb-object word order (fugitive - lay - discovery), and uses appropriate verb tense (past tense) for the context of the sentence. Additionally, it contains an embedded clause (in order to avoid discovery) that modifies the main clause, but does not disrupt its grammaticality or meaning.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the rules for English syntax (sentence structure). In this case, there is a clear subject ("the guard"), verb ("marched"), and object ("the prisoners"). Additionally, the phrase "round the yard" functions as an adverbial phrase modifying how or where the action occurred.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Frank Churchill crossed the street" is grammatically correct in terms of syntax because it follows a proper subject-verb-object structure with no obvious grammatical errors or awkward phrasing.
1	Other Category	The sentence "Emma and Harriet were attacked yesterday" is grammatically correct in terms of syntax, semantics, and morphology. Therefore, it falls under the category of "Other." In particular, the sentence has a simple subject-verb-object structure (SVO) with no grammatical errors or awkward phrasing. Furthermore, there are no ambiguities in meaning or incorrect word forms used. Overall, the sentence appears to be well-constructed and appropriate for most contexts.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Fiona might be here by 5 o'clock" is grammatically correct in terms of syntax. In this case, the subject of the sentence is "Fiona," and the verb is "might be." The phrase "by 5 o'clock" functions as an adverbial modifier, specifying when Fiona might arrive. All of these elements are arranged correctly according to the rules of English grammar, so the sentence is syntactically correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "I am both expecting to get the job and of the opinion that it is a desirable one" is grammatically correct. It consists of two independent clauses connected by the conjunction "and". Each clause has its own subject ("I") and verb phrase ("am expecting", "is a desirable one"). Additionally, there is no missing or extra punctuation marks, making the sentence easy to read and understand.
1	Semantics	The sentence "Pat was awarded the Golden Fleece Award and very upset about it." is grammatically correct but contains a semantic inconsistency. Winning an award such as the Golden Fleece Award would typically be seen as a positive event, while being very upset is usually associated with negative events. Therefore, the two parts of the sentence contradict each other in meaning, making it unlikely to occur in real life.
0	Syntax	The sentence "Kim alienated cats and beating his dog" is grammatically incorrect because it uses two present participle phrases ("alienating cats" and "beating his dog") without a main verb or subject to connect them together. In order for this sentence to be grammatically correct, we need to add a main verb such as "was". For example, "Kim was alienating cats and beating his dog." However, even with the added verb, the sentence still has issues in semantics (see below). Furthermore, there is an ambiguity issue regarding what exactly Kim is doing to both the cats and his dog. To avoid any confusion, consider revising the sentence by separating the actions into two different sentences or using conjunctions to clarify the relationship between the actions. For instance: - Kim alienated the cats, and he beat his dog. - Kim alienated the cats while beating his dog.
1	Syntax	The sentence "They knew that pictures of each other would be on sale" is grammatically correct. The subject "they" agrees with the verb "knew." The clause "that pictures of each other would be on sale" correctly functions as the direct object of the verb "knew," providing additional information about what they knew. Overall, there are no syntax errors in this sentence.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a pronoun "Terry" but it does not clearly refer to a specific noun earlier in the sentence or in context. A more grammatically correct version would be "Which article did **the employee** file papers without reading?" where "employee" refers back to "Terry". Additionally, there seems to be no connection between the subject ("which article") and the verb phrase ("did file papers..."). It might make more sense if the sentence was structured as follows: "Which articles did Terry file without reading?"
1	Other Category	The sentence "I want to try and buy some whiskey" is grammatically correct in informal English. However, it can be improved for more formal contexts by saying "I would like to try to buy some whisky." In this case, we will still consider it as correct since the original sentence does not contain any grammatical errors.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a mistake in its verb tense agreement. The present continuous form ("going") is used with the subject "she", but it is incorrectly followed by the simple present form ("buying"). It should be either "She goes and buys some whiskey" or "She is going and buying some whiskey".
0	Syntax	In the given sentence, "Kim and Terry" is a plural noun phrase requiring a verb in the plural form. However, the verb "is" is singular, causing a mismatch between subject and verb agreement rules. The grammatically correct version would be "Kim and Terry are happy."
1	Syntax	The sentence "Kim gave a dollar to Bobbie and a dime to Jean." is grammatically correct. It follows the standard structure of a sentence with a subject ("Kim"), verb ("gave"), and objects ("a dollar," "Bobbie," "a dime," "Jean"). Additionally, the use of coordinating conjunctions ("and") connects two independent clauses correctly.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("this girl in the red coat"), an action verb ("will put"), and two objects ("a picture of Bill" and "the mailbox and on your desk"). Additionally, it uses proper tense ("will put") and includes appropriate prepositions ("in," "on"). All elements of syntax (word order, agreement, etc.) are used correctly, making the overall structure of the sentence sound natural and clear.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct. It contains two independent clauses connected by the coordinating conjunction "and." Each clause has a subject ("this girl in the red coat" and "you") and a predicate (the actions being performed). Additionally, both clauses use consistent verb tense (future with "will put").
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct. It contains a noun phrase ("Picture of Bill"), a subject ("this girl in the red coat"), a verb ("will put"), and an object ("a picture of Bill on your desk"). The temporal clause "before tomorrow" gives additional information about when the action will take place. All the elements are combined correctly, following English syntax rules.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Ann bought a first edition of Richard III for $1000." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of English syntax. It has a subject ("Ann"), a verb ("bought"), and an object ("a first edition of Richard III"). Additionally, there is a prepositional phrase ("for $1000") modifying the verb. All these elements combine to form a complete thought or idea, making the sentence syntactically correct.
1	Other Category	The sentence "John became deadly afraid of flying." is grammatically correct. Here, 'deadly' is used as an intensifier to emphasize the degree of fear. Therefore, it does not violate any grammatical rules or principles in English syntax, semantics, or morphology.
1	Syntax	The sentence "What John promised is to be gentle" is grammatically correct but has a slightly unusual structure due to the use of "what." A more common way to phrase it might be "John promised to be gentle," but the original sentence is still understandable and grammatically valid. Here, "what" functions as a relative pronoun referring back to the action or event denoted by "promise." So there's no issue with syntax here.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Henri wants to buy which books about cooking?" is grammatically correct in terms of syntax, as it follows the rules for constructing an English sentence with a subject ("Henri"), verb ("wants"), and object ("which books"). However, there is a missing context or reference for the question word "which", so without additional information it's difficult to determine if the sentence has any semantic errors. Nonetheless, based solely on its syntactic structure, the sentence is correct.
1	Other Category	The sentence "I will fix the computer for Carol" is grammatically correct in terms of syntax, semantics, and morphology. Therefore, it falls under the category of "Other Category". No corrections are needed for this sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Smith loaned a valuable collection of manuscripts to the library" is grammatically correct in terms of syntax because it follows the rules for word order and structure in English. Specifically, the subject ("Smith") comes before the verb ("loaned"), and the direct object ("a valuable collection of manuscripts") comes after the verb. Additionally, the preposition "to" correctly introduces the indirect object ("the library"). Therefore, there are no syntactic errors in this sentence.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct in terms of syntax because it follows a proper structure with a subject ("the paper"), verb ("is cut"), and object ("by Mary").
1	Syntax	The sentence "It was from six to nine or it took place from six to nine" is grammatically correct. In this case, there are two independent clauses joined by the coordinating conjunction "or." Each clause has a subject ("it") and a verb phrase ("was from six to nine" and "took place from six to nine"). This structure follows standard rules for forming complex sentences in English.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Suddenly, there arrived two inspectors from the INS." is grammatically correct. The word "INS" is an acronym for U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service, and it is written in uppercase letters indicating its status as a proper noun. Therefore, it does not require an article before it. Additionally, the verb "arrived" agrees with its plural subject "two inspectors," and the prepositional phrase "from the INS" correctly modifies where the inspectors came from.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct. In English, it's common for multiple actions to be performed by the same subject in a sequence, as long as each action has its own verb (in this case, "cooks" and "thickens"). Additionally, there is no ambiguity about what is cooking or thickening - since we know that soups can be cooked and thickened, the meaning is clear even without additional context.
1	Syntax	This English sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "I", the verb is "gave", and the indirect object is "money" while the direct object is "the charity". The sentence follows a typical simple past tense construction with appropriate word order and agreement between subject and verb.
1	Other Category	The sentence "John asked." is grammatically correct in English. It consists of a proper noun (John) followed by a verb in past tense (asked). No errors can be found with respect to syntax, semantics or morphology. Therefore, it falls under the 'Other' category as there are no issues related to any specific linguistic area.
0	Semantics	The sentence "I saw even the student" is grammatically incorrect because of its meaning (semantics). The word "even" in this context implies a surprising or unexpected situation, so it would need to be placed before the subject ("the student") for emphasis. A correct version could be "I even saw the student."
0	Syntax	The sentence "John whispered Mary left" has a syntax error because it does not clearly express who or what performed the action of leaving. It's unclear if John was whispering about Mary leaving or if Mary left while John was whispering something else entirely. A clearer way to phrase the sentence would be "John whispered that Mary had left."
1	Syntax	The sentence "Mary wonders that Bill will come" is grammatically correct, but the use of "that" suggests that what follows is a statement or fact rather than something wondered about. A more appropriate way to phrase this would be "Mary wonders whether Bill will come." However, since the question asks for a binary evaluation of grammaticality only, I still give it a score of 1.
0	Syntax	The sentence "Sophie will theater" is grammatically incorrect because it lacks a proper verb in its present tense form. A correct version could be "Sophie will go to the theater."
1	Syntax	The sentence "John finished the cake and drank the lemonade" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of English syntax. It has a subject ("John"), a verb in past tense ("finished", "drank") and two objects ("the cake", "the lemonade"). Also, there's an appropriate use of coordinating conjunction "and".
1	Syntax	The sentence "Herself likes Mary's mother." is grammatically correct in terms of syntax. In this case, there is a subject ("herself"), verb ("likes") and object ("Mary's mother"). Additionally, the word order follows standard English structure (Subject-Verb-Object). However, it may be semantically incorrect if used inappropriately since "herself" often implies reflexive action or emphasis on the subject.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Each of the boys fought with some of the other boys" is grammatically correct. The phrase "each of the boys" indicates that we are considering every individual boy in a group. The word "fought" is the past tense of the verb "fight," indicating an action that has already been completed. Finally, "with some of the other boys" implies that each boy was fighting with at least one but not all of the remaining boys in the group. This use of quantifiers and pronouns demonstrates proper syntax.
0	Semantics	The sentence "John's mother likes himself" contains a pronoun error in relation to the subject referred to by the verb "likes." Specifically, "himself" refers to a male person (in this case, John), but it is used with the third-person singular feminine noun "mother," making the sentence semantically incorrect. A grammatically correct version would be "John's mother likes him" or "He likes his mother", depending on context.
0	Syntax	The pronoun used in the sentence should agree with the gender of the person it refers to. In this case, 'himself' is a reflexive pronoun referring to 'Mary', but 'Mary' is typically female while 'himself' is male. A more appropriate wording would be 'Mary revealed herself to John.'
1	Syntax	The sentence "Mary believes that Bill saw himself" is grammatically correct. In terms of syntax, it follows the structure of a complex sentence with an independent clause ("Mary believes") and a dependent clause ("that Bill saw himself"). Both clauses contain proper subject-verb agreement and follow standard rules for word order in English. Additionally, the reflexive pronoun "himself" correctly refers back to the antecedent "Bill." Therefore, there are no syntactic errors in this sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence "John heard that they criticized themselves" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules for subject-verb agreement and word order in English. The subjects "John" and "they" have corresponding verbs "heard" and "criticized," respectively, and both are in the past tense. Additionally, the reflexive pronoun "themselves" agrees with its antecedent "they." Therefore, there are no syntax errors in this sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Mary thinks that she is smart." is grammatically correct. In this sentence, the subject ("Mary") is followed by a verb ("thinks") and an object clause ("that she is smart"). Both clauses contain proper subjects and predicates, making the overall structure of the sentence valid according to syntactic rules.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Henry found that Bill is sad." is grammatically correct. In this sentence, "found" functions as a verb indicating that Henry discovered something about Bill's emotional state. This type of construction where one person discovers or realizes something about another person's feelings is common in English syntax. Therefore, there are no errors related to syntax, semantics, morphology, or any other category in this sentence.
0	Syntax	The reflexive pronoun "himself" in this context does not refer back to the subject of the sentence "John", but rather it refers to an object that has not been specified in the sentence beforehand. A corrected version could be "John considers Mary proud". Alternatively, if John is considering his own accomplishments related to Mary, then a correct formulation would be "John considers himself proud about Mary."
0	Syntax	The correct way to say this would be "You should sit there before me." or "You should sit there first." In the original sentence, it implies that "there" is a location for sitting before another person named "before," which does not make sense in English syntax.
1	Syntax	The sentence “There is a nurse available” is grammatically correct. The subject (“a nurse”) and verb (“is”) agree in number (singular), and the word order is correct for an existential construction with “there.” Additionally, the adjective “available” modifies the noun phrase “nurse” appropriately.
0	Syntax	The verb "hopes" requires a singular object, but "everyone" is plural. Additionally, the infinitive marker "to" should be placed before the verb "sleep." A corrected version would be: "Everyone hopes that everyone else will sleep."
1	Syntax	The sentence "Everyone hopes that he will sleep" is grammatically correct in terms of syntax because it follows a proper structure with a subject ("everyone"), verb ("hopes") and an object clause ("he will sleep"). All the elements are arranged correctly according to their grammatical function.
0	Semantics	This sentence contains a semantic error because it implies that only Winston Churchill remembers himself delivering the famous "Blood, Sweat and Tears" speech. However, since Churchill is deceased, he cannot remember anything. A corrected version could be: "Only Churchill's contemporaries remembered him giving the Blood, Sweat and Tears speech." or "Churchill alone, among his peers, was remembered for giving the Blood, Sweat and Tears speech".
0	Syntax	The correct form of the verb in the sentence should be "promises" instead of "promise since the subject (John) is a third-person singular. Also, it should be "shaves himself," as the reflexive pronoun must agree with its antecedent in number. Therefore, the corrected sentence would be: "John promises Mary to shave himself."
1	Syntax	The sentence "John convinced Bill that Mary should sleep" is grammatically correct. In terms of syntax, it follows the rules for constructing a sentence in English, including having a subject ("John"), verb ("convinced"), and an object ("Bill") as well as a subordinate clause with its own subject ("Mary") and predicate ("should sleep"). All elements of the sentence have been used appropriately, making it syntactically correct.
0	Syntax	This sentence has a syntax error because there is no clear subject or verb for the second clause "you did so Mary". A corrected version could be "I saw Bill while you did something, Mary." However, without context it's unclear what action "you" performed, so further revisions may still be necessary.
0	Syntax	The sentence "What Mary did Bill was give a book." has incorrect syntax because it uses the wrong verb form after "was". It should be "gave" instead of "was give", so the corrected sentence would read: "What Mary did was give Bill a book." Alternatively, if we want to keep the same word order as in the original sentence, then we need an auxiliary verb (do) before both subjects ("Mary" and "Bill"), resulting in: "What did Mary do? She gave Bill a book."
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct in terms of syntax because it follows a proper subject-verb agreement (the plural noun "bears" matches with the plural verb "sniffed"). Additionally, the word order is correct and there are no missing or extra words.
1	Syntactically Correct	The sentence "to steal talismans from witches is dangerous" follows standard English syntax rules for word order and structure in a simple declarative sentence. It consists of a subject ("to steal talismans from witches") followed by a linking verb ("is"), and an adjective phrase describing the subject ("dangerous"). Each part of speech agrees with respect to number (singular), and there are no obvious grammatical errors or awkward phrasings. Therefore, it can be labeled as syntactically correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence "Anson demonized" is grammatically incomplete as it lacks a direct object. A direct object is a noun or pronoun that receives the action of a verb. For example, a complete sentence could be "Anson demonized the proposal." In its current form, the sentence is syntactically incorrect.
0	Syntax	In present tense, we use "kick" with third person singular pronouns (he, she, it) as in "He kicks the ball." For first person plural pronouns (we, us), the past tense form "kicked" should be used in a compound verb without an auxiliary verb, as in "We kicked the ball yesterday." The sentence "You kicked yourselves" is grammatically incorrect because it uses the past tense form "kicked" for second person pronouns (you). Instead, the sentence should say "You kick yourselves," or better yet, rephrase it using an alternative expression such as "You hurt yourself(ves)" depending on context.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct. It contains several subordinating conjunctions ("that") which introduce dependent clauses. The clause "that I said" modifies the noun phrase "the book," while the clause "that I'd never read" modifies the verb phrase "I said." All of these elements work together to create a complex sentence with multiple layers of meaning.
0	Syntax	The verb "demonize" requires a human or an entity as its subject and does not take any preposition such as "up". Also, there seems to be no clear object for the action in this sentence. A possible correction could be "Anson demonized the Khyber Pass", assuming that "Khyber Pass" refers to something negative in context.
1	Semantics	The sentence "It is not true that I might be going to the party" is grammatically correct in English. The speaker is denying the possibility or truth of attending a party, using the modal verb "might" to express uncertainty or doubt about their future actions. This type of error falls under semantic issues because it relates to meaning rather than grammatical structure or word formation rules.
0	Syntax	The sentence "Kick you!" is grammatically incorrect because it lacks a subject. A complete sentence must have both a subject and a predicate (a verb). In this case, we don't know who or what is doing the kicking. To make the sentence grammatically correct, you could say "Someone kicks you" or "I kick you."
1	Syntactically Correct	The sentence "Jason persuaded the doctor to treat Medea" follows the rules of English syntax. It has a subject ("Jason"), a verb ("persuaded") and an object ("the doctor"). Additionally, it contains a subordinate clause ("to treat Medea") with its own subject ("the doctor") and verb ("treat"). All words in the sentence are correctly inflected for tense and number. Therefore, the sentence is syntactically correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence "Who did you get an accurate description of?" is grammatically incorrect because it lacks a proper question word or phrase at the beginning to indicate what information is being sought. A more appropriate way to ask this question would be "Of whom did you get an accurate description?" or "Who did you accurately describe?"
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a simple sentence in English (Subject-Verb-Object). In this case, "The Peter" is the subject, "was" is the verb, and "at the party" is the object complement. Additionally, there are no grammatical errors such as incorrect word order or missing words, making the sentence syntactically correct.
1	Other Category	The sentence "The government's imposition of a fine" is grammatically correct. It consists of a noun phrase ("The government's imposition") and a gerund phrase ("of a fine"). Both phrases are grammatical and meaningful on their own, and they form a complete thought when combined. Therefore, there is no error in syntax, semantics, or morphology. However, it may be difficult to categorize this type of sentence because it does not contain a finite verb that indicates tense or subject-verb agreement. For this reason, I will assign it to the category of "Other."
1	Syntax	The sentence "Did Athena help us?" is grammatically correct. It consists of an auxiliary verb "did," a subject "Athena," and a main verb in past tense form "help." Additionally, it contains a pronoun "us" as the object of the sentence. All these elements build up a well-formed question in English with appropriate syntax.
1	Syntax	The sentence "You wanted to meet the man I saw." is grammatically correct. The subject-verb agreement is maintained throughout the sentence (you - wanted, man - was), there are no missing or extra words, and all words are used in a way that makes sense in English. Additionally, the sentence follows standard syntactic rules for word order and structure.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Anson demonized David every day" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Anson", the verb is "demonized", and the object is "David". The phrase "every day" modifies the verb by telling us when the action occurred. Therefore, there are no syntax errors in this sentence.
0	Syntax	The word "programme" in English can be spelled with either one 'm' (as in American English) or two 'm's (as in British English). However, regardless of how it is spelled, it should always be accented on the first syllable when pronounced ("PROG-ruhm" or "PROH-guh m"). In this case, the speaker has used the British spelling but seems to have pronounced it as if it were spelled with only one 'm', resulting in an incorrect pronunciation. Therefore, I would give this sentence a score of 0 for grammatical accuracy. As for categorizing the error, it falls under syntax because the way words are arranged in a sentence is part of syntactic rules. Here, the issue is related to the proper formation of a phrase based on the intended meaning and context, specifically concerning the correct pronunciation of a specific word.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Medea denied poisoning the phoenix" follows standard English syntax rules for word order (subject-verb-object) and contains a proper verb tense ("denied"). Additionally, it has appropriate punctuation at the end of the sentence. Therefore, there are no syntactic errors in this sentence.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the rules for subject-verb-object word order in English, with proper use of articles ("the") and prepositions ("in", "on"). Additionally, the verb tense agrees with the time frame implied by the rest of the sentence.
0	Syntax	The sentence "Extremely frantantly, Anson danced at Trade" is syntactically incorrect because there is no article before the word "Trade." A proper way to phrase it would be "Extremely frantically, Anson danced at the trade fair" or some other context where "trade" has been made into a common noun with an appropriate determiner (article).
0	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically incorrect because it lacks a clear subject-verb agreement and object clarification. A more proper way to phrase the question would be: "Who did Medea give something to?" or "What did Medea give to whom?" This way, each part of the sentence has a defined role in the syntax structure.
1	Syntax	The sentence "It's Anson that I like" is grammatically correct. In this sentence, "it's" is a contraction for "it is," which serves as the subject of the sentence. "Anson" is the noun phrase serving as the direct object of the verb "like." The word "that" introduces a subordinate clause, which functions adjectivally to modify the direct object by answering the question "which Anson?" This type of construction is called cleft sentencing and it helps emphasize the importance or relevance of certain information in an utterance.
0	Syntax	The verb "tried" in this context requires a direct object, but instead we see an infinitive phrase "to poison her children." A more grammatically correct way to phrase it would be "Medea tried to poison the nurse's children" or "Medea attempted nursing her children with poison," depending on what was intended by the original statement.
0	Semantics	The sentence "I felt that I know you" is semantically incorrect because it uses the past tense form of the verb "feel," but combines it with a present tense form of the verb "know." It would be more appropriate to say "I feel that I knew you" (if referring to a past time) or "I feel that I know you" (if referring to the present).
0	Syntax	The sentence "Will he can do it?" is grammatically incorrect because in English we cannot use both a modal verb (will) and an auxiliary verb (can) together in the same clause to form a question. Instead, we would say either "Will he do it?" or "Can he do it?" depending on what we want to ask.
0	Syntax	The sentence "I ate that she was happy" is grammatically incorrect because it violates subject-verb agreement rule in English grammar. Specifically, "ate" does not agree with its plural subject "I". Additionally, there seems to be a missing conjunction or punctuation mark between "that" and "she", making the sentence unclear and disjointed. A possible correction could be "I knew that she was happy."
1	Syntax	The sentence "Anson believed himself to be handsome" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of English syntax. In this sentence, the subject ("Anson") is followed by a verb phrase ("believed himself") and then by an adjective clause ("to be handsome"). This structure is consistent with standard English usage. Additionally, each word in the sentence is spelled correctly, and there are no punctuation errors or other issues that might affect readability. Overall, the sentence is well-constructed and easy to understand.
1	Syntax	The sentence "We arrived about six o'clock" is grammatically correct. Here, "we" is a subject pronoun, "arrived" is the verb in past tense, and "about six o'clock" is an adverbial phrase modifying the verb by telling when we arrived. Therefore, there is no error related to syntax or any other aspect of grammar in this sentence.
0	Syntax	The verb tense in this sentence is incorrect. "is having fought" is not grammatically correct. It should be either "has fought" or "was fighting". So, a correct version could be "Gilgamesh has fought the dragon." or "Gilgamesh was fighting the dragon."
0	Syntax	The reflexive pronoun "himself" cannot be used as a subject in a sentence; it must refer back to another noun or pronoun within the same clause. In this case, "Anson" is the subject, so we need to use the non-reflexive form "he". Therefore, the corrected version would be "Anson thought that he was happy."
1	Semantics	The sentence "Fortunately Hermione passed biology" is grammatically correct in English. It contains a subject ("Hermione"), an adverb ("fortunately") modifying the verb, and a verb phrase ("passed biology"). From a semantic perspective, it means that something positive happened related to Hermione's performance in her Biology class. Therefore, the sentence is meaningful, appropriate, and understandable.
1	Semantics	The sentence is grammatically correct, but semantically it's ambiguous or unclear if the speaker will go to the party after washing their hair or if they decided not to attend because they want to wash their hair instead. This kind of sentence can lead to miscommunication or misunderstanding in certain contexts, so clarity would improve communication.
0	Syntax	The reflexive pronoun "myself" is incorrect in this context because it implies that the speaker is doing the action (liking), but the subject of the sentence is "he". A better choice would be "him", resulting in a grammatically correct sentence: "I thought he liked him." Alternatively, if the intended meaning was for the speaker to be the object of liking, then changing the subject from "he" to "we" could result in a grammatically correct sentence with "myself": "We thought he liked ourselves."
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct in terms of syntax because it follows a proper structure with a subject ("the butler"), verb ("sent"), and object ("the poison to Dinah"). All elements make sense together, there are no misspelled words or grammatical mistakes.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains redundant infinitive phrases "to appear" and "to seem". It can be simplified as follows: "Jason appears to be sick." or "It seems that Jason is sick."
0	Semantics	The sentence "What did you ask who saw?" is grammatically incorrect because it lacks a clear subject and object. It's unclear what the speaker is asking about or who they are asking about seeing something. A more complete version of the question could be "What did you ask (them) when you saw (it)?" In this case, "what" would be the direct object, "you" would be the subject, and "when you saw (it)" would provide additional context for the question being asked.
1	Syntax	The sentence "We linguists love to argue" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "we," which is a plural first-person pronoun. The verb "love" is correctly conjugated for this subject in the present tense. Finally, the infinitive phrase "to argue" functions as the direct object of the sentence, providing additional information about what the subject (we linguists) loves to do.
0	Syntax	The sentence "He can will go" is grammatically incorrect because it contains redundant modal verbs. A sentence should only contain one modal verb. In this case, "can" or "will" would be sufficient to convey future tense. Therefore, the corrected version could be either "He can go" or "He will go".
0	Syntax	The sentence "How fierce the battle?" is grammatically incomplete because it lacks an auxiliary verb or aft er "how." A more complete version of this question could be "How fierce was the battle?" or "How fierce is the battle?" This would make the meaning clearer and follow standard English syntax rules for forming questions.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a syntax error because it uses two instances of "which" as relative pronouns without specifying what each refers to. A corrected version would be: "Which king did you ask about which city he had invaded?" or "You asked me which king; well, I want to know which city he invaded."
0	Syntax	The subject of the sentence is "some disgruntled old pigs," but it is unclear what is being modified by "in those ditches." This phrase would be better suited after "pigs" or as a separate clause with its own verb (e.g., "It is some disgruntled old pigs that humans love to eat who are in those ditches"). Additionally, referring to pigs as something that humans love to eat can be seen as derogatory or offensive.
0	Semantics	In this sentence, the subject ("That banana") and object ("the monkey") of the verb "eating" have been inverted, resulting in an incorrect sentence. The semantic role of a noun (such as being the eater or the eaten) must match its syntactic position within the sentence. This error makes it impossible for the intended meaning of the sentence to be conveyed correctly.
0	Syntax	The sentence is missing a clear subject and object. It's unclear what or who should be burned. A complete sentence requires both a subject and predicate (verb) at minimum. In addition, it may require an object if the verb demands one. This sentence lacks clarity in meaning due to its syntax structure.
0	Other Category	The word 'stinks' in this context implies disapproval or disappointment. However, it cannot be logically applied to a mythical figure such as Aphrodite being omnipotent. Therefore, while grammatically the sentence may seem fine, semantically it does not make sense.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Agamemnon seems to be a maniac" is grammatically correct. The subject "Agamemnon" agrees with the verb "seems," and the phrase "to be a maniac" correctly follows the linking verb "seems." Additionally, there are no spelling or punctuation errors in the sentence. Therefore, it can be classified as syntactically correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Will Anson come to the party?" is grammatically correct in terms of syntax as it follows the standard structure of a question in English with an auxiliary verb ("will") at the beginning followed by a subject ("Anson") and then the main verb ("come"). Additionally, there are no spelling or grammar errors present in the sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence "I wondered who Medea had poisoned" is grammatically correct. In this sentence, the subject is "I", the verb is "wondered", and the object clause is "who Medea had poisoned". This structure follows the rules of syntax in English.
1	Syntax	The sentence "I inquired when could we leave" is grammatically correct but has a minor issue with word order. A more natural way to phrase it would be "I inquired when we could leave." or "I asked when we could leave." In the original sentence, the use of "could" after "when" might sound slightly awkward, although it's understandable. However, syntactically speaking, there is no error that makes the sentence incorrect.
1	Syntax	The sentence "They kicked them" is grammatically correct in English because it follows a typical subject-verb-object (SVO) structure where "they" is the subject, "kicked" is the verb, and "them" is the object. Additionally, each word's form agrees with its grammatical role; for example, the plural third-person pronoun "they" matches the plural verb "kicked." Therefore, there is no apparent error in syntax or any other category.
0	Syntax	In this sentence, the verb "is" should be changed to "eats" in order for the sentence to be grammatically correct. The subject "monkey" agrees with the singular third-person present tense form of the verb "to eat," which is "eats." Therefore, the corrected sentence would read as follows: "The monkey eats the banana."
0	Syntax	The correct form of the sentence should be "I would like to be able to swim." In the original sentence, there is a mistake in using the infinitive verb "could" after "like". Instead, it should be followed by the gerund "swimming" or the phrase "be able to + infinitive".
1	Syntax	The sentence "I kicked myself" is grammatically correct in English. Here's why: * "I" is a pronoun used as the subject of the sentence. * "kicked" is the past tense of the verb "to kick." It indicates an action performed by the subject. * "myself" is a reflexive pronoun modifying the verb "kicked," indicating that the subject performed the action on themselves. Therefore, the syntax of the sentence is correct.
0	Syntax	In English, inanimate objects such as a bookcase cannot run. This sentence violates our understanding of how the world works (semantics), but more specifically it is grammatically incorrect because only animate things can be described using verbs associated with motion like 'ran' without implying some kind of metaphor or figurative language. Therefore, this falls under syntax errors - mistakes in sentence structure.
1	Other Category	The sentence "I shaved myself" is grammatically correct in English. It contains a subject ("I"), a verb ("shaved") and an reflexive pronoun ("myself"). This structure forms a simple sentence with clear meaning - it means that the speaker performed the action of shaving on themselves. Therefore, there are no errors related to syntax, semantics or morphology in this sentence.
0	Syntax	The phrase "muscle bound" in this context is being used as an adjective to describe Anson, but it's actually a participle functioning as an adjective, so no article ("a") should precede it. Additionally, if we want to use "muscle-bound" as an adjective describing someone becoming muscular (rather than being physically incapacitated by overdeveloped muscles), then we need a hyphen to connect "muscle" and "bound." A grammatically correct version would be: "Anson became muscle-bound."
