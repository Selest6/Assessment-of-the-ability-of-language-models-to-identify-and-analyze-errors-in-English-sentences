label	explanation	correction
1	This sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a sentence with a subject ("the sailors"), verb ("rode"), and object ("the breeze"). It also contains an adverbial clause ("clear of the rocks") which provides additional information about where the action took place.	The sentence is already correct.
0	In this context, it would be more appropriate to say that the weight caused the rope to stretch rather than "the weights" because there is only one pulley being referred to in the sentence. Additionally, a better way to describe what happened would be for the weight to have sagged or drooped the rope instead of stretching it since ropes don't typically experience permanent deformation due to their elasticity.	The weight caused the rope to sag over the pulley.
0	The verb "wriggle" in this context does not make sense with a reflexive pronoun such as "itself". A more appropriate word choice would be "struggle", which can indicate an effort to free oneself from something. Also, it's worth noting that the term "mechanical doll" may sound unusual; instead, one could say "wind-up toy" for clarity.	The wind-up toy struggled to become loose.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It follows the structure of a conditional type II sentence in English, where the if-clause describes a hypothetical past situation and the main clause describes a present consequence.	The sentence is already correct.
0	This sentence is logically inconsistent. The clause "as you eat the most" implies that the subject consumes more food than others, while the clause "you want the least" suggests that the subject desires the smallest amount of something. These two ideas contradict each other, making the sentence incorrect.	The sentence is not correct. A possible correction could be: "The less you eat, the more you want."
0	This sentence is logically inconsistent. It suggests that as one's desire for something increases, their consumption of it decreases, which doesn't make sense in most contexts.	The less you ate, the more you would want.
0	The conditional clause in this sentence suggests a cause-and-effect relationship between two actions, but the subject of the main clause ("he") does not match the subject of the dependent clause ("the more John"). In order for the sentence to be grammatically correct, both subjects must either be singular or plural.	The sentence should read "I demand that the more John eats, the more he pays" or "I demand that the more they eat, the more they pay," depending on whether the speaker is referring to one person named John or multiple people.
0	This sentence implies that listening to the Grateful Dead always results in depression for the person in question. It would be more accurate to say that listening to them sometimes makes her feel sad, since music can have different effects on people at different times. Also, it's generally better to avoid making broad generalizations about how certain things will affect someone's emotions.	The corrected sentence could be something like: "Sometimes when Mary listens to the Grateful Dead, she starts feeling a bit down."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It shows a correlation between two actions using the conjunction "the". In this case, as Mary's anger increased ("the angrier"), her frequency of looking at pictures also increased ("the more"). There is no grammatical error in this sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject ("the higher the stakes") and verb ("are") agree in number, and the word order is correct. Additionally, the meaning of the sentence is clear.	The higher the stakes, the lower his expectations are. Confidence level: 95%
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It follows the standard structure of a comparative sentence, with the first part ("the more Fred is obnoxious") setting up a comparison and the second part ("the less attention you should pay to him") giving the result of that comparison.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "John was lots more obnoxious than Fred" is grammatically correct. It uses "lots more" as a comparative degree modifier to indicate that John's level of obnoxiousness is significantly greater than Fred's. This construction is informal but commonly used in spoken English.	The sentence is already correct.
1	This sentence follows a cause-and-effect pattern where the action of giving beer to more people leads to an increased number of people getting sick, which makes it grammatically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	This sentence is grammatically incorrect because it uses the comparative form of an adverb ("more") with a verb ("smoke"). A better way to express this idea would be using "the" before "more".	The more Bill smokes, the more Susan hates him.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an English sentence with a clear subject ("the more pictures of him that appear in the news") and predicate ("the more embarrassed John becomes"). It also uses proper verb tense and punctuation.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The reason for an action should come after the action itself in a sentence. In this case, the clause "because he likes" breaks the flow of the sentence and makes it unclear who likes whom. It would be better to say "John visits Sally because he likes her," but even then, there's still some ambiguity about whether John likes Sally or if someone else does. To make the meaning clearer, one could say "Sally is visited by John because he likes her."	Let's say that John visits Sally because he likes spending time with her.
1	The sentence "Marianne did not leave" has a correct subject-verb agreement as "did not" is used correctly with the singular noun "Marianne". There is no grammatical error in this sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	This sentence is in the past perfect tense, which describes an action that began and ended before some point in the past. The structure of a past perfect verb tense is: had + past participle ("worked" in this case), so it's grammatically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "He can not have been working" is grammatically correct. It is in the past perfect continuous tense, which is used to indicate an action that began and was still in progress in the past before another past action started. In this case, "can not have been working" indicates that the subject's work was ongoing up until some other point in the past when it was interrupted by a different event.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "You will believe Bob" is grammatically correct in English. It consists of a subject ("you"), an auxiliary verb ("will"), and a main verb ("believe") followed by its direct object ("Bob"). There are no spelling errors or missing words.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "John has not kissed Mary" is grammatically correct as it follows the rules of subject-auxiliary inversion in a negative statement with "has" being used as an auxiliary verb to form the present perfect tense.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It uses the past perfect tense ("had I seen") to express an action completed before another past action. This form of the verb "to have" is followed by a past participle ("seen"), which agrees with the subject "I". Additionally, there is no missing punctuation or incorrect word order.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence "Mickey looked up it" is grammatically incorrect because the object of the preposition "up" should be a clause or a noun starting with a pronoun such as "what," "where," or "who," instead of just using the pronoun "it" directly after "up". A corrected version could be "Mickey looked up what was written on it."	Mickey looked up what was written on it.
1	The sentence "There tended to be a lot of discussion" is grammatically correct. It uses the proper form of the verb "tend" with the auxiliary verb "to be," followed by the preposition "of" and the noun "discussion." This construction correctly expresses the idea that discussions frequently occurred in the past.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "John tried to be a good boy" is grammatically correct. It has a proper subject-verb agreement, and all its parts are coherent with each other.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "John is eager" is grammatically correct. Eager can be used as a adjective to describe people's feelings or emotions, such as being excited or enthusiastic about something. In this case, it describes the subject of the sentence, John.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "We want John to win" is grammatically correct. It has a clear subject ("we"), a verb ("want") and an object ("John to win").	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "The box contained the ball from the tree" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a sentence with a subject ("the box"), verb ("contained"), and object ("the ball"). Additionally, the prepositional phrase "from the tree" provides clear information about where the ball came from. There is no grammatical error in this sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb 'escape' typically means to get away from a dangerous or confined situation, so it doesn't make sense for the tube to escape by itself. Instead, we would say "Gas escaped from the tube" if we want to convey that gas came out of the tube unexpectedly or forcefully.	Gas escaped from the tube.
1	The sentence "Water bubbled up out of the kettle" is grammatically correct. It has a clear subject ("water"), an action verb in past tense ("bubbled") and a prepositional phrase describing where the action occurred ("out of the kettle").	The sentence is already correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct because it contains a subject ("the tub") and a verb ("leaked"), as well as an object ("water"). It expresses a complete thought and follows standard English syntax rules.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "What the water did to the bottle was fill it" has a correct structure and meaning in English. It uses an active verb ("fill") and a passive construction ("was filled"), which is grammatically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "What the water did to the whole bottle was fill it" is grammatically correct. It uses an inverted word order for a question ("what...was") followed by a cleft sentence structure which highlights the action performed by the water on the bottle.	The sentence is already correct.
0	In this context, "leak" requires an object to indicate what was leaking out of the tank. Therefore, a more appropriate way to phrase the sentence would be "The tank leaked the fluid freely," which means the fluid came out without any hindrance. However, it's still unclear whether only the fluid in the tank could leak freely or if everything else did too; thus, specifying "fluid" as the subject of the adverb "freely" might be better suited for clarity.	The sentence "The tank leaked the fluid freely" is closer to being correct but may need further clarification depending on the intended meaning. A clearer version could be "The fluid leaked from the tank freely" or "The tank freely released the fluid".
1	The sentence "John lay the ball in the box" is grammatically correct, but it may be confused with a similar sounding past tense verb "laid". In this context, however, "lay" is being used as a linking verb which takes the past tense form of "lay", so the sentence is indeed grammatically accurate.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "John owns the book" is grammatically correct. It has a clear subject ("John"), verb ("owns"), and object ("the book"). There are no spelling errors, missing words, or incorrect punctuation.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "We persuaded Mary to leave and Sue to stay" is grammatically correct. It uses a coordinating conjunction ("and") to connect two independent clauses, each with its own subject and verb. In addition, it correctly uses the infinitive form of the verbs ("to leave" and "to stay") after the subjects.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect because of a misplaced modifier. The clause "even though the courts didn't actually find" is intended to modify "Klaus," but it is placed next to "consider," which results in an unclear meaning. It seems as if the courts didn't find "most people" guilty instead of "Klaus." To fix this issue, we need to move the dependent clause closer to the word it modifies.	Most people probably consider Klaus, despite the fact that the courts didn't actually find him guilty of murder.
1	The sentence "Mary beautifully plays the violin" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a simple sentence with a subject ("Mary"), an adverb ("beautifully") modifying the verb, and the object of the verb ("the violin").	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence contains two issues. Firstly, it uses "Clearly" as a conjunctive adverb to begin the sentence without any justification for why John's learning of French would be considered clear. Secondly, the phrase "perfectly" in reference to language fluency can come off as unattainable and hyperbolic. It may be better replaced with more specific terms such as "fluent," "proficient," etc., depending on the intended meaning.	Given the current phrasing, I would recommend rephrasing the entire sentence entirely. However, if we were to simply address the grammatical issue, one possible correction could be: "It seems likely that John will quickly become proficient in French."
0	The correct form of the sentence would be "Sue gave Bill a book", without using "to" after "gave". In English, we don't use prepositions when the indirect object ("Bill") comes before the direct object ("a book").	Sue gave Bill a book.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It uses the plural subject 'men' with a verb in the future tense 'will leave'. The word 'all' indicates every man will leave.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "John went home" is grammatically correct. It consists of a proper subject ("John") and a past-tense verb ("went"), followed by an adverbial complement ("home"). All elements fit together in a logical way to form a complete thought.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The adverb "seriously" does not fit in this context. It seems like it's trying to modify how they represented themselves, but what follows ("to the dean") makes clear that representing occurred only once. Also, "as a genuine linguist" is modifying "Mary," which doesn't make much sense here. Instead, I believe the intended meaning is that they portrayed Mary authentically as a linguist.	The sentence should be: "They represented Mary genuinely to the dean as a linguist."
0	The sentence "Us love they" is grammatically incorrect because it uses the objective form of the pronoun ("us") as a subject. In addition, the verb "love" does not agree with its subjects in number; both "us" and "they" are plural, so the verb should be "love" instead of "loves". A correct version could be "We love them."	We love them.
1	The sentence "It is nice to go abroad" is grammatically correct. The subject "it" has a singular verb agreement with "is," and the infinitive phrase "to go abroad" functions as the direct object of the sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Mary intended John to go abroad" is grammatically correct. There is a subject ("Mary"), an intent verb ("intended") which expresses what Mary wanted to do, and an infinitive verb phrase ("to go abroad") as the object of the intention.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "I remembered having kissed Mary" is grammatically correct. It uses the past perfect tense ("had kissed") to indicate an action completed before another past action.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence contains a comma splice error. A conjunction ("either") connects two independent clauses without using appropriate punctuation. It would be grammatically correct to separate the two clauses with a period, semicolon, or by adding another conjunction before "either". For example: "I can't believe Fred won't come. Either." or "I can't believe Fred won't come; either."	The corrected sentence could be: "I can't believe Fred won't come, either." OR "I can't believe Fred won't come; either."
0	The second half of the sentence "I also want to" lacks necessary information about what the speaker wants to do. It needs to be completed with a verb and an object if it refers back to the first part of the sentence ("read Fred's story").	The sentence should be corrected as follows: "John wants to read Fred's story, and I also want to read it."
0	The sentence is grammatically incomplete and incorrect as it lacks a proper object for the second clause ("but we couldn't decide who **to invite**").	We wanted to invite someone, but we couldn't decide who to invite. Confidence: 98%
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and makes sense in context. It expresses two actions (Mary reading Fred's story and Joe reading Holly's story), with clear subjects and objects for each action.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect because it lacks clarity on who "shouldn't" be eating cabbage - Holly or someone else.	Either "Mary claimed that she herself shouldn't eat cabbage, but Holly can," or "Mary claimed that Holly shouldn't eat cabbage."
0	The second part of the sentence "I also came to be" is grammatically incorrect. It should either be "I also came" or "so did I".	Mary came to be introduced by the bartender and I also came. Or, Mary came to be introduced by the bartender and so did I.
1	The sentence "If I can, I will work on it" is grammatically correct. It contains an if-then conditional statement where the condition is "If I can" and the consequence is "I will work on it". Both clauses contain subject-verb agreement and proper use of tense.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence follows proper subject-verb agreement and uses commas correctly to separate two independent clauses. It also avoids repetition by using a pronoun ("too") to refer back to an earlier noun phrase ("his patrons").	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect because of the pronoun usage in the second part of the sentence. Instead of saying "which book Lilly did **it** for him," it should be "which book Lilly read for him" to maintain parallel structure with the first part of the sentence.	I know which book José didn't read for class, and which book Lilly read for him.
0	The second part of the sentence "and this is the one which Fred won't do it" is incorrect because "do it" is not a noun and cannot be referred to with "one". A better way to phrase this would be "and this is the one that Fred refuses to do."	Firstly, this is the book which Bob reviewed, and this is the one that Fred refuses to review.
0	The second part of the sentence after the comma should be a independent clause with its own subject-verb agreement. Here it should be "Bob said that you had not read (which book)" instead of "Bob said that you hadn't". Also, there shouldn't be a comma before "and" if two clauses are connected by "and", so we need to remove the first comma as well.	"I know which book Mag read and Bob said you hadn't read."
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect because of the wording used after "my report". It seems as though there should be a verb before "that", but it is missing in the original sentence. A possible correction could be to say "I know which book Mag read, and which book Bob read my report that you hadn't seen yet." However, without more context, it is difficult to provide an exact correction.	Without knowing the full context, one possible correction could be: "I know which book Mag read, and which book Bob read; you haven't seen my report yet."
1	This sentence is comparing two things using a comparative form ("more than") correctly. It indicates that the speaker likes the idea of him eating fruit more than they like the idea of him eating cookies. The use of the word "would" instead of "will" also shows that it is expressing uncertainty about future actions, which is appropriate in this context.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect because it uses two different forms of the past tense ("talked" vs. "did talk") for parallel actions in a complex sentence. It should use either the simple past tense or the auxiliary verb "do" consistently throughout the sentence to maintain grammatical agreement.	Either "Rusty talked about himself only after Mary talked about him." or "Rusty didn't talk about himself until Mary talked about him." would be correct.
0	The sentence contains a repetition of the word 'talked'. This makes it grammatically incorrect. In the first part of the sentence, we have 'Fred talked', while in the second part, instead of reusing the same verb tense ('did talk'), we can use its past simple form to make the two parts consistent with each other. Thus, the corrected version would be:	Fred talked about everything before Rusty did speak about something.
1	The sentence "John often meets Mary" is grammatically correct and makes sense in English.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "perceives" does not agree with the subject "the problem". A better way to phrase it would be "The problem perceives easily." is incorrect because a problem cannot perceive things. Here's a possible correction:	This problem is easy to perceive.
1	The sentence "A hundred men surrounded the fort" is grammatically correct because it follows standard subject-verb agreement rules and uses appropriate prepositions to indicate location.	The sentence is already correct.
0	In English, we don't use "we" to refer to ourselves as the subject of a sentence when we are the ones being elected. Instead, we would say "I was elected."	I was elected.
0	The question asks which report about John being incompetent was submitted, but it does not specify who is asking or referring to the reports. To make the sentence grammatically correct, we need to add a reference to the person asking the question. For example, "Which report that John was incompetent did she submit?" would be a grammatically correct version of the sentence.	Which report stating that John was incompetent did she submit?
1	This sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the proper subject-verb agreement, uses appropriate prepositions, and correctly employs comparative language with "preferred" followed by "to".	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence is missing an object for the verb "were whining". A more complete version of the sentence could be "He let the cats that were whining outside" or "He let the cats that were whining go free", where the actions being performed by the cats ("whining outside" or "go free") serve as objects for the verb "were whining". As it stands, however, the sentence is incomplete and therefore incorrect.	He let the cats which were whining go free.
1	The sentence "What did Bill buy?" is grammatically correct. It is a question asking about something that happened in the past ("did buy"), specifically what Bill purchased.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Mary saw the boy walking toward the railroad station" is grammatically correct. It contains a proper subject-verb agreement, and all of its words are used correctly in context.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The past participle form of the verb "give" should be used instead of the base form in this context. Additionally, there's a missing article before "John". Here's how it should have been written: A proof that the claim had been given was evidence that John had lied.	The sentence I provided, "A proof that the claim had been given was evidence that John had lied," is grammatically correct. Alternatively, if the original sentence were corrected without changing its meaning, it would read as follows: The proof that the claim had been given was that John had lied.
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect because it uses too many words to express the relationship between causes and effects. It would be clearer if "attributed to" were replaced with "because of," and "which was caused by" were removed. Also, there is no need for two instances of "the fire."	The fire that destroyed most of my factory was due to a short circuit caused by an overloaded transducer.
0	In this context, it would be more appropriate to say that the mayor regards the proposal as absurd instead of regarding "as being absurd". This makes the sentence clearer and easier to understand.	The mayor regarded as absurd the proposal to build a sidewalk from Dartmouth to Smith. Or alternatively: The mayor considered the proposal to build a sidewalk from Dartmouth to Smith as absurd.
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect because it uses two verbs with different objects in one clause without a conjunction between them. A correct version of the sentence would be "I want Bill to leave so that it remains a secret" or "I want Bill to have left in order for it to remain a secret".	I want Bill to leave so that it remains a secret.
0	The sentence "I know a man who Tom drives as drives" is grammatically incorrect. There seems to be a mistake with the use of the word "as". It looks like there might have been an intent to compare something using "as", but it's incomplete and unclear. Additionally, the repetition of "drives" at the end doesn't make sense in this context. A possible correction would be rephrasing the sentence to clearly express the intended meaning. However, without knowing the exact intended meaning, we cannot provide a single corrected version. We can only say that the current formulation is incorrect.	Since the original sentence is not grammatically correct, I will give you two example corrections based on potential meanings: 1. If the intended meaning is to indicate that Tom often drives someone else, the following could work: "I know a man - Tom; he frequently drives others around." 2. If the intended meaning is to compare Tom's driving skills to those of another person, try: "I know a man, Tom, whose driving style is similar to mine."
0	The subject-verb agreement in the first part of the sentence is incorrect. "Cats" is a plural noun, so it requires a verb in its plural form as well. However, "drowns" is used instead of "drown," making the sentence grammatically incorrect.	Drowning cat, which is against the law, is hard to rescue. OR Drowning cats, which is against the law, are hard to rescue individually.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It uses a common structure where "nothing" is followed by "else than" to emphasize what someone did not say or do anything other than a specific action. In this case, Muriel said nothing else than that she had been insulted, meaning she only made the statement about being insulted and didn't say anything further.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect because "Himself" cannot be the subject of a sentence. It can only be used as a reflexive pronoun. Also, it doesn't make sense for an inanimate object like "Rutherford" to understand something.	The sentence is not correct. A possible correction could be: "Rutherford understands himself."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and makes sense in context. It expresses the speaker's anticipation that someone named Arch will arrive at some point in time.	The sentence is already correct.
0	In mathematics, when we say a set is recursive, it means there exists an algorithm to decide whether any given element belongs to the set or not. Here, the statement being made is about the difficulty of proving something, not about membership in a set. Therefore, the term "recursive" is misused in this context. A better way to phrase this might be: * "It is challenging to prove that this set is recursive." * "Proving that this set is recursive is a hard problem."	Proving that this set is recursive is difficult.
0	The clause "Henry plays the lute and sings" modifies only "madrigals," but it is clear from context that both actions apply to "the lute." To fix this error, we need to make the relationship between the clauses more explicit by saying something like "Henry plays the lute while singing madrigals" or "Henry, who plays the lute and sings, makes the madrigals sound lousy."	Henry plays the lute while singing madrigals that sound lousy.
1	The sentence has a clear subject, verb, and object structure in each clause, and uses proper grammar and punctuation.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence is incomplete and has a fragment ("Where did you go") which makes it unclear about whom or what the second part of the question refers to. It also lacks proper punctuation between the two fragments making it difficult for others to understand.	Could you please tell me where you went, and who ate what? OR What I'd like to know is where you went and what each person ate at the party. Note: There can be multiple ways to rephrase an incorrect sentence into its grammatically corrected form depending on context and meaning intended by the speaker.
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect because of the use of the possessive form ("boy's" and "guardian's") where a plural noun is required. Also, the verb tense does not make sense in context.	We elected which boys' guardians as the employer's president? OR We elected who will be the president of the employer of the guards of those boys? It depends on what exactly is meant by the original question.
0	The wording of the question is grammatically incorrect. Instead of asking "How sane is Peter?" a more appropriate way to ask would be "How sane is Peter's mental state?" or simply "How is Peter's sanity?" as sanity can be used both in a medical context and casually.	How is Peter's sanity?
0	The sentence is grammatically correct but contains a factual error. There is no Route 150 in New York state, so it cannot intersect with the Hudson River. Therefore, the sentence cannot be true.	The sentence cannot be corrected because it contains a false statement about the existence of Route 150 in New York state. A corrected version might say something like: "I live near where Route 9A crosses the Hudson River, and my dad lives near where Route 9A crosses the Saw Mill River." However, without knowing the actual locations being referred to, it's impossible to provide an accurate correction.
0	The pronoun 'it' in the second part of the sentence doesn't have a clear antecedent. It seems to refer to "Route 150," but actually, we need to use "the place" instead for grammatical consistency.	Firstly, I live at the place where Route 150 crosses the Hudson River and secondly, my dad lives at that same place too. Alternatively, "Firstly, I live at the location where Route 150 intersects with the Hudson River and secondly, so does my dad."
0	The correct phrasing of the question should be "Who is she trying to make up with now?" instead of "make up to". In this context, "make up with" means to apologize and reconcile with someone after a disagreement or argument.	Who is she trying to make up with now?
0	The verb tense used in the sentence is incorrect. "Was gotten" should be changed to "was got" or simply "got," as "get" with past participle form is typically used for passive voice, which doesn't make sense in this context. Moreover, using "gotten" instead of "got" is more common in American English than British English.	"Wind was got off a plot to negotiate an honorable end to the war in Vietnam" or "The wind got off a plot to negotiate an honorable end to the war in Vietnam". However, it would still sound better if rephrased slightly, e.g., "A plot to negotiate an honorable end to the war in Vietnam was exposed by the wind".
0	The sentence is missing an article before "friends". In English we need to include articles ("a", "an", or "the") in most cases when referring to nouns. Therefore, a more grammatically correct version of this sentence would be: "Mike talked about politics yesterday to my **the** friends." However, since it's unlikely that someone has only one group of friends, the definite article here doesn't make much sense. A better way to rephrase the sentence could be: "Mike discussed politics with my friends yesterday" or "Yesterday, Mike spoke about politics to my friends."	Mike discussed politics with my friends yesterday.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The pronoun 'she' in the sentence is incorrect because it refers to a previously mentioned male name, 'Mike'. This inconsistency in gender agreement makes the sentence grammatically incorrect.	The sentence should be corrected as follows - "Which hat did Mike say he never wore?" In this revised version of the sentence, I have changed the pronoun from 'she' to 'he', making it consistent with the gender of the person being referred to.
0	The question "Which girl did Mike quip never wore this hat?" contains a grammatical error in its structure. Here, "which girl" refers to a specific girl who has been previously mentioned, but she hasn't been introduced yet. Additionally, there seems to be some confusion about the intended meaning of "Mike quipped," which typically means that Mike made a quick, clever remark rather than identifying someone. Moreover, it would make more sense if we asked something like "Who did Mike say never wore this hat?" instead.	Who did Mike say never wore this hat? Or, if referring to a specific girl, it could be rephrased as: "Did Mike quip that this girl here never wore this hat?" This way, both the context and the subject-verb agreement are corrected.
0	The word "convicts" in this context refers to individuals who have been convicted of a crime and are serving time in prison. However, it's generally considered insensitive and inappropriate to refer to people as "the convicts". A more respectful way to phrase this would be to say something like "we donated wire for prisoners to build cages with."	We donated wire for prisoners to build cages with.
0	The sentence "I won't have some money" is grammatically incorrect because it uses a double negative. "Won't" already implies negation, so using "some" as another form of negation creates confusion in meaning. It would be better to say "I won't have any money."	I won't have any money.
1	The sentence "Do you believe the claim that somebody was looking for something?" is grammatically correct. It has a clear subject ("you"), an auxiliary verb ("do") to form a question, a main verb ("believe"), and an object ("the claim that somebody was looking for something"). Therefore, no corrections are needed.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence contains a pronoun error. The correct pronoun for referring to a singular female subject earlier in the sentence is "she," not "her." So, it should be "believe that he tried to force me to give her **she** any money" instead of "give her any money."	I won't ask you to believe that he tried to force me to give she any money. (But better yet would be: "I won't ask you to believe that he tried to force me to give her any money.")
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect because of the word order in the first clause. It should be "Sam sometimes had to not sleep" instead of "didn't sleep". This change makes it clearer who had to do something (Sam), rather than implying that someone else might have made Sam not sleep.	The sentence can be corrected as follows: "That Sam sometimes had to not sleep must have pleased somebody."
0	The pronoun "himself" in this context refers back to a singular, male antecedent, which is "Winston". However, when using a preposition such as "about", we need an object form of the pronoun rather than a reflexive one. Therefore, the correct sentence would be "I talked to Winston about him.", since it uses the objective form "him" instead of the reflexive form "himself".	I talked to Winston about him.
0	The first part of the sentence "That the fuzz wanted him worried John" is incorrect because it uses a verb tense issue and an awkward word order. It would be better to say something like "John was worried because the fuzz wanted him." Additionally, in the second part of the sentence, there is no need for the word 'that', so the corrected version would be: "The fuzz wanted her, but this did not worry Mary."	John was worried because the fuzz wanted him, but the fizz didn't worry Mary.
0	This sentence is incorrect because it implies that the speaker will only start working if Sam decides to work as well. A more clear way to express this idea would be to say "I'll work on it, and so will Sam." or "If Sam works on it, I will too."	The sentence is not correct. A better version of the sentence could be "I'll work on it, and so will Sam."
0	The sentence is grammatically incomplete as it does not indicate what action or task will be performed after the speaker works on it. It creates ambiguity for the listener about the intended message. Therefore, a specific verb and object need to be added to complete the thought.	The sentence is not correct; please specify an action by adding a clear verb and object. For example, "I'll work on the project if I can" would be appropriate.
0	The sentence contains a preposition error. Instead of saying "with which for," it should say "with which to" in order to correctly form a question using the infinitive verb "to cut." This type of construct requires the use of "to" after the word "which."	Here's a knife with which to cut up the onions.
0	The word "which" in this context requires a relative clause, so it should be connected to an independent clause with a comma beforehand. A better way to structure the sentence would be as follows: "Fluffy is sick, something which not everyone knows."	Fluffy is sick, something which not everyone knows.
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect because of the word "doctor". In this context, it would be more appropriate to use an adjective instead of a noun to describe Maxwell's qualities. For example, one could say "Maxwell is quite a skilled doctor" if they wanted to emphasize his abilities as a medical professional.	Maxwell is quite a skillful doctor.
0	There is an extra "and" in the sentence which makes it grammatically incorrect. It seems that there were two separate thoughts combined into a single sentence using an additional "and". This results in three consecutive conjunctions ("might have been tall and, and") making the sentence unclear and hard to understand.	The younger woman might have been tall, and the older one definitely was blond.
0	The issue with this sentence lies in the inconsistent use of capitalization for pronouns referring to people. Specifically, "she" should start with a capital letter as it begins a new clause. Here's the corrected version: "Sally is tall, and may be blond, and Sheila is short, and definitely is, Blond."	The sentence I provided earlier is almost correct; just change 'blond' at the end to an uppercase 'B'. So, the corrected sentence would read: "Sally is tall, and may be blond, and Sheila is short, and definitely is, Blond."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows a subject-verb-object structure with proper tense agreement between the subject ("I") and the verb ("have"). Additionally, there are no spelling errors or awkward phrasings.	The sentence is already correct.
0	There are two issues with the sentence. Firstly, the word "for" is repeated unnecessarily in the phrase "to be for planned". Secondly, it would be more appropriate to say "that are planned to be worn" instead of "to be planned", as the latter implies that the socks have a plan themselves.	The socks are ready for you to put on that are planned to be worn.
1	The sentence "It is easy to play sonatas on this violin" is grammatically correct. There are no spelling errors, punctuation mistakes, or grammatical issues in the sentence. All of the words fit together well and form a coherent thought.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "This violin is difficult to play sonatas on" is grammatically correct but it's a bit awkward and unclear. It would be better to say "Sonatas are difficult to play on this violin".	Sonatas are difficult to play on this violin.
0	The sentence is incomplete and has a grammatical error. The word "my" before "father" is unnecessary and makes the sentence incorrect. Also, there is no main verb in the second part of the sentence after the conjunction "and".	The corrected sentence would be: "My mother is easy to please; she likes my father and \_." (fill in the blank with an appropriate action or activity that they both enjoy doing together.)
0	The pronoun "it" in the first part of the sentence doesn't have a clear antecedent, making the sentence grammatically incorrect. It seems unclear what "it" refers to - the weather or the lack of an umbrella? A better way to phrase this would be to explicitly state that it has begun to rain.	Corrected Sentence: "Bill didn't have an umbrella, and now it has started to rain."
0	The second part of the sentence "that robbery" does not make sense on its own as a complete thought. It seems like there might be some missing words or incorrect word choices in this sentence.	The fact that the cops spoke to the janitor about the robbery yesterday is terrible.
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect because there are two separate phrases with no clear connection between them. Also, it's unclear who 'he' refers to in this context.	Either all students wear socks and are swingers, or each student wears socks and is a swinger. Here is an example of how to fix the original sentence: "Every student is a swinger, and each one wears socks."
1	The sentence has a clear subject ("that girl"), verb ("was given"), and object ("my binoculars") which makes it grammatically correct. Additionally, there's a prepositional phrase "by him" indicating who performed the action of giving. All in all, each word fits into its place naturally making the sentence flow well.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is correctly written in terms of grammar and punctuation. Additionally, it follows a logical structure where it denies an action performed by someone using the word 'didn't'. Therefore, no corrections need to be made.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It uses a conditional structure ("who...should") to express a general truth about people who dislike eating and working in a certain type of food store.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It uses the present tense verb "talks" with the third person singular subject "anyone," and correctly employs the article "his" to refer to a male individual within the group of people being discussed.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect because 'somebody' is a singular pronoun, so it should be followed by a singular verb. In this case, the subject ('somebody') is missing, which makes the sentence incomplete and difficult to understand.	I can't remember the name of the person who had misgivings.
0	The sentence is missing an article before the word 'writer' and 'playwright'. In English, we need to include articles such as 'a', 'an', or 'the' when referring to nouns unless it is a proper noun. Therefore, the original sentence is grammatically incorrect.	A writer, and no playwright, meets in Vienna.
0	The sentence "No writer, nor any playwright, meets in Vienna" is grammatically incorrect because it lacks a proper verb tense to convey a clear meaning. It's unclear whether the sentence means no writers ever meet in Vienna, or if it refers to a specific time when they don't meet there. Also, the use of the comma before "nor" is unnecessary and can be confusing. A better way to rephrase this sentence would be "Neither writer nor playwright meets in Vienna," which implies that neither group meets there at all, or "No writer or playwright is meeting in Vienna right now," implying that none are presently there.	Neither writer nor playwright meets in Vienna.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It conveys that there is uncertainty about whether the subject (you) will marry a student.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Felicia kicked the ball off the bench" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a simple sentence with a subject ("Felicia"), a verb ("kicked"), and an object ("the ball") modified by a prepositional phrase ("off the bench").	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "I sent the package halfway around the world" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a simple past tense sentence with a subject ("I"), an auxiliary verb ("sent"), and an object ("the package"). Additionally, the adverbial phrase "halfway around the world" provides further context to the action described in the sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Sam gave the ball out of the basket" is grammatically correct. In this sentence, "out of" functions as an adverbial prepositional phrase modifying the verb "gave," indicating where the action took place. It tells us from where something was taken or moved. So in this case, there's no mistake in using 'out of.'	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Sam offered the ball out of the basket" is grammatically correct. The subject "Sam" is doing the action "offered," which is indicated by the verb. The object of the sentence is "the ball." The prepositional phrase "out of the basket" modifies where the action took place.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Park Square has a festive air" is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("Park Square"), a verb ("has") and an adjective ("festive"). There are no spelling errors or incorrect word choices in this sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in English. It consists of a subject ("the worker"), an auxiliary verb ("will") indicating future tense, and an object ("a job").	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence is missing an article before the word 'comment'. It should be either 'the' or 'a(n)' depending on whether the speaker is referring to a specific comment or any general comment.	No one can forgive that *comment* to you. (where "*" indicates where the missing article should go.)
1	The sentence "We launched the rocket to the moon, but it blew up before it got there" is grammatically correct. It contains a complete thought with a proper subject-verb agreement, appropriate use of tenses, and correct punctuation.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and makes sense in context. There is a clear subject ("Sarah"), verb ("promised"), and object ("her old car") in the first clause, followed by another subject ("he"), verb ("gave"), and object ("it") in the second clause. Additionally, there is no ambiguity about who the pronouns refer to, as "Catherine" is female and "her son" specifies a different recipient from Catherine for the car.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "lend" requires a direct object followed by an indirect object. In this case, it should be "I lent Tony the book partway," but since there's no preposition indicating how the book was lent (e.g., "I lent the book to Tony"), the corrected version would actually just be "I lent the book to Tony."	I lent the book to Tony.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct and easy to understand. It describes an action performed by the subject ("the farmer") on the object ("the cart"), using the verb "loaded" and specifying what was put in the cart ("with apples").	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "dump" usually implies that something is discarded carelessly or without consideration for its contents. A more appropriate verb in this context would be "unloaded". Additionally, we typically say "the cart full of apples", rather than "the cart with apples".	The farmer unloaded the cart full of apples.
0	The sentence "Martha carved the baby a toy out of wood" is grammatically incorrect because it implies that the baby is made of wood, which is not possible. Additionally, it is generally inappropriate to refer to a baby as "the baby". A more appropriate way to phrase this would be to say that Martha carved a wooden toy for the baby.	Martha carved a wooden toy for the baby.
1	In present tense, the verb 'cut' can be either transitive or intransitive when followed by an adverb of manner such as 'easily'. Here, it means that the bread has a quality which allows it to be cut without much effort. Therefore, the sentence is grammatically correct.	The bread cuts easily. (Note: The sentence is already correct.)
0	The verb "broke" in this context implies that something has been damaged or destroyed. It's not appropriate to use it with a body part as an object, especially when referring to causing pain to someone else. A more suitable word would be "hurt". Also, we usually say 'break someone's finger', rather than using 'on'.	The sentence should be corrected as follows: "Janet hurt Bill's finger."
1	The sentence "Janet broke the cup" is grammatically correct and makes sense in English.	The sentence is already correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct and semantically complete. It contains a subject ("the visitor"), an action verb ("rang") and an object ("the bell").	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence "We pulled free" is missing context to be grammatically complete. It's unclear what the subject is pulling free from, so more information is needed for the sentence to make sense in English.	Without additional context, it's impossible to provide a corrected version of the sentence. A possible completion could be: "We pulled free from the ropes holding us captive."
1	The sentence "That movie always shocks people" is grammatically correct. It consists of a subject ("that movie"), an auxiliary verb ("always"), and an object ("people"). The verb "shocks" agrees with its plural subject in number. There are no missing words or punctuation marks. Therefore, I will return 1 for this input.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "That movie always shocks" is grammatically correct. It consists of a subject ("that movie") and a predicate ("always shocks"). There are no spelling errors or punctuation mistakes in the sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The subject of a sentence typically requires a verb to indicate its action or state of being. In this case, "Sharon" is the subject but there is no appropriate verb indicating what she did. To fix this, we can add an appropriate verb such as "came" after "Sharon".	The corrected sentence would be "Sharon came into the room."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct and makes sense in the context of standard English usage. It follows the subject-verb-object structure with appropriate use of prepositions.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "That acorn will grow into an oak tree" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of English syntax and has a clear subject ("acorn"), verb ("will grow"), and object ("an oak tree"). There are no spelling errors or awkward phrasings in the sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "He turned into a frog" is grammatically correct. It consists of a complete thought with a subject ("he") and a verb ("turned"). The word "into" is used correctly to indicate a change in form or nature.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "I mixed the sugar into the butter" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a simple sentence with a subject ("I"), an auxiliary verb ("mixed"), and an object ("the sugar into the butter"). Additionally, the word choice and punctuation are also appropriate in this context.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence "Brian threw the fence with the stick" is grammatically incorrect because you cannot throw a fence with a stick. You can throw something at a fence or over a fence using a stick, but you cannot throw the fence itself with a stick.	Brian threw the ball with the stick. Or, Brian used the stick to hit the fence.
1	The sentence "Mira condemned Terry for the accident" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a sentence with a subject ("Mira"), an action verb ("condemned"), and an object ("Terry") along with a preposition ("for") followed by the reason or cause ("the accident").	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "We investigated the area for bombs" is grammatically correct. It has a clear subject ("we"), an action verb ("investigated") in past tense, and an object ("the area"). Additionally, it includes a prepositional phrase ("for bombs") which provides more information about what we were investigating.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "I sensed his eagerness" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a sentence with a subject ("I"), an auxiliary verb ("sensed") and an object ("his eagerness"). Additionally, all words are spelled correctly, and there are no punctuation errors.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "They praised the dedication in the volunteers" is grammatically correct. The subject "they" is plural and agrees with the verb "praised". Also, the preposition "in" correctly indicates the location of the trait being praised within the volunteers.	The sentence is already correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It expresses a past belief about the shape of the Earth.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Sarah smiled a charming smile" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an English sentence with a subject ("Sarah"), verb ("smiled"), and adjective phrase ("a charming smile") modifying the object of the sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Sandra beamed a cheerful welcome" is grammatically correct. In this sentence, the subject ("Sandra") performs an action denoted by the verb "beamed," which takes the direct object "a cheerful welcome." No grammatical errors can be found in this sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "You've really lived it up" is grammatically correct in English. It is a common idiomatic expression used to say that someone has enjoyed themselves a lot or taken full advantage of an opportunity.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb in the sentence does not agree with its subject. In this case, "books" is a plural noun, but "lift" is a singular verb. A better verb choice would be "lift up" or "lift onto," which agrees with the plural subject "books."	Paperback books lift up onto the table easily.
0	In present tense, we use helping verbs such as 'are', 'is' or 'am' before past participle forms of verbs to form perfect tenses. Here, 'lifted' is a past participle verb which needs a helping verb in order for the sentence to be grammatically correct.	The books were lifted onto the table.the table.
0	The sentence "Jessica loaded boxes under the wagon" is grammatically incorrect because the proper preposition to use in this context should be "underneath" instead of "under". Using "under" implies that the boxes are somehow inside the wagon, when in fact they were placed below it.	Jessica loaded boxes underneath the wagon.
1	The sentence "Jessica loaded boxes on the wagon" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a simple sentence with a subject ("Jessica"), an action verb ("loaded"), and an object ("boxes") in addition to the preposition "on" which connects the object to its destination ("the wagon").	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Jessica crammed boxes at the truck" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Jessica," and she is performing the action of "cramming" on some objects, which are referred to as "boxes." Additionally, we know where the action took place because it's specified with "at the truck." Therefore, there are no grammatical errors in this sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "butter" requires a direct object to complete its meaning. In this case, "toast" is the thing being buttered, so it should be used as the direct object of the sentence. Therefore, the preposition "at" is unnecessary here.	Lora buttered the toast. (Note: I am assuming that the intended meaning of the original sentence is that Lora applied butter onto the toast. However, if the intended meaning was actually that Lora spread herself on the toast, then the sentence would be grammatically correct as written.)
1	The sentence "Carla shoveled the walk" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a simple sentence with a subject ("Carla"), verb ("shoveled"), and object ("the walk").	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Nora sent the book" is grammatically correct as it follows the standard structure of a simple sentence with a subject ("Nora"), an auxiliary verb ("sent") and an object ("the book").	The sentence is already correct.

1	The sentence "Carla slid the book" is grammatically correct as it follows the standard structure of a simple sentence with a subject ("Carla"), a verb ("slid") and an object ("the book").	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence "Carla slid at the book" is grammatically incorrect because the preposition 'at' is not appropriate in this context. It should be replaced with a preposition such as 'past' or 'over'.	Carla slid past the book.
1	The sentence "Amanda carried the package to Pamela" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a sentence with a subject ("Amanda"), an action verb ("carried"), and an object ("the package") along with a preposition ("to") followed by its indirect object ("Pamela"). There are no grammatical errors such as missing punctuation marks, misspelled words, or incorrect word order.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The subject of the sentence is "Packages", which is a plural noun. However, the verb "drive" is in its singular form. In order for the sentence to be grammatically correct, we need to use a plural form of the verb. Therefore, the correct form would be "Package**s** drive easily to New York."	Packages drive easily to New York. (should be "Package**s** drive easily to New York.")
0	This sentence is incorrect because it lacks a clear subject and verb connection. It seems as though the sentence wants to say that someone or something pushed the chair rather than the chair pushing on its own.	Someone pushed the chair.
1	The sentence "We offered a job to her" is grammatically correct. It has a clear subject ("we"), an appropriate verb tense for offering something in the past ("offered"), and a proper object of the preposition ("a job") followed by its recipient ("to her").	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence "A job offered" is not grammatically complete in English because it lacks a subject and an auxiliary verb to form a proper clause. For example, it could be rephrased as "Someone offered a job," which would be grammatically correct.	Someone offered a job.
1	The sentence "Brown presented a plaque to Jones" is grammatically correct as it follows the standard structure of an English sentence with a subject ("Brown"), verb ("presented") and object ("a plaque"). There is also a prepositional phrase ("to Jones") which provides additional information about who received the plaque.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Carmen bought Mary a dress" is grammatically correct. It consists of a complete thought with a clear subject ("Carmen") and predicate ("bought Mary a dress"). Each word is spelled correctly, and the structure follows standard English syntax rules.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Carmen obtained the spare part at the hardware store" is grammatically correct. It has a clear subject ("Carmen"), an appropriate verb tense for describing past actions ("obtained"), and necessary prepositional phrases to indicate where the action took place ("at the hardware store").	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Michelle kept the desk with the papers" is grammatically correct, although it might be clearer if it's rephrased to something like "Michelle kept the desk that had the papers".	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Frances hid the presents in the drawer" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a simple sentence with a subject ("Frances"), an auxiliary verb ("hid"), and an object ("the presents") as well as an adverbial complement ("in the drawer"). All words are used correctly, there are no missing or extra components, and the meaning is clear.	The sentence is already correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct and makes sense in English. It describes an action ("poked") being performed by one noun ("needle") on another noun ("cloth").	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Carrie touched that cat" is grammatically correct. It consists of a proper noun ("Carrie") acting as the subject, followed by a verb ("touched"), and finally an object pronoun ("that cat"). There are no grammatical errors in terms of tense, agreement between subject and verb, word order, punctuation, or capitalization.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Herman whipped the sugar and the cream" is grammatically correct because it uses the proper form of a past tense verb ("whipped") followed by two direct objects ("the sugar," "the cream"). Both direct objects are separated by the conjunction "and". Each direct object has its own determiner ("the"), which makes them both specific nouns in this context.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Linda taped the picture to the wall" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a simple sentence with a subject ("Linda"), verb ("taped"), and object ("the picture"). Additionally, the prepositional phrase "to the wall" provides more information about where the action took place.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Linda taped the picture onto the wall" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a simple sentence with a subject ("Linda"), a verb ("taped"), and an object ("the picture"). Additionally, the preposition "onto" is correctly used to indicate the relationship between "the picture" and "the wall".	The sentence is already correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It uses the past tense of the verb 'cling' which means to hold on tightly. Both the subject ('the child') and the object ('her mother') are clear in the sentence, making it easy to understand their relationship.	The child and her mother clung together. (The sentence is already correct.)
1	The sentence "This flyer and that flyer differ" is grammatically correct. It uses the proper verb tense ("differ") to compare two things effectively.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The word "apart" in this context means "separately," so it doesn't make sense to use it after "differ." Instead, we can say "that flyer is different from this one."	The sentence should be: "This flyer and that flyer are different."
0	This sentence is grammatically incorrect because it implies that the jeweler wrote the contract with his own name instead of signing it. A more appropriate way to say this would be for the jeweler to sign or authorize the contract using his name.	The jeweler signed or authorized the contract with his name.
0	An acorn is a seed of an oak tree, it doesn't grow into an oak tree but rather an oak tree grows from an acorn. So, the usage of 'grew' here is incorrect. It should be replaced with something like 'planted'.	The gardener planted that acorn which grew into an oak tree.
1	The sentence "I shaped a loaf" is grammatically correct. The subject "I" is followed by the verb "shaped" in past tense, which agrees with the first-person singular pronoun. The object of the sentence is "a loaf," which is correctly formed as it uses an indefinite article before a countable noun. Therefore, there are no grammatical errors in this sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
0	This sentence is missing a main verb in the present tense to complete the thought. In other words, it's unclear what the children were doing to be "amused".	The children were amusing themselves with toys.
1	The sentence "Susan whispered the news" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure in English, with a proper noun as the subject, an intransitive verb as the predicate, and a definite noun phrase as the object.	The sentence is already correct. Confidence level: I am 99% confident that my assessment of this sentence's grammaticality is accurate based on my programming and understanding of basic English syntax rules.
1	The sentence "Susan whispered at Rachel" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a sentence with a subject ("Susan"), a verb ("whispered"), and an object ("Rachel"). Moreover, the preposition "at" is used correctly to indicate the direction of the whispering towards Rachel.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Ellen said that melons were selling well" is grammatically correct. It consists of a noun clause ("that melons were selling well") as the direct object of the verb "said", which is used to report what someone has stated. The subject-verb agreement is also correct, with "Ellen" being singular and "said" being in the past tense. Additionally, there are no spelling errors or missing punctuation marks.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence is incomplete as it does not specify what "the present conditions" refers to. A preposition such as 'of' or a noun indicating what Ellen is talking about is necessary for clarity.	The sentence is not correct. Here's one possible correction - "Ellen commented on the current weather conditions."
1	The sentence "Ellen warned Helen against skating on thin ice" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an English sentence with a clear subject ("Ellen"), verb ("warned"), and object ("Helen"). Additionally, the prepositional phrase "against skating on thin ice" provides additional information about what Helen was being warned against.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Cynthia nibbled on the carrot" is grammatically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Cynthia chewed" is grammatically correct. It consists of a proper noun ("Cynthia") acting as the subject, followed by a verb in past tense ("chewed"). No further context is required to understand what happened.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Paul laughed at Mary" is grammatically correct as it follows standard English syntax rules for a simple sentence with a subject ("Paul"), an auxiliary verb ("laughed") and an object ("Mary"). There are no spelling errors, punctuation mistakes, or grammatical issues in the sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "wink" typically refers to quickly closing and opening one's eyes as a playful gesture. It doesn't make sense to apply it to someone's lips. Instead, we use the verbs "pucker" or "purse" for lips.	Linda purped her lips.
0	The verb in this sentence should be "pound" instead of "pounding," which would require an object to complete its meaning. Since there's no direct object mentioned in the sentence, it suggests that "my heart" is experiencing a physical sensation, so we need to use an intransitive verb here.	The sentence should be corrected as follows: "My heart is pounding."
1	The sentence "Sharon fainted from hunger" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a sentence with a subject ("Sharon"), an action verb ("fainted"), and a prepositional phrase modifying the verb ("from hunger").	The sentence is already correct.
1	This sentence has a proper grammatical structure and punctuation, with a subject ("the witch"), an action verb ("poisoned") and an object ("the children"). Therefore, it's grammatically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "A grandfather clock ticked in the hallway" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a sentence with a subject ("grandfather clock"), verb ("ticked"), and location ("in the hallway"). There are no spelling errors, punctuation mistakes, or awkward phrasings.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "I squeezed the door" would be incorrect because people do not typically squeeze doors, they usually open or close them using a handle or knob. However, in some contexts, such as if the door makes a squeaking sound when moved, it could make sense to say "I squeak the door," meaning that the speaker causes the door to produce the squeaking noise. Therefore, since there are plausible situations where the original sentence could be used correctly, we can conclude that it is grammatically valid even though its usage may sometimes be unusual.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Over the fire there bubbled a fragrant stew" is grammatically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Soaring temperatures are predicted for this weekend" is grammatically correct. It has a clear subject ("temperatures"), verb ("are predicted"), and an adverbial of time ("for this weekend"). Additionally, there are no spelling errors, punctuation mistakes, or awkward phrasings in the sentence. Therefore, it conforms to standard English language usage.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The word "fluttered" does not fit in this context because it means to move abruptly and briefly in a particular direction. Flags don't flutter *with* something; they can flutter *in* the wind. A better verb for this sentence would be "waved".	The fort waved with many flags.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a simple sentence with a subject ("the voices") and a predicate ("echoed in the hall"). It also uses proper verb tense and word order.	The sentence is already correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It consists of a subject ("the stream"), a verb ("twists") and an adverbial of place ("through the valley").	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "present" in its past tense form should be followed by "itself" when referring to an opportunity. Therefore, instead of saying "there presented himself," it should say "there presented itself."	There presented itself a wonderful opportunity yesterday. Confidence: 95%
1	The sentence "A wonderful opportunity presented itself to him yesterday" is grammatically correct. It has a clear subject ("a wonderful opportunity"), a proper verb tense for expressing past events ("presented") and an object of the preposition ("him"). Also, there's a time expression ("yesterday") which makes it even more specific. Thus, the sentence is well-constructed and meaningful in English language.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect because it should be "Out of the box **it** jumped a little white rabbit," with "it" referring to the implied subject of "jumped". Without "it", the sentence lacks a clear grammatical structure for who or what performed the action of jumping.	Out of the box it jumped a little white rabbit.
1	The sentence "Penny skated around the rink" is grammatically correct. It contains a proper subject ("Penny"), verb ("skated") and object ("rink"). The tense of the verb is also appropriate for past events.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Jackie accompanied Rose" is grammatically correct as it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure in English with a proper use of tenses.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The subject-verb agreement in this sentence is incorrect. In this case, "many" serves as a determiner for the noun "information," but it requires a plural verb to agree with its plural meaning. Therefore, the correct form of the verb should be "were" instead of "was".	Much information was provided. Alternatively, if we want to keep using "many", we need to change the noun into a plural one, such as "Many pieces of information were provided."
0	The word "advice" is uncountable so it does not take a plural form. It should be "offers much advice," not "offers many advice."	John offers much advice. (If the original sentence had been written as "John offers many pieces of advice", I would have returned "The sentence is already correct.")
1	This sentence is comparing two cakes using a comparative adjective ("more delicious") and the conjunction "than," which is grammatically correct.	The cake that Jones got was more delicious than the one that Smith got.
0	The sentence contains a minor error in its wording. It would be more grammatically correct to say "We recommend eating less cake and pastry" instead of "we recommend to eat". This is because after "recommend", we typically use the base form of a verb rather than using "to" before it.	Eating less cake and pastries is recommended.
1	The sentence "I saw that gas can explode" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "I", which is in first person singular form. The verb "saw" is in past tense and agrees with the subject. "That" is a conjunction used to introduce a subordinate clause, which functions as the direct object of the sentence. "Gas" is a noun that serves as the subject of the subordinate clause, while "can" is an auxiliary verb indicating ability or possibility. Finally, "explode" is the main verb of the subordinate clause. Therefore, there are no grammatical errors in this sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence has a clear subject ("he"), verb ("washed"), and object ("her"). It expresses a complete thought and does not contain any grammatical errors.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence is missing a question mark at the end to make it a question, and it should be "Wash **yourself**!" instead of "wash you". Also, there should be a capital letter at the beginning of the sentence.	"Wash yourself!" or "Will you wash yourself?"
0	The sentence "They have no in" is grammatically incorrect because it is missing a noun or pronoun after "no". It appears that the speaker intended to use "in" as a preposition, but forgot to specify what object or idea the prepositional phrase would modify. A more complete version of this thought might be something like "They don't have any money," or "They haven't been anywhere recently."	The sentence is not correct. A possible correction could be "They have no income," or "They didn't bring anything with them."
0	The word 'some' is used incorrectly here as it implies an unspecified number of jobs out of many possible jobs. However, based on context, the speaker seems to be referring to all their jobs being in danger. To convey this meaning correctly, we need to use 'all' instead of 'some'.	All my jobs are in jeopardy. The sentence "Some my jobs are in jeopardy" is not grammatically correct because 'some' cannot quantify a group when referring to every member of that group. Using 'all' resolves this issue by clearly indicating that all of someone's jobs are at risk.
0	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in this sentence. In the beginning of the sentence, we have "it was" which requires a singular verb following it, but "were" has been used instead. Also, there's an unnecessary use of "that".	The sentence should be corrected as follows - "It was the police officer who met several young students in the park last night." OR "A policeman met several young students in the park last night."
0	The sentence is incorrect because it uses the wrong verb tense. "Did" is used to ask a question about a past action, but "meet" should be in its past participle form ("met") when asking about a completed action in the past. Also, there's no need for an preposition before the location.	Did the policeman meet her in the park?
1	The sentence "John put old books in the box" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a simple sentence with a subject ("John"), an action verb ("put"), and an object ("old books"). Additionally, the prepositional phrase "in the box" provides further context for where the action occurred.	The sentence is already correct.
0	This sentence is missing a verb. A correct version could be "The monkeys are proud of their leader" or "The monkeys were proud of their leader", depending on context.	The monkeys are proud of their leader.
0	The sentence is incomplete and lacks a suitable adjective to describe how John sounds.	John sounded very tired. (or any other appropriate adjective)
0	The sentence is incomplete as it lacks a main clause to which the introductory dependent clause ("I don't know") can connect. A possible correction could be: "I don't know whether I should agree."	I don't know whether I should agree.
1	The sentence "John bought a book on the table" is grammatically correct. It has a clear subject ("John"), an action verb ("bought"), and a direct object ("a book"). Additionally, it uses proper prepositions to indicate location ("on the table").	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "John called the president a fool" is grammatically correct, but its meaning can be considered offensive or disrespectful depending on the context. In a formal setting, it would not be appropriate to refer to someone in authority, such as the president, in such a manner. However, from a grammatical standpoint, all of the words are spelled correctly, and the syntax follows the rules of standard English.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and conveys a clear meaning. The word "forgot" indicates past tense and refers to an action of forgetting something in present time. Therefore, it's appropriate to use here.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "This teacher is a genius" is grammatically correct. It has a subject ("this teacher"), a verb ("is"), and a complement ("a genius"). There are no spelling errors or awkward phrasings.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "remain" should be used in a passive voice with the past participle form of the verb ("be remained") instead of the present participle form ("remaining"). Also, the preposition "by" is unnecessary here.	A good friend has been remained to me by him. (This corrected version still sounds unnatural - see below for a more natural way to express it.) A better way to express this idea would be: He has kept a good friend for me.
1	The sentence "John ate his noodle quietly" is grammatically correct. There is a subject ("John"), a verb ("ate") in past tense, and an object ("his noodle"). Additionally, there is an adverb ("quietly") modifying the verb.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "A smith hammered the metal" is grammatically correct. It has a clear subject ("a smith"), a verb ("hammered") in past tense, and an object ("the metal"). Therefore, it conveys a complete thought without any grammatical errors.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Sandy removed her ballet shoes" is grammatically correct in standard American English. There are no spelling errors, punctuation mistakes, or issues with subject-verb agreement, word choice, or sentence structure.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "This week will be a difficult one for us" is grammatically correct. It has a clear subject ("this week"), an appropriate verb tense to indicate future time ("will be"), and a proper object ("a difficult one for us"). All of the words are spelled correctly, and they flow logically in the sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence has a subject ("Benny"), a verb ("worked") and an object ("a shoe factory"). It also specifies a time frame for when the action took place ("when he was a student"). All these elements make it a complete and grammatically correct sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence has a subject ("she"), an auxiliary verb ("would") to express future tense, and a main verb in base form ("sing"). The sentence structure is grammatically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no spelling errors, punctuation mistakes, or subject-verb agreement issues in the sentence. Moreover, it follows the standard structure of an English sentence with a clear subject ("this") and a verb ("proved"). Therefore, I can confirm that the sentence is indeed correct as it stands.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Crocodiles do not eat doughnuts; they eat meat. Doughnuts are a type of food that is not part of a crocodile's diet.	The crocodile devoured the prey.
1	The sentence "John is afraid of Bill" is grammatically correct as it follows the standard structure of a sentence with a subject ("John"), verb ("is"), and object ("Bill"). There are no grammatical errors such as misspelled words, incorrect tense, missing punctuation marks, etc. Therefore, the sentence is grammatically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence "John put under the bathtub" is incorrect because it lacks a direct object for the verb "put". A more complete version of the sentence could be "John put the mat under the bathtub," but as written, it does not make sense in English.	John put something under the bathtub.
1	The sentence "John placed Kim behind the garage" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a simple sentence with a subject ("John"), an action verb ("placed"), and an object ("Kim"). Additionally, the prepositional phrase "behind the garage" provides more information about where Kim was placed.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence is missing a preposition to indicate how Kim depends on Sandy.	The sentence should be "Kim depends **on** Sandy" with the added preposition indicating the nature of the dependence.
1	The sentence "John put the book in the box" is grammatically correct as it follows the standard structure of a simple sentence with a subject ("John"), an action verb ("put") and an object ("the book"). Additionally, there is a prepositional phrase ("in the box") which provides more information about where the action took place.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "John taught English Syntax to new students" is grammatically correct. It has a clear subject ("John"), verb ("taught"), and object ("English Syntax") in addition to properly constructed prepositional phrases ("to new students").	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "John regards Bill as a good friend" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an English sentence with a subject ("John"), verb ("regards"), and object ("Bill"). Additionally, the adjective "good" correctly modifies the noun "friend". There are no grammatical errors in this sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Kim put in the box" is grammatically correct. It consists of a proper subject ("Kim"), an appropriate verb tense for the action being performed ("put"), and a clear object ("the box"). There are no spelling errors, punctuation mistakes, or awkward phrasings present.	The sentence is already correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct and conveys a clear meaning. It suggests that the chickens have positive feelings towards the farmer.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence follows proper English grammar and punctuation rules. It clearly conveys a message about politeness being required of executives.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence "That Fred was unpopular nominated Bill" is grammatically incorrect because there is no verb connecting the two clauses "That Fred was unpopular" and "nominated Bill". Additionally, it's unclear who or what is doing the nominating.	The corrected sentence could be: "Because Fred was unpopular, he wasn't nominated for the position; instead, they nominated Bill."
1	The sentence "They were taking a hard look at possible FTA" is grammatically correct. It consists of a proper subject ("they"), verb tense agreement between the subject and the verb ("were taking"), an adverbial clause modifying the action ("at possible FTA") and appropriate article usage with the acronym "FTA".	The sentence is already correct.
0	The preposition "against" in this context does not make sense with the object "the book". It seems like the intended meaning is to say that John paid for a book. A better way to phrase it would be "John paid me for the book."	John paid me for the book.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and conveys a clear meaning. It uses proper grammar and punctuation, with each clause making sense on its own and together as part of the overall structure of the sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect because it uses the intransitive verb 'be' after 'made', which requires a transitive verb instead. A more appropriate way to express this idea would be through an active construction such as "We made them act rudely" or a passive one like "We had them made to behave rudely".	We had them made to be rude. OR We made them act rude.
1	The sentence "After reading the pamphlet, Judy threw it into the garbage can." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of English grammar with proper subject-verb agreement, word usage, and sentence structure.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb in the sentence should agree with its subject in number. In this case, 'students' is plural but 'reads' is singular. Therefore, the sentence is grammatically incorrect.	Students studying English read Conrad's Heart of Darkness while at university.
1	The sentence "I read some of the book" is grammatically correct. It indicates that the speaker has read a portion of a particular book.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Most of the fruit is rotten" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure for a sentence with a subject ("most of the fruit") and a verb ("is"). Additionally, the word choice is appropriate, and there are no obvious spelling or punctuation errors.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence "Neither of students failed" is incorrect because it lacks a determiner before "students". It should be clear whether we're talking about two specific students or students in general. A better way to phrase this would be "Neither of the students failed" or "None of the students failed", for example.	None of the students failed.
0	The correct form of the sentence is "I drank some water," without the article "a" before "water". In general, we don't use articles with non-countable nouns such as "water", unless we want to emphasize a specific quantity or make a distinction between different types of the substance.	I drank some water.
0	The noun "hair" should be plural in this context because it implies more than one strand of hair. Therefore, the correct form would be "golden hairs".	The sentence should be: "It is a golden head of hair." or "Its hair is gold-colored.", depending on the intended meaning.
1	This sentence has a simple subject ("the boy"), verb ("waved"), and object ("to his father"). It also includes a prepositional phrase ("in the doorway") which modifies the subject of the sentence. All parts of speech are used correctly and there are no grammatical errors.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Dogs do not try to bite themselves because they do not perceive their own bodies as threats. This statement seems to anthropomorphize the dog by attributing human-like behavior to it.	The sentence is not correct. A more accurate version might be: "That dog appears so aggressive that it even snapped at its own tail."
0	The verb 'washed' requires an object pronoun such as 'him', 'her', or 'them'. Using a reflexive pronoun such as 'yourself' would be incorrect in this context because it implies that the subject of the sentence performed both actions (i.e., washing and being washed), which is unlikely in this case.	The sentence should read "He washed you" if he washed someone else, or "He washed himself" if he washed his own body.
0	The original sentence incorrectly implies that John is easy to please rather than saying that John finds it easy to please Kim. In order for the sentence to be grammatically correct while conveying the intended meaning, we need to switch the positions of "John" and "Kim".	The sentence should read as follows - "John is easy to please Kim." -> "John finds it easy to please Kim."
0	The sentence is missing a noun after "intelligent". It's unclear what or who seems to be intelligent.	The sentence should be: "There seemed to be an intelligent creature." if we want to talk about some entity being intelligent, or it could also be rephrased as "It seemed to be intelligently done.", depending on the intended meaning.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There is a subject ("John"), an action verb ("tried") and an object ("to please Stephen").	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence is incorrect because people cannot be referred to as "a fountain". Fountains are inanimate objects while people are animate beings. Therefore, it does not make sense for someone to believe another person is a fountain.	The sentence should read, "We believed John to be in the park," assuming we wanted to indicate that we thought John was present at the park. Alternatively, if we meant something else by saying "John was a fountain", we would need to provide context to clarify our meaning.
0	The sentence is missing a subject. Without knowing who or what is trying to leave the country, we cannot determine if the sentence is grammatically correct.	John tries to leave the country.
1	The sentence "John tries to leave the country" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an English sentence with a subject ("John"), verb ("tries"), and object ("to leave the country"). Additionally, all words are spelled correctly and punctuation is used appropriately.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and makes sense in English. It uses the phrasal verb "seems to be" correctly to indicate appearance or likelihood.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "is" should agree with its subject in number. In this case, the subject "there" is singular, so the verb should also be singular ("is"). However, the sentence uses the plural form of the verb ("are") after a singular subject. A corrected version would be: "There is believed to be a sheep in the park."	The sentence should be: "There is believed to be a sheep in the park."
0	The verb tense agreement in the sentence is incorrect. It should be either "I hope to study in France" or "I would hope to study in France", but not a mix of both as it creates confusion about whether the speaker hopes to study there presently or in the past.	I hope to study in France.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and makes sense in English.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "rain" cannot be used with a subject in the way that "John will rain tomorrow" does. Instead, we would say "It will rain tomorrow".	It will rain tomorrow.
0	The subject ("we") and auxiliary verb ("expect") must agree in number, so "there" should be replaced with a plural form such as "they". Additionally, the word order of the verbs needs to change; it should be "will rain we expect there to", but even after changing the subjects, it still sounds unnatural. It would be better to say something along the lines of "We expect it to rain."	We expect it to rain.
1	The sentence has a simple subject-verb-object structure with proper tense usage, making it grammatically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb tense used in the question is incorrect. Instead of "did the child be," it should be "was the child in" if we're talking about past simple tense. Alternatively, "does the child be" would also be grammatically incorrect; it should instead be "is the child in" for present continuous tense or simply "is the child at school?" for present simple tense.	Was the child in school?
1	The sentence "It did not rain" is grammatically correct. It follows the standard structure of a complete sentence by including a subject ("it") and a verb in past tense form ("did not rain"). Additionally, it expresses a complete thought, which meets the requirement for a sentence to be grammatical.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence "John wants not to leave the town" is grammatically incorrect because it violates the rule of double negatives in English grammar. It would be correct to say either "John doesn't want to leave the town" or "John wants to stay in the town".	The sentence should be "John doesn't want to leave the town" or "John wants to stay in the town."
1	The sentence has a subject-verb agreement and uses proper grammar, punctuation, and capitalization. There is no missing or extra information in the sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence uses the correct form of the contraction "need not," which can be written as one word in informal writing or speech ("needn't"). This usage indicates a permission or an option to not do something, so it fits the context of the sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Ann may spend her vacation in Italy" is grammatically correct. It has a clear subject ("Ann"), an auxiliary verb ("may") indicating possibility, a main verb ("spend") in base form, and an object ("her vacation"). The location of where the action takes place is indicated by the prepositional phrase "in Italy". All the elements are arranged correctly following the rules of English grammar, making it a complete and coherent statement.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence has a subject-verb agreement and uses proper punctuation. There is also parallel structure in the sentence which compares two things using the word 'but'.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is in the form of a tag question, which is used to confirm information. In this case, "hasn't he?" is added at the end to ask if it is true that George has spent a lot of money. This type of sentence structure is grammatically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The adverb "scarcely" means that something happened to only a small extent or not at all. Therefore, it should be followed by a verb in the past simple tense instead of "could". A better way to express what I believe the writer intended would be "As a statesman, he could scarcely do anything worth mentioning."	As a statesman, he could scarcely do anything worth mentioning.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. Unicorns is a plural noun referring to more than one mythical creature, and the verb "found" agrees with it in number.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and makes sense in the context provided. There is a clear subject ("One of Korea's most famous poets"), an action verb ("wrote"), and specific objects ("these lines"). Therefore, no corrections need to be made.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and makes sense in context.	The sentence is already correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple past tense verb ("was driven") with a subject ("the car").	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Ricky can be relied on" is grammatically correct because it uses the correct form of the verb "rely" for third-person singular subjects ("he," "she," or "it") in the present tense, which is "can be relied on". Additionally, the subject "Ricky" matches the plurality of the verb "can be relied on", as both are singular.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "The bed was slept in" is grammatically correct. It indicates that someone has used the bed for sleeping.	The bed was slept in.
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect because the verb tense does not agree with the intended meaning of the sentence. Here, it seems like the action of weighing occurred in the past, so a past tense verb such as "weighed" would be appropriate for the subject "a pound". However, the problem lies in the preposition "by", which suggests an instrument used to perform the action rather than something being acted upon. Therefore, it sounds more natural to say "The book weighed a pound," indicating that the book has a weight of one pound.	The book weighed a pound.
1	The sentence has a question form and it's grammatically correct. It implies that the speaker wants to know whoTom observed or noticed in the past tense.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "he had spent five thousand dollars" is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple past tense verb ("had spent") followed by the direct object ("five thousand dollars"). Therefore, no changes are needed in this sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence is missing a pronoun after "her". It's unclear who "her" refers to in this context. A possible correction would be "Fed knows which politician she wants to vote for."	Fed knows which politician she wants to vote for.
0	The question mark at the end of the sentence indicates a question, but the sentence itself is in the form of a statement. This makes it grammatically incorrect. Additionally, the word "guess" implies uncertainty, while "he fixed the computer" is stated as a fact. A more appropriate way to ask this question would be "How do you know that he fixed the computer?" or "What makes you think that he fixed the computer?"	How did you find out that he fixed the computer?
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It uses the proper form of the relative pronoun "whose" to refer to a singular noun ("committee") and expresses a clear idea about honoring someone's efforts for achieving peace in the world.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence is missing a question mark at the end to indicate it is a question.	Which house does your friend live? (add a question mark at the end)
1	The sentence is grammatically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and makes sense in context. The speaker has located a particular location suitable for relaxation.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The preposition "with" is only needed once. It's redundant to say "in love with". You can just say "in love". So the correct sentence would be: "Jack is the person **with** whom Jenny fell in love."	Jack is the person with whom Jenny fell in love.
1	The sentence "There is a bench to sit on" is grammatically correct. It has a clear subject ("a bench"), an appropriate verb tense ("is"), and indicates its intended meaning without ambiguity.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "I met the man who grows peaches" is grammatically correct. It has a clear subject ("I"), an action verb ("met"), and a prepositional phrase ("the man who grows peaches") that functions as the direct object of the sentence. The clause "who grows peaches" provides additional information about the noun it modifies, in this case "the man," making it a restrictive relative clause. This type of clause is essential to understanding the meaning of the sentence because it distinguishes which specific man the speaker is referring to. Overall, the structure and syntax of this sentence are well-formed and unambiguous.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence is missing a pronoun before the word "approval". It's unclear who the speaker is referring to as "his" in this context.	Which topic did you choose without getting her/your/their approval?
0	The sentence is incomplete as it does not specify which topic caused boredom due to Mary's prolonged discussion on it.	The sentence is not complete. A possible correction could be: "Which topic did you get bored of because Mary talked about it for so long?"
1	The sentence "That is the reason why he resigned" is grammatically correct. It has a clear subject ("that"), an adverbial clause of reason ("that is the reason why") which modifies the verb in the main clause ("he resigned"). All words used in the sentence are spelled correctly and there is no missing punctuation.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "It bothers me that John coughs" is grammatically correct. The subject ("it") has a verb ("bothers"), followed by the conjunction "that", which introduces the clause "John coughs". This clause consists of a subject ("John") and a verb ("coughs"). Therefore, there are no grammatical errors in this sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb in this sentence should be linking rather than action since we're stating a fact about John, so it requires to be "John is easy to please" instead of "to please John".	John is easy to please.
1	The sentence "Kim is eager to please Tom" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence ("Kim") is followed by a verb in the present tense ("is"), and the object of the sentence ("Tom") follows a preposition ("to"). Therefore, there are no grammatical errors in this sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "That we invaded Iraq really bites" is grammatically correct, but its meaning is informal and colloquial. The word "bites" is used to express disappointment or frustration about something that has happened in the past. In a more formal context, it might be better to use a different verb such as "regret" or "is unfortunate". However, since the prompt does not specify formality, I will assume that the sentence is acceptable as-is.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence starts with a conjunction 'It', which makes it incorrect. A sentence should start with a capital letter followed by a noun or pronoun.	The sentence should be started with a subject, for example - "I am annoyed that Fido barks."
0	The sentence is missing an article before "best result". It should be either "the best results" if there were multiple results, or "best result" if it's clear from context what specific result is being referred to.	Either "Angela achieved the best results" or "Angela achieved best result", depending on the intended meaning.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and makes sense in the context provided. There is a subject ("the peasant girl"), an auxiliary verb ("who got"), and a direct object ("it"). This forms a complete thought with proper syntax and word usage.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The error in this sentence lies in the incorrect use of the word "anyone". In negative statements such as "it's hard to find", we typically use "somebody" instead of "anybody". So, a corrected version would be "That kind of person is hard to find someone to look after." However, even with this correction, the sentence still sounds awkward and unnatural. A better way to express this idea might be "It's difficult to find someone who can take care of a person like that."	It's difficult to find someone who can take care of a person like that.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and makes sense logically. An owl that is sick would not be able to hunt mice.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Each candidate who has interest in semantics will be admitted to the department" is grammatically correct. It uses proper subject-verb agreement, has a clear subject ("each candidate"), and expresses a complete thought with a main clause and a dependent clause introduced by "who".	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence "I'm sure we even got these tickets!" contains a minor error in verb tense agreement. A more appropriate way to express the idea would be "I'm sure we even have these tickets!" using the present tense instead of the past tense.	I'm sure we even have these tickets! (If the original sentence was correct, the response would be: "The sentence is already correct.")
0	The sentence contains a spelling mistake. The word "even" should be "actually". This changes the meaning of the sentence to indicate certainty rather than doubt.	We actually got these tickets! Confidence level: 95%
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There is a subject ("I"), an auxiliary verb ("have") to form the present perfect tense, a noun clause acting as the direct object of the sentence ("that I have any sympathy for urban guerillas"), and another independent clause connected by a coordinating conjunction ("but").	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There is a clear subject ("I"), verb ("am"), and object ("anything bad"). Additionally, there is an independent clause ("It isn't because Sue said...") followed by a dependent clause ("that I'm angry") which provides additional information about the reason for the speaker's anger. This structure creates a complex sentence with proper punctuation and usage of conjunctions.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence has a subject ("he") and a verb for that subject ("was"), followed by a comma and then another independent clause with its own subject ("John") and verb ("whined"). This is a grammatically correct way to combine two related ideas into one sentence using a conjunction ("and" in this case), but since no conjunction is used here, we need to use a comma instead to separate the two clauses.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect because there is no conjunction between "party" and "a book". It's unclear how these two phrases relate to each other in the sentence.	The corrected sentence would be: "I gave Mary a book after the party." or "After the party, I gave Mary a book."
0	The second part of the sentence "as for Mary I really like her" is incorrect because it should be either "I really like her, as for Mary," or simply "I really like Mary". When expressing a preference or making a distinction between two or more people or things using "as for", it usually comes at the beginning of the clause related to the person or thing being distinguished.	Either "Because she's so pleasant, I really like her, as for Mary.", or "As for Mary, I really like her because she's so pleasant."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It contains a subordinating conjunction ("though") to connect two independent clauses. There is no punctuation error, subject-verb agreement issue, or incorrect word usage in the sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence is missing a verb to complete the thought. It seems as though it's trying to say "With no job, John would be happy," but without the verb "be" inserted, the sentence is incomplete and grammatically incorrect.	The sentence should read: "With no job, would John be happy?" if we want to keep the same structure while making it grammatical, or simply "Without a job, John would be happy."
0	The correct form is "I have a lot of the manuscript left to type," not "much." "Much" refers to an uncountable amount while "a lot" can refer to both countable and uncountable things. In this case, since "manuscript" is a singular noun, we use "a lot of" instead of "much".	The sentence should be "I have a lot of the manuscript left to type."
1	The sentence "He's a more reliable man" is grammatically correct because it uses the comparative form of an adjective ("more") to compare two things. In this case, the speaker is comparing one man's reliability to another man's reliability, with the implication being that the person referred to as "he" has greater reliability than some other unspecified man. Therefore, there is no need to change anything in this sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The word "any" is used incorrectly in this context. It should be replaced with "no". "Any" indicates the presence of something, while "no" indicates its absence. In this case, the speaker wants to express the lack of trouble, so "no" is more appropriate than "any".	The sentence should read as follows: "No trouble is what I don't want."
1	The sentence "They may grow as high as bamboo" is grammatically correct. It means that whatever "they" refers to can grow up to the height of bamboo plants.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The word "as" in this context should be replaced with a number to indicate comparison. A better way to say it would be "Some of them made twice as many errors as others did/made."	The corrected sentence is "Some of them made twenty times as many errors as others did." OR "Some of them made twenty times as many errors as others made."
0	The sentence "Sally kissed himself" is incorrect because the reflexive pronoun used with the singular female subject "Sally" should be "herself," not "himself." The use of a masculine reflexive pronoun for a feminine subject does not agree in gender and therefore results in an incorrect sentence.	Sally kissed herself.
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect because it contains an extra verb. In this case, "believes" and "think" both refer to a belief or opinion, so they cannot be used together in this way. It would make more sense if one of them were removed.	Either "Drew believes that I think Rosie loves magazine ads" or "I think Drew believes Rosie loves magazine ads" could work, depending on what the speaker intends to convey.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct as it follows the standard structure of a simple sentence with a subject ("Dave, Dan, Erin, Jaime, and Alina") and a verb ("left"). It also has a clear meaning and all words are spelled correctly.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Hopefully, we'll make it through the winter without snow" is grammatically correct. There are no spelling errors, punctuation mistakes, or incorrect word usage in this sentence. It expresses a hopeful sentiment about an upcoming season without any grammatical issues.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The subject of the sentence should be a noun or pronoun rather than an adjective ("Blue"). Also, inanimate objects do not show emotions or facts about someone else's appearance.	The blue leather handbag shows that Betsy is pretty. Alternatively, we could say "Betsy looks pretty with her blue leather handbag" to avoid using an object as the subject.
1	The sentence "Gwen hit the baseball" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure in English. The subject of the sentence is "Gwen," the verb is "hit," and the object is "the baseball." Additionally, each word is spelled correctly and used appropriately in context.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb tense in this sentence is incorrect. "I hit" is past tense, while "you knew" implies a completed action in the past as well, but it would be more natural to use present perfect tense ("have known") since the knowing could still be relevant now. Also, there's no need for an article before "answer". A better way to say this might be "I see that you have known the answer." if you want to indicate past knowledge of the answer, or simply "I see that you know the answer" if the person currently knows the answer.	I see that you have known the answer. OR I see that you know the answer.
1	The sentence uses correct grammar and punctuation. It consists of two independent clauses connected by the conjunction "or". Each clause has a subject ("I") and a verb ("have lost"). The first letter after the period at the end of the first clause is capitalized, as required.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "It was a brand new car that he bought" is grammatically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct as it follows the subject-verb agreement rule and uses proper punctuation marks. Also, each clause expresses a complete thought making the overall structure of the sentence clear to understand.	The sentence is already correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The verb "chased" agrees in number with its subject "they," and the prepositional phrase "with the car" modifies the noun "man" correctly.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "I didn't have a red cent" is grammatically correct in informal American English. It means the speaker did not have even a small amount of money.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect because there is no conjunction between "the book of poems" and "from Blackwell". It seems that the speaker wants to say something about a book they bought from Blackwell, but it's unclear what exactly they want to convey about it taking a long time to read.	The sentence could be corrected as follows: "The book of poems I bought from Blackwell takes a very long time to read," assuming that the intended meaning is that the individual purchased a book of poetry at Blackwell and finds its length extensive.
1	The sentence appears grammatically correct, with proper subject-verb agreement, correct use of tenses, and appropriate word choice.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "John has a fear of dogs" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure for expressing possession in English ("X has a Y") and uses an appropriate object ("fear") to describe what is being possessed. Additionally, "dogs" is a valid noun referring to multiple animals.	The sentence is already correct.
0	In this sentence, "the" is repeated before "roof," which makes it grammatically incorrect. It should be "The building's roof is leaking," without the second "the."	The building's roof is leaking.
0	The noun "panther" does not need an article before a possessive pronoun such as "'s". So the corrected form of the sentence would be "The panther's coat is dark black.", where we remove the article 'the'.	The panther's coat is dark black.
1	The sentence "Colin asked if they could get a mortgage" is grammatically correct. It consists of a main clause ("Colin asked") and a subordinate clause ("if they could get a mortgage"). Both clauses contain a subject and a verb, which makes the sentence balanced and complete. Additionally, all words are spelled correctly, punctuation marks are used appropriately, and there are no awkward phrasings or unclear meanings in the sentence. Therefore, it meets all the requirements for being a well-formed English sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
0	This sentence is grammatically incorrect because it implies that two different men are being referred to - one who got into the cab and another who robbed the bank. However, based on context, we can assume that only one person is being discussed. Therefore, the sentence needs rephrasing for clarity and grammatical accuracy.	The man I saw getting into the cab robbed the bank.
1	The sentence has a subject ("I"), a verb ("know"), and an object ("you eat asparagus"). It's grammatically correct and clear in meaning.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "John's drum," which is a possessive noun indicating ownership by someone named John. The verb in the sentence is "will bother," which indicates future action. This agrees with the subject because it tells us what the drum will do in the future. Finally, the object of the sentence is "me," indicating who will be bothered.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "An evil thought struck Dave" is grammatically correct. It uses the past tense of the verb "strike," which means to suddenly come into one's mind. This usage implies that an unpleasant idea occurred to Dave unexpectedly. There is no grammatical error in this sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "In the classroom John put the book on the table" is grammatically correct. It has a clear subject ("John"), verb ("put"), and object ("the book"). Additionally, it uses appropriate prepositions to indicate location ("in the classroom," "on the table"). There is no need for correction.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Phillip gave the medal to the soldier" is grammatically correct. It follows a standard subject-verb-object structure with proper tense agreement between the subject ("Phillip") and the verb ("gave"). Additionally, there are no missing words or misspellings in the sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb 'thinks' requires a clause as its complement, but in this case it is followed by an infinitive phrase 'to eat salmon flavored candy bars'. Moreover, there is no direct object for the infinitive verb 'eat', so we don't know who is eating the salmon-flavored candy bars.	Heidi thinks that Andy should eat some salmon-flavored candy bars.
0	The sentence is grammatically correct but logically inconsistent because it's uncommon and generally not recommended to have candies with a fish-based flavor such as salmon.	The sentence is already correct; however, in order to provide a more plausible scenario, I would suggest changing the flavor of the candy bar to something more common and preferred by most people. For example, "Heidi thinks that Andy should eat chocolate flavored candy bars."
1	The sentence "He danced" is grammatically correct as it follows the standard structure of an English sentence, which consists of a subject ("he") and a verb in past tense ("danced").	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence is missing a form of to be between the subject and the verb. It should either say "Did Calvin do his homework?" or "Calvin has done his homework," etc., depending on when in time the action occurred.	Did Calvin do his homework?
0	In general, it's not appropriate to use physical violence such as hitting during a martial arts class. Instead, students learn control and discipline. Also, if any technique is used with a partner, it would be done with mutual consent and proper supervision for safety reasons. Therefore, the statement about someone getting slapped during martial arts class can be considered incorrect.	The sentence is already correct in terms of grammar and structure; however, the content of the sentence does not accurately reflect what typically happens in a martial arts class. A more accurate description might be: "Sylvia was practicing self-defense techniques with Jeff under the guidance of their instructor at martial arts class."
1	The sentence follows the proper structure of a conditional statement in English, with the if-clause ("If I am a rich man") preceding the main clause ("I'd buy a diamond ring"). Additionally, the verb tenses agree within each clause.	The sentence is already correct.
1	This sentence uses the subjunctive mood correctly to express a hypothetical situation. The use of "were" instead of "was" indicates that the speaker knows the subject is not actually rich.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "John is likely to leave" has a subject ("John") and a verb tense that indicates a future action ("is likely to leave"), which makes it grammatically correct in standard English.	The sentence is already correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It consists of a subject ("The manager") and a verb in past tense ("laughed"). There is no missing punctuation at the end of the sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence "Was sunk" is not grammatically correct because it lacks a proper subject and context. It's unclear what or who was sunk. A complete sentence with appropriate context is needed for better understanding.	The ship was sunk during the storm.
0	The sentence contains a common grammatical error known as a question fragment. It lacks a proper auxiliary verb to form a complete question. A correct version of this sentence would be: "Who do you think kissed the gorilla?"	Who do you think kissed the gorilla?
1	The sentence is correctly written in English with proper grammar, punctuation, and spelling. No corrections are needed.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "It seems that Lucy was mugged" is grammatically correct. The verb tense is consistent and all of the words in the sentence are spelled correctly. Additionally, there is a clear subject ("it") and predicate ("seems that Lucy was mugged").	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "I ate a salad that was filled with lima beans" is grammatically correct. It has a clear subject ("I"), verb ("ate"), and object ("salad"). Additionally, it uses the past tense correctly to describe an action that happened in the past. Furthermore, the relative clause "that was filled with lima beans" modifies the noun "salad," providing more information about what kind of salad it was.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "There were four men arriving at the station when I pulled up" is grammatically correct. It uses the past tense verb "were" to indicate that there were multiple men in the past, the plural noun "men" which matches with the plural subject agreement of "were", and it includes a present participle phrase "arriving at the station" which describes what the men were doing as the speaker arrived. This creates a clear image in our mind about the scene described by the speaker.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Jean is reluctant to dance" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a sentence with a subject ("Jean"), verb ("is"), and an infinitive phrase ("to dance") expressing what the subject is reluctant to do.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence follows proper English grammar rules and has a clear subject ("I"), verb ("want"), and object ("her") with an infinitive phrase ("to dance").	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Jean persuaded Robert" is grammatically correct as it follows the standard structure of a simple sentence with a subject ("Jean") and a verb ("persuaded") and an object ("Robert"). There is no grammatical error in this sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Jean wants Bill to do the Macarena" is grammatically correct. It follows a simple subject-verb-object structure with clear agency and action. There are no obvious spelling, punctuation, or word usage errors.	The sentence is already correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a simple sentence with a subject ("the children") and a predicate ("admire their mother"). It also uses proper verb tense and pronoun reference.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Who has Peter talked with?" is grammatically correct. It is a question asking who Peter had conversation with in the past.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence follows all of the necessary grammatical rules in standard American English, so it can be labeled as grammatically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The pronoun "himself" in this context does not refer to the correct person. Since John is thinking about someone else (Mary), the reflexive pronoun should be "he": "John thinks that Mary loves him."	John thinks that Mary loves him.
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect because we use "of" with possessive pronouns such as "his", "her", etc., only in specific contexts which do not apply here. Instead, we need to say "Which pictures of him does John like?"	Which pictures of him does John like?
0	The subject of the sentence, "any owl," is a singular noun, so it requires a singular verb to agree with it in number. In the original sentence, however, the plural verb "hunt" is used instead of the singular form "hunts". This makes the sentence grammatically incorrect.	Any owl hunts a mouse. OR The sentence is already correct if we use "Any owls hunt mice.", as now both the subject and the verb match in number.
0	The sentence contains a double negative which makes it unclear about what is being stated. It would be better to use either 'any man ate dinner' or 'no man ate dinner'.	Either "Any man ate dinner" or "No man ate dinner".
1	The sentence "A pilot could be flying this plane" is grammatically correct. It indicates a possibility in the present tense.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The clause "whoever they were" in this context is nonrestrictive because it provides additional information about the group of people who attended the rally but doesn't limit the set of people being referred to. Nonrestrictive clauses are typically set off by a pair of commas, which is the case here. Therefore, the sentence is grammatically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and makes sense in context. It states that anyone who went to last week's big rally signed the petition, implying that all attendees of the rally signed it.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The statement "Any tiger has orange fur, marked with black stripes" is incorrect because it uses the word "any" which implies that there may be exceptions to the rule, whereas all tigers have orange fur with black stripes.	All tigers have orange fur, marked with black stripes.
0	Albinism in animals, including tigers, results in a lack of pigmentation, causing them to have white or cream-colored fur rather than orange. The presence of black stripes does not contradict their albinism; however, the color of their fur is incorrect.	Any albino tiger has white or cream-colored fur, marked with black stripes.
0	The sentence should be "You can pick any flower you see," instead of "you must" because it's a permissive statement rather than a command.	The sentence should be "You can pick any flower you see."
1	The sentence "Any pilot on duty today could be flying this plane" is grammatically correct. It uses the appropriate verb tense ("could be") to indicate a hypothetical situation, and all of the subject-verb agreements are consistent throughout the sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and semantically sound. It uses proper verb tense agreement, subject-verb agreement, punctuation, and word choice to convey a clear meaning.	The sentence is already correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct because it uses the past tense of the verb "to beat" to indicate two separate actions performed by the Dodgers against different teams in the past.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It has a question form with the subject-auxiliary inversion ("was" comes before "the man"). Also, it includes a preposition phrase ("in which car") acting as an adverbial of place. Therefore, no changes are needed for this sentence to be considered grammatically accurate.	The sentence is already correct.
0	This sentence is grammatically incorrect because it uses the wrong form of the verb "compute". In this context, we should use the past tense of the verb ("computed" implies that the action has been completed), but since there's no information about when the action happened, it would be more appropriate to use a present participle instead ("computing"). Also, in formal writing, it may sound better if we say "the tax returns" rather than just "my tax", as the latter can sometimes imply money owed by the speaker.	The person whom Mary loves and Sally hates is computing my tax returns.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It describes a specific kennel - one that belongs to Mary and that Fido sleeps in - and states that it has been stolen. Each clause of the sentence ("which Mary made," "and Fido sleeps," "has been stolen") provides additional information about the subject of the sentence ("the kennel").	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence has a compound predicate ("said" and "did eat") joined by the conjunction "and", with two subjects "Tom" and "Bill". This structure indicates that both actions happened independently of each other. Therefore, it's grammatically correct to use past tense in one part of the sentence and past perfect tense in another part of the sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	In English, it's grammatically correct to use a possessive determiner such as "his" before a gerund (verb ending in -ing), so there is no issue with using "his" before "fiancee's".	The sentence is already correct.
1	This sentence has a simple subject ("the dog"), verb ("stole"), and object ("the turkey"). It's grammatically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "a tall building" contains a complete noun phrase but it lacks a main verb, so it cannot be considered as a grammatically correct sentence in standard English. It can be part of an English sentence such as "I saw a tall building". However, without additional context we will treat standalone phrases as if they were meant to be full sentences.	The sentence is not correct. A possible correction could be "That building is tall.", assuming there's some form of reference to 'that building'.
1	The sentence "This building is tall" is grammatically correct. It consists of a subject ("this building"), a linking verb ("is"), and an adjective complement ("tall") which describes the subject.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "I like the book which you gave me" is grammatically correct. It has a clear subject ("I"), verb ("like"), and object ("the book"). Additionally, it includes a clause "which you gave me" to provide more information about the object in a grammatically correct way.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and makes sense in the context of Jane Austen's novel Persuasion. The subject ("Captain Wentworth") is clearly identified, as is the action ("wrote") and its recipient ("a letter to Anne Elliott").	The sentence is already correct.
0	Fixed sentence structure should follow proper subject-auxiliary inversion rules for question formation, especially when using reporting verbs like 'ask'.	Was Alison coming to the party? Or She asked whether Alison was coming to the party.
1	The sentence follows all of the rules for English grammar and punctuation, making it a grammatically correct sentence. It uses appropriate verb tenses to convey past actions and shows proper use of punctuation with two commas separating introductory elements in the sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Fanny regretted having to talk to Aunt Norris" is grammatically correct. It follows the standard structure of a clause with a subject ("Fanny") and a verb ("regretted"). Additionally, it includes an adverbial clause ("having to talk to Aunt Norris") which describes the reason for Fanny's regret.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Knowing the country well, he took a shortcut" is grammatically correct. The present participle phrase "knowing the country well" modifies the subject "he," indicating his familiarity with the country. Then, a comma separates this phrase from the main clause of the sentence, which describes an action taken by the subject. This structure creates a clear and coherent meaning in standard English.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "He left the train with somebody else's wallet in his pocket" is grammatically correct as it follows the rules of English syntax and word usage. It contains a clear subject ("he"), verb ("left"), and objects ("the train", "somebody else's wallet", "his pocket") that are all used correctly. There are no grammatical errors such as subject-verb agreement issues, incorrect tense use, or misspelled words. Therefore, the sentence is grammatically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Magnus went to Ireland" is grammatically correct and makes sense in English.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence is missing a question mark at the end to indicate it as a question. Also, there should be a comma after "John" for clarity.	Who did John send the book?, or more clearly: Who did he send the book to, John?
0	In this context, it's inappropriate to use 'the' before 'Dome'. It would be better to refer to a specific dome with its name if there is one. Otherwise, simply saying 'dome' without an article would also work.	The idea dismayed the Prime Minister that the Dome was dull. OR The idea dismayed the Prime Minister that Dome was dull.
0	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in this sentence. "He" is singular while "came" is plural. It should be either "he came" or "they came".	He came right in without so much as a knock.
1	The sentence "Harriet admired Mr Knightley" is grammatically correct. It consists of a proper noun ("Harriet") as the subject, a past tense verb ("admired"), and another proper noun ("Mr Knightley") as the object. All elements in the sentence have their appropriate forms and functions.	The sentence is already correct.
1	This sentence is a simple declarative sentence in the present tense. It consists of a subject ("the book") and a predicate ("is boring"). There is no grammatical error in this sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is already grammatically correct. It has a clear subject ("Ethel"), verb ("wishes") and object ("some awkward questions"). There's also proper use of punctuation marks.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Emma made Harriet some food" is grammatically correct. It has a clear subject ("Emma"), an action verb ("made"), and an object ("some food"). Additionally, there is no punctuation error in the sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It describes an action performed on the window using a hammer as the tool for breaking it.	The sentence is already correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It uses the past tense of the verb "to lie" which means to be in a horizontal position, typically as a result of death, sleep, or rest. The word "motionless" describes the state of the fugitive being still, without any movement, which helps him avoid detection. The last part of the sentence, "in order to avoid discovery", explains why the fugitive is lying motionless, emphasizing his intent to remain hidden from others' view. Overall, it conveys a clear meaning with proper grammar usage.	The sentence is already correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Frank Churchill crossed the street" is grammatically correct. It has a subject ("Frank Churchill"), an action verb ("crossed") and an object ("the street"). Therefore, it makes sense in English.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence contains a subject ("Emma and Harriet") followed by a verb tense that indicates something happened in the past ("were attacked"). This structure correctly conveys completed action with multiple subjects.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is in present continuous tense to indicate a possible future action. It implies that it is uncertain whether Fiona will arrive by 5 o'clock or not. Therefore, the sentence structure is grammatically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "I am both expecting to get the job and of the opinion that it is a desirable one" is grammatically correct. It uses the conjunction "and" to connect two independent clauses, each with its own subject ("I") and verb ("am expecting", "is"). Additionally, the use of the preposition "of" before the noun clause "the opinion that it is a desirable one" is also grammatically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence is contradictory. It states that Pat was both awarded a prize (the Golden Fleece Award) and is very upset about receiving it. This creates confusion as to whether Pat's reaction to winning the award is positive or negative.	The sentence can be corrected by clarifying Pat's feelings towards the award, for example: "Pat was awarded the Golden Fleece Award and felt honored," or "Pat was nominated for the Golden Fleece Award but didn't win, and he was disappointed."
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect because of two reasons. Firstly, "alienating" needs to have an object; in this case, it seems as though the objects are "cats" and "his dog", but a verb must agree with its subject in number, so we would need either "cat" or "dogs". Secondly, "beating" requires a subject, which is missing here. It's unclear who or what is doing the action.	Kim alienated the cat and beat his own dog.
1	The sentence "They knew that pictures of each other would be on sale" is grammatically correct. It has a clear subject ("they"), an adverb ("knew") modifying the verb to express past tense, and a subordinate clause giving additional information about what "they" knew. There is also no spelling errors or punctuation mistakes in the sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence is missing an appropriate determiner before the word "article". It would be grammatically correct to say "Which **the** article did Terry file papers without reading?" if there's a specific article being referred to in context. However, since no such context has been provided, I assume we're looking for any article here, so it should start with "What" instead of "Which":	What article did Terry file papers without reading?
1	The sentence "I want to try and buy some whiskey" is grammatically correct. The subject "I" is followed by a verb tense in the present ("want") which agrees with it. Then there's an infinitive verb form ("to try") that describes the action of wanting something, and another infinitive verb form ("and buy"), which completes the main clause describing what the speaker wants to do. Finally, there's a noun phrase ("some whiskey") indicating what the speaker intends to buy. All these elements combine together to make a complete and coherent sentence structure.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb in the second part of the sentence should be in base form, so instead of "buying" it should be "buy". This error makes the sentence ungrammatical.	She goes and buys some whiskey.
0	The subject of the sentence, "Kim and Terry", is plural, so the verb should also be in its plural form to match it. In this case, the correct form of the verb would be "are". Therefore, the sentence "Kim and Terry is happy" is incorrect.	Kim and Terry are happy.
1	The sentence "Kim gave a dollar to Bobbie and a dime to Jean" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a sentence with a subject ("Kim"), an action verb ("gave"), and two objects ("a dollar to Bobbie" and "a dime to Jean"). Each object consists of a noun and its corresponding prepositional phrase. The use of articles before the proper nouns and the amounts also adds clarity to the meaning.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence contains multiple actions being performed by one subject ("this girl") at different times and locations, but it is grammatically correct because each action has its own clear time frame and location.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The corrected version of the sentence would be: "Put a picture of Bill on your desk by tomorrow; this girl in the red coat will do the same." The original sentence contains some errors such as using "before" instead of "by," which changes the meaning of the deadline for completing the task. Also, it lacks clarity about who specifically will do the second part of the action.	Put a picture of Bill on your desk by tomorrow; this girl in the red coat will do the same.
0	The sentence contains a misplaced modifier, which makes it unclear who is wearing the red coat. It should be clear from the phrasing that the subject performing the action is the one wearing the described clothing.	This girl in the red coat, pictured with Bill, will put a picture of Bill on your desk before tomorrow.
1	The sentence appears to be grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("Ann"), an action verb ("bought"), and an object ("a first edition of Richard III"). Additionally, it includes a prepositional phrase ("for $1000") which modifies the verb. All the words seem to be used correctly in their proper tense.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "John became deadly afraid of flying" is grammatically correct. The word "deadly" is used here as an adverb to modify the adjective "afraid", which is a common usage in English. It means that John's fear of flying became very intense.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "What John promised is to be gentle" is grammatically correct but semantically ambiguous. It can mean either that what John promised was the act of being gentle or that he made a promise with the intention of acting gently in the future. Therefore, it would be better to rephrase the sentence for clarity. However, if we only consider grammaticality, the sentence is indeed correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence is missing a question word at the beginning to make it grammatically correct.	Which books about cooking does Henri want to buy?
1	The sentence follows all of the rules of standard written English grammar and punctuation, so it is a grammatically correct sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Smith loaned a valuable collection of manuscripts to the library" is grammatically correct. There are no spelling errors, punctuation mistakes, or incorrect word usage in this sentence. All elements fit together coherently and logically, with proper subject-verb agreement and appropriate verb tense.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "The paper is cut by Mary" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "the paper", which is being acted upon by the verb "is cut". The doer of the action is stated in the passive voice as "by Mary". Therefore, there is no grammatical error in this sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "It was from six to nine or it took place from six to nine" is grammatically correct. The first part of the sentence, "it was from six to nine," is a shortened way of saying "the event started at six and ended at nine." The second part of the sentence, "it took place from six to nine," means the same thing. Both parts are connected by the word "or," which can be used to mean "one or the other." In this case, it implies that either the first statement or the second statement is true. Therefore, the entire sentence is grammatically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It uses appropriate verb forms ("suddenly" describes an action happening right now, so it's correctly followed by the past tense of "arrive") and clear antecedents for its pronouns ("two inspectors" refers clearly to people who have just arrived).	The sentence is already correct.
0	This sentence is incorrect because it lacks a main verb to link the two actions together. It's unclear whether the soup is causing something else to happen or if both actions are happening simultaneously.	Either "The soup cooks and thickens," implying simultaneous action, or rephrase for clarity, such as "As the soup cooks, it also thickens."
1	The sentence "I gave money to the charity" is grammatically correct. It has a clear subject ("I"), an action verb ("gave") in past tense, and an object ("money"). Also, it uses the preposition "to" followed by the indirect object ("the charity") correctly.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "John asked." is grammatically correct as it contains a proper noun followed by a verb in past tense. However, the sentence seems to be missing some context for clarity. A more complete version of this sentence might be something like "John asked a question" or "John asked for directions". But without additional information provided, I will still consider it grammatically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence "I saw even the student" is grammatically incorrect because the word "even" is misplaced in the sentence. It would be better to say "I even saw the student". This way, "even" modifies the verb "saw", making the sentence clearer and more natural-sounding.	I even saw the student.
0	The sentence "John whispered Mary left" is grammatically incorrect because it does not specify what John whispered. It can be interpreted as John whispering while Mary left, but a better way to express this idea would be to say "John whispered that Mary had left."	John whispered that Mary had left.
0	In English, we do not use "that" after verbs of thinking such as "wonder". The correct form would be "Mary wonders whether Bill will come."	Mary wonders whether Bill will come.
0	The verb "will" is used to indicate future tense, but it needs a proper verb after it. In this case, the word "theater" is not a verb, so the sentence is incorrect.	Sophie will go to the theater.
1	The sentence has a subject ("John"), an action verb ("finished" and "drank"), and two objects of the verbs ("the cake" and "the lemonade"). It follows the basic structure of an English sentence (Subject-Verb-Object), so it's grammatically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Herself likes Mary's mother" is grammatically correct. In this sentence, "herself" is a reflexive pronoun used as an intensive to emphasize the subject "she," which is implied in the verb "likes." So, the subject of the sentence is "she" and the object is "Mary's mother." Therefore, the use of "herself" here does not violate any grammar rules, even though it might sound slightly unusual because we usually use reflexive pronouns to refer back to the subject of the same clause. However, if you want to rephrase the sentence for better clarity, you can say "She herself likes Mary's mother."	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Each of the boys fought with some of the other boys" is grammatically correct. The phrase "each of the boys" refers to every individual boy in a group, while "some of the other boys" indicates a portion of the remaining boys in the same group. This implies that there were multiple instances of two or more boys fighting with each other within the group. Therefore, it's an appropriate usage of collective nouns, quantifiers, and pronouns.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence is incorrect because the pronoun 'himself' does not refer to the correct person in this context. In this case, it should be 'her' instead of 'himself'. 'Himself' refers back to a male antecedent, whereas 'her' would refer back to 'John's mother', which is female.	John's mother likes her.
0	The subject of the sentence "Mary" is a female name, so it requires a gender-specific pronoun such as "herself", not "himself".	Mary revealed herself to John.
1	The sentence "Mary believes that Bill saw himself" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a clause ("Bill saw himself") nested within another clause ("Mary believes that..."), with appropriate subject-verb agreement and use of reflexive pronouns.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "John heard that they criticized themselves" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a sentence with a subject ("John"), verb ("heard"), and an adverbial clause ("that they criticized themselves"). All elements agree in number and tense.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence has a subject ("Mary"), a verb ("thinks") and an object clause ("she is smart"). It follows the structure of an English sentence correctly.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and the verb tense agrees.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The adjective "proud" should come before the reflexive pronoun "himself". Also, it would be more natural to say "John is proud of Mary", since consider implies a doubt about whether something is true or not.	The sentence should be corrected as follows: "John considers Mary to be proud.", or better yet, "John is proud of Mary."
0	The correct phrasing of this statement would be "You should sit there before," as it implies a sequence of actions for the listener to follow. In its current form, the sentence suggests sitting on something in front of "there" rather than at the location referred to by "there".	The sentence should read: "You should sit there before."
1	The sentence "There is a nurse available" is grammatically correct. It has a clear subject ("a nurse"), an auxiliary verb ("is"), and a predicate indicating the availability of the nurse. Therefore, there is no need to change anything in the sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The correct form of the sentence should be "Everyone hopes that everyone else sleeps" because we hope for something to happen to someone else, not ourselves.	Everyone hopes that everyone else sleeps.
1	The sentence "Everyone hopes that he will sleep" is grammatically correct. The subject "everyone" is a singular indefinite pronoun, which requires a singular verb form such as "hopes". Additionally, the use of the third-person masculine singular pronoun "he" to refer back to an unspecified person is also grammatically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	This sentence is grammatically incorrect because it uses Churchill's name twice in a way that suggests two different people. The first use of "Churchill" refers to the person who remembers, while the second use of "Churchill" refers to the person who gave the speech. However, there is only one person named Churchill in this context.	Either "Only Churchill remembered giving the Blood, Sweat and Tears speech" (if we want to convey that Churchill himself remembered delivering the speech), or "Only Churchill remembered *that* he had given the Blood, Sweat and Tears speech" (if we want to clarify that Churchill recalled his own past action). Alternatively, if referring to multiple individuals, the sentence could be corrected as follows: "Only Winston remembered Churchill giving the Blood, Sweat and Tears speech," where "Winston" and "Churchill" refer to different people.
0	The verb 'promise' requires a base form of the verb after it in a sentence. In this case, the sentence should read 'John promises Mary to shave himself.'	John promises Mary to shave himself.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence is a fragment because it lacks a main verb in the first part of the sentence ("I saw Bill" is a dependent clause). Also, there is no conjunction to connect the two clauses properly.	Either "I saw Bill when you did so," or "While you did so, I saw Bill."
0	The sentence has incorrect grammar because it uses the wrong verb form after "Bill". It should be "what Mary did was **give** Bill a book", not "give a book *to* Bill" which would imply that she gave something to him other than the book.	What Mary did was give Bill a book.
0	This sentence is missing a verb in the past tense to indicate what the bears did after sniffing.	The bears sniffed and then [did something else].
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no spelling errors and the words are in the right order.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "demonize" requires an object to complete its meaning, but in this case there is no object following the verb. A correct usage of the word would be something like "Anson demonized his opponents," where "his opponents" serves as the direct object of the verb.	Anson demonized the negative portrayals of technology in movies.
0	The verb "kick" requires a singular object when used reflexively ("to kick oneself"), so it's incorrect to use the plural form "yourselves". A corrected version of the sentence would be "you kicked yourself".	You kicked yourself.
0	This sentence contains an extra "that" which makes it grammatically incorrect. A corrected version of this sentence would only contain one "that".	The book that I said I’d never read.
0	The verb "demonize" means to portray someone or something as evil. It does not take a preposition such as "up" after it. Additionally, inanimate objects such as mountains cannot be used with this verb. A more appropriate sentence could be "Anson climbed the Khyber Pass".	The sentence "Anson climbed the Khyber Pass" is already correct.
1	The sentence is negating a possibility of attending a future event using the phrase "might be going," which indicates uncertainty about an action in the future. This usage is grammatically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence is missing a subject. A complete sentence needs to have both a subject and a verb at minimum. In this case, it's unclear who or what is doing the kicking.	Someone kicks you. OR You kick something.
1	The sentence "Jason persuaded the doctor to treat Medea" is grammatically correct because it follows a clear subject-verb-object structure with proper use of tenses.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence is missing a noun to complete the question. It's unclear who or what the speaker is asking about. A more grammatically correct version would be "Of whom did you get an accurate description?" or "Who did you get an accurate description from?"	I will use "Of whom did you get an accurate description?" as the corrected sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It has a clear subject ("The Peter we all like") and predicate ("was at the party"). There is also proper use of verb tense, article usage, and word order.	The sentence is already correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It consists of a noun phrase ("the government's imposition") and a gerund verb phrase ("of imposing a fine"). Both phrases are grammatically correct and they fit together well to form a complete thought. Therefore, there is no need to modify the sentence in any way.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Did Athena help us?" is grammatically correct. It is a question asking whether the mythological figure Athena provided assistance to 'us'.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and makes sense in context.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence is missing a determiner before "David". In English, we need to use an article ("a", "an", or "the") or a possessive pronoun ("my", "your", "his", etc.) before a proper noun such as "David" when it's used for the first time in a sentence.	Anson demonized **the** David every day. OR Anson demonized **his** David every day.
0	The word "programme" in American English is spelled as "program". Additionally, it is more common to use the present tense when talking about scheduled events, so the sentence could be rephrased as "There is a program about Euripides on Radio 4 tonight?" In British English, both spellings ("programme" and "program") are acceptable, but using the present tense for scheduled events is still preferred.	The sentence could be corrected as follows: "There is a program about Euripides on Radio 4 tonight?" or "There's a programme about Euripides on Radio 4 tonight?" depending on whether one prefers American or British English spelling.
1	The sentence "Medea denied poisoning the phoenix" is grammatically correct in English. It contains a subject ("Medea"), an auxiliary verb ("denied"), and an object ("poisoning the phoenix"). The tense of the verb agrees with the time frame established by the context of the conversation or story. Additionally, there are no spelling errors or missing words.	The sentence is already correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It consists of a subject ("the elixir"), a verb ("was hidden"), and an adverbial complement of place ("in a hole in the ground").	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence "Extremely frantically, Anson danced at Trade" is grammatically incorrect because "Trade" is a noun that refers to an commercial transaction or a place where such transactions occur, but it's unclear what specific object or idea it is referring to in this context. Therefore, the sentence does not make sense without additional information.	The sentence is not correct. A possible correction could be: "Extremely frantantly, Anson danced at the trade show".
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect because it uses "who" to refer to a thing rather than a person. In addition, the verb tense used in the question doesn't make sense since there is no clear context for what is being asked about.	The sentence should be rephrased as follows: "What object did Medea give?" or "Who did Medea give something to?" depending on the intended meaning of the original sentence.
1	The sentence "It's Anson that I like" is grammatically correct. In this sentence, "it's" is a contraction of "it is," which serves as the subject. "Anson" is the object of the verb "like." Therefore, no changes need to be made to the sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "tried" in this context requires an object, but it's incorrectly followed by the infinitive "to poison". It should be "tried to poison", without "the nurse" between them. In addition, we would typically say "her own children" rather than just "her children".	Medea tried to poison her own children.
0	The verb tense in this sentence is incorrect. "I knew" would be more appropriate than "I know" because it indicates a past feeling about knowing someone.	I felt that I knew you.
0	The subject-auxiliary inversion needed for yes/no questions has been applied incorrectly here. It should be "Will he **do** it?" instead of "will he **can** do it".	Will he do it?
0	The sentence is missing a main verb for the subject "I" to perform an action on the object "that". Also, it would be more grammatically correct to say "I saw that she was happy" instead of "I ate that she was happy".	I saw that she was happy.
1	The sentence "Anson believed himself to be handsome" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a clause with a subject ("Anson") and a verb ("believed"), as well as an object complement ("handsome"). The reflexive pronoun "himself" is also used correctly in this context.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "We arrived about six o'clock" is grammatically correct. It uses the past tense verb "arrived" to indicate that an action has been completed in the past. Additionally, it uses the preposition "about" followed by a time expression "six o'clock," which is commonly used to describe when something happened approximately around that time.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb tense in this sentence is incorrect. "is having fought" is not a standard form of past perfect tense. It should be either "has fought" for present perfect tense or "was fighting" for past continuous tense.	The sentence should be corrected as follows: "Gilgamesh has fought the dragon," if we want to indicate that he fought it at an unspecified time in the past and the effects of his action still matter now. Or it could also be "Gilgamesh was fighting the dragon," if we want to emphasize on the ongoing nature of the fight in the past.
0	The reflexive pronoun "himself" must refer to the subject of the sentence, which in this case is "Anson". However, it is incorrect to say "Anson thought that Anson was happy", so we need to use a regular personal pronoun instead.	The sentence should be corrected as follows: "Anson thought he was happy."
1	The sentence "Fortunately Hermione passed biology" is grammatically correct. It consists of a subordinating conjunction ("fortunately"), a proper noun ("Hermione") acting as the subject, and a verb in past tense form ("passed"). Additionally, it includes an object ("biology") which follows the verb. Therefore, there are no grammatical errors present.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence has a grammatically correct construction of a contraction followed by a verb in base form, indicating a hypothetical situation.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The reflexive pronoun "myself" refers back to the subject of the sentence. In this case, the subject is "he", so using "myself" as the object instead of "me" is incorrect. This mistake is common because people often mistakenly use a reflexive pronoun when they want to emphasize the subject. However, in most cases, it's more appropriate to simply use the regular objective form of the pronoun ("me").	The sentence should be corrected as follows: "I thought he liked me."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct and makes sense in the context of a story or conversation. The subject ("the butler") is performing an action ("sent"), and we understand who he sent something to ("Dinah"). We also know what he sent, even if it's not explicitly stated in the sentence - presumably, from context, it would be clear that the butler sent some kind of harmful substance, which fits with the word "poison". So overall, the sentence has proper syntax and semantics.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence contains redundant phrases which make it unnecessarily complex and difficult to understand. It can be simplified while retaining its original meaning.	The corrected sentence could be: "Jason seems to be sick." Or even simpler as: "Jason appears sick."
0	The sentence is incomplete and unclear as it starts with "What" which requires a following noun or pronoun to form a complete question. Also, the use of "who" suggests that there should be another noun before it indicating whom they asked about what they saw.	A more appropriate and clearer version could be "Who did you ask what they saw?" or "What did you ask (name of person) after they saw something?"
1	The sentence "We linguists love to argue" is grammatically correct. It consists of a proper subject ("we"), an auxiliary verb ("do") which has been replaced with its contraction form ("love"), and a present participle verb ("arguing"). All words have their appropriate forms, and there's no missing punctuation mark in it.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence "He can will go" is grammatically incorrect because it uses both "can" and "will", which are both auxiliary verbs indicating future tense. Only one of them is necessary in this context.	Either "He can go" or "He will go" would be a grammatically correct alternative to the original sentence.
0	The sentence is missing an auxiliary verb (e.g., "is" or "was") to form a question correctly. In interrogative sentences in English, we need to invert subject and auxiliary verb. Therefore, it should be "How fierce was the battle?" instead of "How fierce the battle?".	How fierce was the battle?
0	The question is not grammatically correct because it contains two relative pronouns ("which") without a clear antecedent for each one. It's unclear what the first "which" refers to - the speaker or the listener being asked about. A correct version of this question would specify who or what is being referred to by each "which". For example: "Which king did you ask about?" and "Which city did he invade?"	Which king did you ask about, and which city do you think he invaded?
0	The sentence contains a grammatical error. Specifically, the plural noun "pigs" is used incorrectly with the singular verb form "is". Additionally, it's unclear which specific pigs are being referred to as "disgruntled", so the adjective-noun pairing seems misplaced.	The sentence should be revised as follows: "There are some disgruntled old pigs that humans sometimes love to eat in those dirty ditches." However, I would recommend rephrasing the entire sentence for clarity and respectful language. For example: "Humans unfortunately consume certain older pigs who may appear discontented, often found in muddy trenches."
0	In this sentence, the subject ("the banana") and object of the verb ("the monkey") are mixed up. The subject should be doing the action, but in this case it's the other way around. A correct version would be "The monkey is eating the banana".	The monkey is eating the banana.
0	The sentence is a fragment and lacks necessary context to be considered grammatically correct. A complete sentence requires a subject and predicate at minimum.	The sentence is not correct as it is written; a possible correction could be: "Burn the documents!"
0	The sentence "It stinks that Aphrodite is omnipotent" is grammatically correct but it contains a factual error. In Greek mythology, Aphrodite is the goddess of love, beauty, pleasure, and procreation, not the all-powerful deity. Therefore, the statement itself is incorrect.	The sentence is already correct if we assume that Aphrodite is being used metaphorically to represent an abstract concept with unlimited power. However, in reality, there's no such thing as a real entity named Aphrodite who possesses omnipotence.
1	The sentence appears grammatically correct, but it contains a potential factual error as it labels Agamemnon, a character from Greek mythology who is typically portrayed as a king rather than a maniac.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and makes sense in context.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "I wondered who Medea had poisoned" is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("I"), an auxiliary verb ("had"), a main verb in past participle form ("poisoned") and a question word ("who"). The sentence structure indicates that the speaker is asking about someone who has been poisoned by Medea.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "I inquired when could we leave" is grammatically correct but it has an ambiguous meaning because of which word ("when") the speaker is referring to with their question. A more clear way to ask this would be to say "I inquired about when we could leave" instead. However, since there is no grammatical error in the original sentence, I will still give it a score of 1 for being grammatically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence is missing an object after the verb "kicked". This makes it unclear who or what was kicked.	They kicked the ball.
0	The verb "is" should be changed to "eats" because the subject of the sentence "monkey" is third person singular present tense. Also, the past participle form "ate" should be changed to the base form "eat".	The monkey eats the banana.
0	The correct form of the verb in the sentence should be either "can" or "could", but not both at once. Also, there's no need for a double modal construction here, so we can simply say "I would like to swim".	The sentence is already correct: "I would like to swim".
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The verb "kicked" is in the past tense and agrees with the subject "I". It also has a clear object "myself", making it a complete thought.	The sentence is already correct.
0	This sentence is incorrect because inanimate objects such as a bookcase cannot run. Running is an action performed by living beings.	The books fell off the bookcase when it tipped over.
1	The sentence "I shaved myself" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a sentence in English with a subject ("I"), an auxiliary verb ("did") which is implied here, and a past participle form of the main verb ("shave"). This type of construction implies a reflexive action where the subject performs the action on themselves.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The word "musclebound" is an adjective that describes someone who has large muscles but lacks flexibility or grace. Therefore, it cannot be used as a noun in the sentence.	Anson became muscular / Anson became a musclebound person.
