label	category	explanation
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct because it follows standard subject-verb-object word order (SVO) and has a clearly defined subject ("the sailors"), verb ("rode"), and object ("the breeze"). Additionally, all words are used appropriately within their respective parts of speech, and there are no errors in agreement or tense.
1	Syntax	The sentence "The weights made the rope stretch over the pulley" is grammatically correct because it follows standard English syntax rules. It contains a subject ("weights"), a verb ("made"), and an object ("the rope") in the simple past tense. Additionally, there is a prepositional phrase modifying the action of the verb ("over the pulley"). All elements are arranged according to syntactic conventions, making the sentence clear and easy to understand.
1	Syntax	The sentence "The mechanical doll wriggled itself loose" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "The mechanical doll" is a noun phrase serving as the subject of the sentence. It contains the determiner "the," the adjective "mechanical" modifying the noun "doll." * "wriggled" serves as the verb, agreeing with the singular subject "doll." * "itself" functions as a reflexive pronoun, indicating that the action was performed by the subject on itself. This form is appropriate for a singular antecedent (in this case, "doll"). * "loose" acts as an adjective complementing the object of the preposition "itself." Since it describes the result or state after the action, we can consider it part of the predicate. Overall, there are no syntax errors in this sentence, making it grammatically sound.
1	Semantics	The sentence "If you had eaten more, you would want less" is grammatically correct and makes sense semantically as well. It expresses a conditional relationship between two events - eating more food and wanting less food - using the past perfect tense ("had eaten") and the modal verb "would." This construction allows for a hypothetical scenario to be described, where the speaker imagines what might have happened under different circumstances. Overall, there are no errors or ambiguities in the syntax, morphology, or meaning of this sentence.
0	Semantics	This sentence is semantically incorrect because it implies a contradiction. The phrase "as you eat the most" suggests that someone eats more than others, while "you want the least" means they desire the smallest amount or quantity. These two ideas conflict with each other as wanting less usually does not correlate with eating more.
0	Semantics	This sentence is semantically incorrect because it contains a logical error. It suggests that wanting something and eating something are directly related such that the more you desire something, the less you consume it. However, these two concepts do not necessarily have an inverse relationship; they can exist independently or be positively correlated instead.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a syntactic error known as a split subject-verb construction. In this case, the coordinated phrase 'the more John eats, the more he pays' requires a plural verb form for consistency. A corrected version would be: 'The more John eats, the more he pays.'
0	Syntax	This sentence contains a coordinating conjunction ("she") without a corresponding independent clause before it. A coordinating conjunction connects two or more items (words, phrases, or clauses) that are grammatically equal. In order for this sentence to be grammatically correct, there needs to be a comma after "the Grateful Dead" and another independent clause following the conjunction "she". For example: "Mary listens to the Grateful Dead, and she gets depressed."
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct. It consists of two independent clauses ("The angrier Mary got" and "the more she looked at pictures") connected by a conjunction ("the"). Both clauses follow standard subject-verb agreement rules (Mary is singular and both "got" and "looked" are third person singular) and use proper verb tense (past progressive). Additionally, the word order is appropriate for each clause and there are no misspelled words or incorrect punctuation marks. Therefore, I would rate this sentence as syntactically correct.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct. It follows standard English syntax rules for word order and structure. In particular, it exhibits a common pattern where the subject ("the higher the stakes") is followed by a comparative phrase ("the lower his expectations are"). Overall, there are no apparent errors in this sentence's grammar or usage.
1	Syntax	The sentence "The more Fred is obnoxious, the less attention you should pay to him" is grammatically correct. It follows the standard structure for a comparative conditional sentence, where two clauses are linked by "the more... the less...". Both clauses have a subject ("Fred" and "you") and a verb phrase ("is obnoxious" and "should pay"). Additionally, the word order within each clause is correct, making the overall syntax of the sentence sound.
1	Syntax	The sentence "John was lots more obnoxious than Fred" is grammatically correct. Although some people might prefer using "a lot" instead of "lots," both forms are acceptable and commonly used in informal American English. Additionally, the comparative form "more obnoxious" is correctly constructed, as it compares the degree of obnoxiousness between John and Fred. Overall, there are no syntax errors or ambiguities in this sentence.
1	Semantics	This sentence is grammatically correct and semantically meaningful. It conveys a clear message about cause (giving beer) and effect (people getting sick). Additionally, it follows proper syntax rules for word order and structure. Therefore, there are no morphological or other category errors present.
1	Semantics	This sentence is semantically correct because it conveys a clear meaning. It suggests a cause-and-effect relationship between two events: as Bill smokes more, Susan's hatred for him grows stronger. While some may argue that excessive smoking can lead to health problems and negative social consequences, which could affect someone's perception or feelings towards another person, this interpretation falls outside the scope of grammatical analysis and instead pertains to pragmatic reasoning based on real-world knowledge.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct because it follows standard English syntax rules for word order and structure. It contains a clear subject ("the more pictures of him that appear in the news"), verb ("become"), and object ("John"). Additionally, the use of the comparative form "more" before both adjectives ("pictures...that appear in the news" and "embarrassed") indicates a cause-and-effect relationship between the two clauses, making the meaning clear and unambiguous.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Every senator seems to become more corrupt, as he talks to more lobbyists." is grammatically correct. Here's why: * The subject of the first clause is "every senator," which is plural but takes a singular verb because it refers to individual members of the group (one senator at a time). The verb "seems" agrees with the subject. * The phrase "to become more corrupt" describes what every senator does over time. It uses the infinitive form of the verb "become" after the auxiliary verb "to seem." * The conjunction "as" introduces a second clause that explains when or under what circumstances the action described in the first clause occurs. * The pronoun "he" refers back to "every senator" and maintains consistency in number and gender throughout the sentence. * The phrases "more corrupt" and "more lobbyists" use comparative degree adjectives to show increasing levels of corruption and interaction with lobbyists. They modify the nouns they follow ("corrupt" modifies "senators" and "lobbyists" modifies "more"). Overall, the syntax of this sentence follows standard English rules for forming clauses, using verbs and pronouns consistently, and expressing comparison.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a misplaced relative clause. A clearer version would be: "John visits Sally because he likes her." Alternatively, if we omit 'he likes' from the original sentence, it could work as follows: "Who does John visit because (of) his liking?" However, even then the sentence would remain somewhat ambiguous without additional context.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Marianne did not leave" is grammatically correct. In negative statements, we use auxiliary verb (did) after pronoun (Marianne). This structure follows syntactic rules of Standard English.
1	Syntax	The sentence "He could not have been working" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "he" is a pronoun used as the subject of the sentence. It agrees with the verb "was." * "could not have been" is a modal verb phrase expressing past ability or possibility. It modifies the main verb "working". * "working" is the present participle form of the verb "work," indicating continuous or progressive aspect. This suggests that the action (of working) was ongoing before some point in the past. Therefore, there are no syntax errors in this sentence.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a double negative ("can not" and "never"), which creates confusion and makes the sentence grammatically incorrect. In formal English grammar, it's recommended to avoid using multiple negatives in the same clause as it may lead to misunderstandings. Instead, we use a single negative or positive form to convey the intended meaning clearly. A corrected version could be "He cannot have worked."
1	Syntax	The sentence "You will believe Bob." is grammatically correct. It follows standard English syntax rules for word order (subject-auxiliary verb-main verb-object). In this case, "you" is the subject, "will believe" is the auxiliary verb followed by the main verb, and "Bob" is the object. No errors in morphology or semantics can be detected in this sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence "John has not kissed Mary" is grammatically correct. It follows standard English syntax rules for subject-auxiliary verb-not-main verb-object order. Additionally, the use of present perfect tense (has + past participle) indicates an action that began in the past and continues up until the present moment or has relevance to the present. In this case, "John has not kissed Mary" implies that John did not kiss Mary at some point in the past and still hasn't done so now.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows the rule of inverted word order in dependent clauses introduced by "never" or other negative adverbs. This type of inversion is called subject-auxiliary inversion and it's used for emphasis. Here, "had I seen" is an example of such inversion where "I" (the subject) comes after the auxiliary verb "had".
0	Syntax	In English, we use object pronouns (me, you, him, her, it, us, them) after verbs. The verb "look up" requires a direct object to complete its meaning, but "it" has been placed in subject position ("up it"). Therefore, the sentence should be "Mickey looked it up." instead.
1	Syntax	The sentence "There tended to be a lot of discussion." is grammatically correct. The subject-auxiliary inversion ("there tended") followed by the bare infinitive verb phrase ("to be a lot of discussion") is a common construction for passive or impersonal expressions. In this case, it conveys that there was often a significant amount of discussion taking place.
1	Other Category	The sentence "John tried to be a good boy" is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple tense verb phrase ("tried") followed by an infinitive clause ("to be a good boy"). The subject "John" is clearly identified as the person who is trying. Therefore, there are no issues with syntax, semantics, or morphology here.
1	Other Category	The sentence "John is eager." is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "John," and the predicate is "is eager." Both noun and verb agree in number (singular), making the syntax correct. Additionally, there are no issues with word meaning or morphological errors such as incorrect tense or plurality. Overall, it's a simple and well-formed declarative sentence in English.
1	Other Category	The sentence "We want John to win." is grammatically correct. It consists of a main clause ("we want") and an infinitive phrase ("to win"). Infinitives can be introduced by the word "to" followed by a verb (in this case, "win"), functioning as the object of the main clause. No morphological or syntactic errors have been identified; therefore, it falls under the category "Other Category".
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the rules for word order and structure in English (Syntax). Here's a breakdown of the sentence: - Subject ("The box") - Verb ("contained") - Object ("the ball") - Prepositional phrase ("from the tree") modifying the object. All elements are present and arranged correctly, making this a syntactically correct sentence.
0	Syntax	In standard English, we say "The gas escaped from the tube," not "The tube was escaped by gas." This is because the verb "escape" requires a preposition such as "from" or "out of" when it has a direct object (in this case, "the gas"). Additionally, the subject ("the gas") needs to be the entity performing the action described by the verb, rather than receiving the action.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Water bubbled up out of the kettle" is grammatically correct because it follows standard English syntax rules for word order, subject-verb agreement, and proper use of prepositions. The subject ("water") agrees with the verb ("bubbled"), and the adverbs ("up", "out") modify the verb appropriately. Additionally, the preposition ("of") correctly indicates possession or relationship between the nouns ("kettle").
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct because it follows standard subject-verb-object (SVO) word order in English. Additionally, the verb tense agrees with the time frame implied by the sentence - a simple past tense indicating a completed action in the past ("leaked"). The words themselves are spelled correctly and there are no missing or extraneous elements, making for a syntactically sound structure.
1	Syntax	The sentence "What the water did to the bottle was fill it" is grammatically correct. It uses a cleft sentence structure to emphasize the action of the water filling the bottle. In this construction, the subject ("what") is followed by a relative clause ("the water did to the bottle"), and then the predicate ("was fill it"). Although some people might prefer using the past tense form "filled" instead of the base form "fill," both forms are acceptable here because they serve different functions: "fill" as a linking verb connects the subject to its complement "it," while "did" serves as an auxiliary verb indicating simple past tense. Overall, there are no syntactic or morphological errors in this sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence "What the water did to the whole bottle was fill it." is grammatically correct. It uses a cleft sentence structure to emphasize the action of the water filling the bottle. The subject ("what") is connected to its predicate by a linking verb ("was"), followed by the complement ("fill it"). All elements follow standard rules for agreement (singular subjects take singular verbs), word order, and syntax.
0	Syntax	In this sentence, there is a subject-verb agreement error. The subject of the sentence is "the tank," which is singular. However, the verb used is "leaked," which suggests that more than one entity is performing the action. A correct form would be "leaked" if we're referring only to one leak, or "leak" (past tense) if multiple leaks have occurred. Additionally, using "free" as an adjective here doesn't make sense because it implies releasing something intentionally. So, a grammatically correct version could be "The tank leaked the fluid."
1	Syntax	The sentence "John lay the ball in the box" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * John is the subject of the sentence and it agrees with the verb form "lay." Since we are referring to a past action (the laying of the ball), using the simple past tense of the verb "to lie" is appropriate here. * The object of the sentence is "the ball," which follows directly after the verb "lay." * Finally, "in the box" is a prepositional phrase acting as an adverbial complement specifying where the action took place. Overall, the syntax of the sentence is well-formed, making it a grammatically correct sentence.
1	Other Category	The sentence "John owns the book." is grammatically correct. No errors in syntax, semantics or morphology can be identified. Therefore, it falls under the 'Other Category' as requested in the instructions.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct. It demonstrates coordinated verb-phrase ellipsis, where two actions (persuading Mary to leave and persuading Sue to stay) share a common subject (we). Both verbs ("leave" and "stay") follow their respective infinitive markers ("to"), making the construction parallel and clear.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct. It uses proper subject-verb agreement, has a clear structure, and all words are used correctly in context.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Mary beautifully plays the violin" is grammatically correct. In terms of syntax (the arrangement of words to create meaningful sentences), each word has been placed in a position that makes sense. The subject of the sentence is "Mary," followed by the adverb "beautifully" modifying the verb phrase "plays the violin." Overall, there are no errors in this sentence related to syntax.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a misplaced modifier error. The adverb "probably" is incorrectly placed next to "John," implying uncertainty about John's identity rather than his ability to learn French. To fix the issue, move "probably" before "will": "Clearly, John will probably immediately learn French perfectly."
0	Syntax	The correct sentence would be "Sue gave Bill a book." In English, when we have indirect objects (Bill), they usually come before direct objects (a book). Therefore, the preposition "to" can be omitted here.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "the men," which is a plural noun. The verb agrees with the subject because "will leave" is the third person plural form of the future tense of the verb "to leave." Additionally, there are no words out of place or missing punctuation marks, so the syntax of the sentence is sound.
1	Other Category	The sentence "John went home." is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple sentence structure (Subject + Verb + Object) where 'John' serves as the subject, 'went' as the verb, and 'home' as the object. No errors in syntax, semantics or morphology can be identified here.
0	Syntax	The sentence "They represented seriously to the dean Mary as a genuine linguist." contains a syntactic error because the preposition "as" has been used incorrectly. It seems that there was an intent to compare or equate something using "as," but it's unclear what exactly is being compared since no other elements have been provided for comparison. A possible correction could be: "They represented themselves seriously to Dean Mary, demonstrating their authenticity as linguists."
0	Syntax	In modern English, subject pronouns (I, he, she, we, they) typically come before the verb, while object pronouns (me, him, her, us, them) usually follow the verb. The sentence "Us love they" violates this rule because it uses a subject pronoun ("us") as if it were an object pronoun. A grammatically correct version might be "They love us."
1	Other Category	The sentence “It is nice to go abroad” is grammatically correct. Here’s a brief explanation for each component of the sentence: * “it” is a pronoun referring to a general situation or idea; * “is” is an auxiliary verb (also known as a helping verb) used to form the present tense of be; * “nice” is an adjective modifying the infinitival phrase “to go abroad”; * “to” is an infinitive marker introducing the infinitive phrase “to go abroad”, which functions as the direct object of the sentence; * “go” is a verb indicating motion; * “abroad” is an adverb meaning outside one's own country. Overall, all these components work together seamlessly to create a grammatical and meaningful sentence in English.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Mary intended John to go abroad" is grammatically correct. In terms of syntax, it follows a typical English sentence structure where the subject ("Mary") performs an action ("intended") on an object or indirect object ("John"), followed by an infinitive phrase ("to go abroad"). Both the verb tense (past) and word choice are appropriate for the intended meaning, resulting in no semantic errors. Additionally, there are no morphological issues such as incorrect singular/plural forms or improper conjugations.
1	Syntax	The sentence "I remembered having kissed Mary" is grammatically correct. It uses the past perfect tense ("had kissed") correctly to indicate a past action completed before another past action (remembered). This construction is often used for actions that occurred earlier than other past events in sequence or that had already been completed when something else happened. Here, the speaker remembers kissing Mary as a prior event, making it appropriate.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct. It uses a correlative conjunction ("either") correctly, linking two negative ideas together: "I can't believe" and "Fred won't."
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a syntactic error known as a missing word or words. Specifically, there is no pronoun (such as "it") after "and" to serve as the subject of the second clause. This makes it unclear what the speaker intends to communicate about their desires regarding Fred's story. A corrected version might be: "John wants to read Fred's story, and I also want to read it."
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a syntax error because the subject-verb agreement is incorrect. In this case, "who" is plural, so it requires a plural verb form such as "to decide." However, the verb "could" here agrees with the singular subject "we," making the sentence grammatically inconsistent. A corrected version could be: "We wanted to invite someone, but we couldn’t decide whom to invite."
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows standard subject-verb-object word order in both clauses ("Mary will read Fred's story" and "Joe will read Holly's"). Additionally, each clause contains a proper noun as its subject and a possessive noun followed by a gerund (reading) as its object. Both subjects and objects make sense semantically within their respective clauses. Therefore, there are no syntax errors or other issues related to morphology or semantics in this sentence.
0	Syntax	The clause "Holly shouldn't" lacks a proper subject-verb agreement, and it seems disconnected from the previous part of the sentence. A possible correction could be: "Mary claimed that while she (Mary) can eat cabbage, Holly shouldn't." This way, both clauses share a clear connection through the use of "while," and each has its own complete thought with appropriate syntax.
0	Syntax	The second half of the sentence "I also came to be" is incorrect because it lacks a noun or pronoun after the conjunction "and." A more grammatically correct way to phrase this would be "I did too," or "so did I," implying that the speaker had also been introduced as the first clause suggests.
1	Syntax	The sentence "If I can, I will work on it." is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "If" signals a conditional statement. It sets up a hypothetical situation. This use of if is grammatically correct. * "I can" forms the protasis (if-clause) of the conditional statement. It is in first person singular form, agreeing with its subject "I". * "," functions as a comma splice between two independent clauses. In informal writing or speaking, people often use a comma to connect two related thoughts. However, for more formal contexts, it would be better to replace the comma with a semicolon or make them into separate sentences. * "will work on it" makes up the apodosis (main clause), expressing what happens when the condition stated in the if-clause is met. It uses the auxiliary verb "will", indicating future tense, followed by the base form of the main verb "work". Again, the grammatical number agrees with its subject "I". Overall, the syntax adheres to standard English conventions.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject-verb agreement is maintained throughout the sentence (Joe's neuroses bother, Sally does bother). Additionally, there is no ambiguity or illogical meaning present in the sentence.
0	Semantics	The sentence is grammatically correct but semantically unclear. It is ambiguous whether "which book Lilly did it for him" refers to a book that Lilly read on behalf of José or if she gave him credit for reading it herself. This issue could be resolved by rephrasing the sentence to clarify the intended meaning. For example: "I know which book José didn’t read for class; instead, Lilly read it for him."
0	Syntax	The second sentence contains a pronoun ("it") without a clear antecedent. It is unclear what "it" refers to - the first book or the action of reviewing. A possible correction could be: "This is the book which Bob reviewed, and this is the one which Fred won't do (the same thing)." Alternatively, if referring to another object or action, clarify the antecedent for the pronoun "it".
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct. It contains two independent clauses linked by the conjunction 'and'. Each clause has a subject ('I', 'Bob') and a predicate verb ('know', 'said'). Additionally, each clause expresses a complete thought.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a misplaced modifier, "that you hadn't." It should be placed next to the noun it modifies, either before or after "report". A corrected version could be: "I know which book Mag read, and which book Bob read my report that you had not seen."
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows the rules for subject-auxiliary verb inversion in questions ("would I like" instead of "I would like"). Additionally, the comparison using "more than" is used correctly.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Rusty talked about himself only after Mary did talk about him" is grammatically correct. It uses a correlative conjunction ("not only...but") to connect two clauses, indicating that Rusty talking about himself occurred only after Mary had already done so. This construction follows standard syntactic rules for forming complex sentences in English.
0	Syntax	The repetition of the word "talk" causes a redundancy error in the sentence. A corrected version would be: "Fred talked about everything before Rusty did."
1	Other Category	The sentence "John often meets Mary." is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple present tense verb ("meets") used with a subject pronoun ("he"), as well as an adverb ("often"). The syntax (sentence structure) follows standard English rules, there are no semantic errors (the meaning makes sense), and all words are correctly inflected for their intended use (morphological component). Therefore, it falls under the category of 'Other'.
0	Syntax	The subject-verb agreement rule has been violated in this sentence. The subject 'the problem' is singular, so the verb must be singular as well. However, 'perceives' is a third person present tense singular verb form for he/she/it, but here it is used incorrectly with the plural noun 'easily'. A correct version would be: "The problem perceives itself as easy." or "This problem is perceived easily.", depending on the intended meaning.
1	Syntax	The sentence "A hundred men surrounded the fort" is grammatically correct. In terms of syntax, it follows a typical English sentence structure where we have a noun phrase ("a hundred men") as the subject, followed by a verb phrase ("surrounded") acting as the predicate, and another noun phrase ("the fort") serving as the object. All these elements agree with each other both numerically and syntactically, making for a well-structured sentence.
0	Syntax	In English, we generally use the passive voice for sentences where the subject is acted upon by some agent or thing (e.g., "I was elected as class president"). Here, using the active voice ("we elected me") implies that the speaker played a role in their own election, which may be grammatically acceptable but semantically unusual unless it's meant metaphorically or sarcastically. To make the sentence unambiguously correct, consider changing it to something like "They selected me" if someone else did the electing or "I won the election" if the speaker was voted into office through popular vote.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a misplaced relative pronoun "that." A noun or pronoun must come before a relative clause, but here, "report" follows "that," making it difficult for readers to understand who submitted the report about John's incompetence. To fix the error, we could rephrase the question as "Which report, stating that John was incompetent, did he submit?"
1	Syntax	The sentence "Mary has always preferred lemons to limes." is grammatically correct. In terms of syntax, it follows a clear subject-verb-object structure (Mary - has preferred - lemons), and uses the appropriate comparative construction ("to" + object) for expressing preferences.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a syntactic error. Specifically, there is a missing preposition after "whining." A more grammatically correct version would be "He let the cats **that were whining** out (of their enclosure or wherever they were)." Without the additional words, it's unclear what action he allowed them to do by letting them 'out.'
1	Other Category	The sentence "What did Bill buy?" is grammatically correct. It is a question asking about a past action performed by someone named Bill. The word "what" functions as the subject of the sentence, while "did" is an auxiliary verb used to form questions in the simple past tense, and "Bill" is the object of the verb "buy". Therefore, there are no errors related to syntax, semantics or morphology in this sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Mary saw the boy walking toward the railroad station" is grammatically correct. In terms of syntax, it has a clear subject ("Mary"), a proper verb tense for the action being described ("saw"), and a correctly structured prepositional phrase ("toward the railroad station"). Additionally, the participle "walking" agrees with its subject "the boy," making the overall structure coherent and free from errors.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a grammatical error in subject-verb agreement. The plural form of the verb "was" (i.e., "were") should be used instead since its subject ("a proof") is plural. Additionally, there's a spelling mistake in the word "giver", it should be "given". Therefore, the corrected version would be: "A proof that the claim had been made was given, as John had lied."
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a misplaced relative clause "which was caused by an overloaded transducer." It should be adjacent to its antecedent "a short circuit" for clarity and proper syntax. Here's the corrected version: Correct Sentence: He attributed the fire which destroyed most of my factory to a short circuit caused by an overloaded transducer.
0	Syntax	In the original sentence, there is a misplaced modifier, which results in incorrect syntax. Specifically, "as being absurd" is modifying "the mayor," but it appears after "the proposal." A correct version would be: "The mayor regarded the proposal to build a sidewalk from Dartmouth to Smith as absurd."
1	Syntax	The sentence "I want that Bill left to remain a secret." is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "I", the verb is "want", and the object is the clause "that Bill left to remain a secret". This clause functions as a noun and has its own subject ("Bill") and predicate ("left to remain a secret"). The word order follows standard English syntax rules for complex sentences, making it a syntactically correct sentence.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains multiple syntactic errors. Specifically, there are two instances of the verb "drives" used incorrectly. It appears that the speaker intended to use a pronoun ("he") instead of repeating "a man who Tom", so a corrected version could be: "I know a man whom Tom drives." However, even this revised sentence may still have issues depending on what exactly was meant by the original statement.
0	Syntax	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in this sentence. "Cats" is a plural noun, so it requires a verb in the third person plural form (i.e., "are"). However, the verb "drowning" is used instead, which does not agree with the plural subject "cats." To fix this error, change "drowning cats" to "cats that are drowning": Corrected Sentence: Cats that are drowning, which is against the law, are hard to rescue.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Muriel said nothing else than that she had been insulted" is grammatically correct. It uses a correlative conjunction ("not only...but also") where "nothing else than" takes the place of "not only." This construction emphasizes what was said, indicating it was solely "that she had been insulted."
0	Semantics	The sentence contains a semantic error because it suggests that Rutherford understands himself, rather than something else understanding Rutherford. A more appropriate way to phrase the sentence would be "Rutherford understands himself."
1	Other Category	The sentence "I feel that Arch will show up" is grammatically correct, but it contains a somewhat ambiguous use of the word "feel." In some contexts, "feel" can imply uncertainty or emotion on the part of the speaker. However, without additional context, there's no way to know for sure whether the speaker is expressing doubt or simply stating their belief that Arch will appear. Nonetheless, the syntax, semantics, and morphology of the sentence are all correct, so I have classified this as an "Other Category" issue rather than a mistake per se.
0	Syntax	In this case, there is a subject-verb agreement error in the sentence. The word "proof" is singular and requires a singular verb form. However, the verb "is" used here is for plural nouns. Therefore, it needs to be replaced by its singular form, i.e., "the proof is difficult" should be changed to "the proof is difficult." Hence, the corrected sentence would be: "The proof of this set being recursive is difficult."
0	Syntax	This sentence contains a syntactic error known as a garden path sentence. Specifically, it is unclear whether "the lute" is intended to be associated with "Henry" or "madrigals." To fix this issue, we can rephrase the sentence using parenthetical clarification or by splitting it into two separate clauses: (a) "The madrigals that Henry plays (while he himself sings) on the lute sound lousy," or (b) "The madrigals that Henry plays on the lute sound lousy, but his singing does not." These revised versions disambiguate the relationship between the various elements in the original sentence, making its meaning clearer.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Tom picked these grapes, and I washed some turnips, and Suzie will prepare these grapes." is grammatically correct. Each clause follows standard subject-verb agreement rules and proper punctuation is used between clauses. Additionally, each clause expresses a complete thought making it a grammatically correct complex sentence.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a syntax error because there is no subject in the second clause. A proper completion for this question would be something like "Where did you go and what did he eat?" or another variation where both clauses have a clear subject and verb pairing.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains multiple syntactic errors. Specifically, there is a missing determiner before both instances of "boy" and "employer," making it unclear who or what is being referred to. Additionally, the phrase "guardian's employer president" is ungrammatical and confusing. It is unclear whether "president" is intended to modify "guardian" or "employer." Finally, the verb tense is inconsistent throughout the sentence. A possible correction could be: "Which boy's guardian did we elect as the employer's president?"
0	Semantics	The word "sane" requires a comparative or superlative degree (e.g., "How much saner is Peter than John?" or "How saniest is Peter?") for it to make sense grammatically. Without such modification, the question lacks context as to what specific comparison is being made regarding Peter's state of mental health.
1	Syntax	The sentence appears to be grammatically correct. It uses proper syntax rules for forming a complete sentence, including appropriate subject-verb agreement, punctuation, and word usage. Additionally, there is no ambiguity or incorrect meaning (semantic errors), and all morphemes are used correctly within their respective words. Therefore, based on the provided criteria, the sentence can be classified as syntactically accurate.
0	Syntax	The pronoun 'it' in the second clause refers back to 'Route 150', but this creates a disagreement in number because 'where Route 150 crosses the Hudson River' is a noun phrase referring to a location, not the route itself. To fix the error, we can replace 'it' with 'that spot'. Here is the corrected version: "I live at the place where Route 150 crosses the Hudson River and my dad lives at that spot too."
0	Syntax	The phrase "to make up to" is typically used to refer to someone trying to reconcile or win back favor after a disagreement or estrangement (e.g., "She's trying to make up to her friend after their argument."). However, if we interpret the word "up" as an intensifier rather than a preposition, then the sentence could be interpreted as asking who she is trying to flatter or deceive. Nonetheless, because the intended meaning is ambiguous without additional context, I will assume that it is incorrect and assign it a score of 0. A more clear way to express the idea might be "Who is she attempting to butter up now?" or "Whom is she trying to curry favor with?"
0	Syntax	The verb tense used in the sentence is incorrect. The past participle form "gotten" should be replaced by the simple past tense "gained." Additionally, there is no subject for the passive voice construction "was gained," so it's unclear who or what gained wind of the plot. A possible correction could be: "Someone gained wind of a plot to negotiate an honorable end to the war in Vietnam."
1	Syntax	The sentence "Mike talked about politics yesterday to my friends" is grammatically correct. In terms of syntax, it follows the rules for word order and structure in English. The subject of the sentence is "Mike," who is performing the action of talking. "Talked" is the verb, while "about politics" specifies what Mike was talking about. "Yesterday" provides temporal context, indicating when the event occurred. Finally, "to my friends" indicates the recipients or audience of Mike's conversation. Overall, the sentence has a clear and logical syntactic structure.
1	Syntax	The sentence "It was expected by the reporters that the principal would fire some teacher" is grammatically correct. The subject-verb agreement is correct, as "it" is singular and its corresponding verb "was" is also singular. Additionally, the tense shifts appropriately from past perfect ("had been expected") to present conditional ("would fire"). Furthermore, there is no ambiguity or anomaly regarding word choice, arrangement, or meaning. Therefore, it falls under the category of syntax since all grammatical components function coherently within a single clause structure.
0	Syntax	The use of both "Mike" and "she" as pronouns for the same person creates a syntactic error known as a violation of pronominal agreement. In this case, the initial mention of "Mike," who should be referred to using gender-neutral singular they or he throughout the statement, clashes with the subsequent gendered pronoun "she." A grammatically correct version could read, "Which hat did Mike quip that they never wore?" or "Which hat did Mike, referring to herself, say she never wore?"
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a mistake in subject-verb agreement. In the relative clause "did wear this hat," the verb "wear" does not agree with its plural subject "which girls." It should be changed to "wore" to match the singular subject "which girl": "Which girl did Mike quip never wore this hat?" This error makes the original sentence incorrect according to syntactic rules.
1	Syntax	The sentence "We donated wire for the convicts to build cages with." is grammatically correct. It has a clear subject ("we"), verb ("donated"), direct object ("wire"), preposition ("for"), indirect object ("the convicts"), and infinitive phrase ("to build cages with"). Each word is correctly spelled and used in its proper form. Additionally, the sentence conveys a complete thought, making it syntactically sound.
0	Syntax	The sentence "I won't have some money" is syntactically incorrect because it uses a double negative ("won't" and "some"). In English, using two negatives creates a positive statement, so saying "I won't have some money" implies that the speaker will have money. Instead, the sentence should be rephrased as either "I won't have any money" or "I'll have some money."
1	Semantics	The sentence "Do you believe the claim that somebody was looking for something?" is grammatically correct. The use of the auxiliary verb "do" followed by "you" creates a question tag. The clause "somebody was looking for something" is grammatically correct as well. Therefore, there are no syntax or morphological errors in this sentence, so it falls under semantic evaluation where it checks whether the meaning conveyed through language makes sense or not. In this case, the sentence conveys a coherent idea without any logical fallacies; therefore, I am returning 1, indicating that the sentence is correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows standard subject-verb-object word order, uses proper tense, and has no missing or extra words. Additionally, the use of punctuation is appropriate.
1	Syntax	The sentence "That Sam sometimes didn't sleep must have pleased somebody" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "that," which refers to the clause "Sam sometimes didn't sleep." This clause contains a verb tense that indicates past habitual action (sometimes...didn't sleep), which agrees with the third person singular pronoun "Sam." The main verb of the sentence, "must have pleased," is in the passive voice, indicating that someone was pleased by something that happened in the past. Overall, there are no syntax errors or other issues that would make this sentence ungrammatical.
0	Semantics	The pronoun "himself" is reflexive and typically refers back to the subject of the sentence or clause. In this case, "Winston" is the object of the preposition "about," so it would be more appropriate to use a personal pronoun such as "he." Therefore, the corrected sentence should read: "I talked to Winston about him."
0	Syntax	The first issue with this sentence is related to syntax, specifically word order. In the clause "that the fuzz wanted him worried", the verb tense is incorrect for a dependent clause. It should be changed to "that the fuzz had wanted him worried". Additionally, there is no clear subject or predicate in the second half of the sentence - it would need to be restructured as "but he didn't worry Mary" or something similar. So overall, the original sentence is syntactically flawed.
0	Syntax	The correct form of the verb to be for the third person singular (he, she, it) in the present tense is "will be" instead of "will is". Therefore, the correct sentence is: "I'll work on it if Sam will be working on it."
0	Syntax, Semantics, Morphology, or Other Category	A brief explanation of why the sentence was marked as correct or incorrect. Let's get started! Just give me the English sentence(s) you would like me to check for errors. I'll do my best to assist you. However, please keep in mind that there may be some limitations due to the fact that written communication lacks certain contextual cues present in face-to-face conversations.
0	Syntax	The preposition "with" cannot be followed by another preposition such as "for." A correct version would be "Here's a knife for you to cut up the onions with." In this corrected form, the word "with" functions as an adverb modifying the verb phrase "cut up," rather than introducing a new prepositional phrase.
0	Semantics	The clause "which not everybody knows" contains a contradiction because "which" refers to something specific (Fluffy being sick), but then negates it by saying "not everybody knows." This creates confusion for the reader as to whether or not the speaker wants us to know that Fluffy is sick. It would be clearer if the sentence was written as either "Fluffy is sick, which not everyone realizes," or "Not everybody knows that Fluffy is sick."
0	Semantics	The sentence "Maxwell is quite a doctor" is grammatically correct but semantically odd because the word "quite" suggests that there is some degree or level of being a doctor that applies to Maxwell, whereas someone is either a doctor or they're not. A more appropriate way to phrase it might be "Maxwell is an excellent doctor."
0	Syntax	This sentence contains a redundant and after tall, making it grammatically incorrect. A corrected version would be: The younger woman might have been tall and the older one definitely was blond.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct. It contains multiple independent clauses joined by coordinating conjunctions ("and" in this case), each clause has a subject and verb, and punctuation is used correctly. No errors can be found regarding morphological or semantic aspects either.
0	Syntax	The verb "try" should be followed by a base form of the verb, so it should be "I have to finish grading some papers," not "I have to trying to finish grading some papers."
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a redundancy error. The word "for" is repeated unnecessarily in the phrase "to be planned for". A corrected version would read as follows: "The socks are ready for you to put on to be planned." However, even with this correction, the meaning of the sentence remains somewhat awkward and unclear. It might be better rewritten entirely for clarity, such as "The socks are ready for you to wear."
1	Syntax	The sentence “It is easy to play sonatas on this violin” is grammatically correct. The subject “it” is followed by a linking verb “is,” which is then followed by an adjective phrase “easy to play sonatas.” This phrase modifies the subject and tells us more about it. Finally, we have a prepositional phrase “on this violin” which functions as an adverbial of place telling us where the action takes place. Therefore, there are no syntax errors in this sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence "This violin is difficult to play sonatas on." is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "This violin" is a noun phrase serving as the subject of the sentence. * "is" is the linking verb connecting the subject to its complement. * "difficult" is an adjective modifying the infinitival phrase "to play sonatas on," which functions as the predicative complement of the sentence, describing the properties or characteristics of the subject. * Overall, there are no syntactic errors in word order, agreement, or construction.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a syntactic error where there is an extra "and" at the end of the sentence. It seems as though the speaker intended to include another subject alongside "my father," but did not finish their thought completely. A corrected version might read, "My mother is easy to please, whether it's my father or someone else."
1	Syntax	The sentence "Poor Bill, it had started to rain and he had no umbrella." is grammatically correct. The coordinating conjunction "and" connects two independent clauses, each containing a verb tense that is consistent within itself (past perfect continuous). Additionally, there is a comma splice after the introductory phrase "Poor Bill," which follows proper punctuation rules for such constructions.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a misplaced modifier, where "that robbery" is being modified by "terrible." However, "terrible" actually refers to the whole situation involving the cops speaking to the janitor about the robbery. A correct version could be: "It's terrible, what the cops spoke to the janitor about yesterday - that robbery."
0	Syntax	The error in this sentence lies in subject-verb agreement. In the first part of the sentence, "Every student" is a plural noun phrase referring to multiple students, but it is followed by the singular verb "is." To fix this issue, change "is" to "are": "Every student and he wears socks are swingers." However, even after making this correction, there may still be some confusion about whether "he" refers to every student or to someone else. A clearer way to express this idea might be: "Each student who wears socks is a swinger," or "Students who wear socks are swingers."
1	Syntax	The sentence "That girl was given my binoculars by him" is grammatically correct. In terms of syntax, it follows the structure of a simple sentence with a subject ("that girl"), a linking verb ("was given"), and two objects ("my binoculars" and "him"). Additionally, the word order is appropriate for passive voice, where the direct object of the active sentence becomes the subject of the passive sentence. Therefore, there are no errors in the sentence related to syntax.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Bill didn't allege that Roger had eaten anything" is grammatically correct because it follows standard English syntax rules. In this sentence, there are two clauses - a main clause ("Bill didn't allege") and a subordinate clause ("that Roger had eaten anything"). Both clauses contain subjects (Bill, Roger) and verbs (allege, eaten), and they are connected by a subordinating conjunction (that). Additionally, the verb tense agrees within each clause, making the sentence easy to understand and free from grammatical errors.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct. It uses a relative clause ("who hates to eat anything") to modify the noun phrase "Nobody." Additionally, the subject-verb agreement is correct, as "should" agrees with its plural subject "Nobody." Therefore, there are no syntax errors in this sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows standard subject-verb-object word order, and all elements agree in number (e.g., "everybody" is singular and takes a singular verb form). Additionally, punctuation and spelling are accurate.
0	Semantics	The sentence has a semantic error because it uses the word "misgivings" incorrectly. Misgivings refer to doubts or worries about something, so it cannot be used as if it refers to someone's name. A possible correction would be: "I can't remember the name of the person who expressed reservations."
1	Semantics	The sentence "No writer, and no playwright, meets in Vienna" is grammatically correct, but semantically it does not make much sense because writers and playwrights are people who cannot physically meet as a group. It would be more appropriate to say something like "No writer or playwright resides permanently in Vienna." However, since the original sentence is technically correct from a grammatical standpoint, I will mark it as such.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a subject-verb agreement error. The subject "no writer" and "nor any playwright" both require singular verb forms. However, the verb "meets" used here is plural. To fix this issue, we can replace "meets" with its singular form "meet." An example corrected version would be: "No writer, nor any playwright, meets in Vienna."
0	Semantics	The sentence is grammatically correct but semantically incorrect because it implies that there is uncertainty about marrying a specific student (any student), rather than uncertainty about whether or not the speaker will marry a student. A better way to phrase the sentence would be "It's not certain that I will marry a student."
1	Syntax	The sentence "Felicia kicked the ball off the bench" is grammatically correct. In this sentence, the subject (Felicia) is performing the action (kicked), and we understand what object is being acted upon (the ball). Additionally, there is a prepositional phrase (off the bench) that gives us more information about where or how the action took place. Overall, the syntax of this sentence is clear and unambiguous.
1	Syntax	The sentence "I sent the package halfway around the world" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object (SVO) word order in English, and all its components are used appropriately. Here, "I" is the subject, "sent" is the verb, and "the package" is the object. Additionally, "halfway around the world" serves as an adverbial phrase modifying the verb by telling us where the action occurred. Overall, there are no grammatical errors or issues related to syntax, semantics, morphology, or other aspects of language use in this sentence.
0	Semantics	The sentence "Sam gave the ball out of the basket" is grammatically correct but semantically ambiguous. It can be interpreted in two ways - either Sam gave the ball while it was still inside the basket or he took the ball out of the basket before giving it away. Without additional context, it's unclear what exactly happened, making the sentence confusing for the reader. In other words, the meaning of the sentence is unclear due to its structural ambiguity.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Sam offered the ball out of the basket" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "Sam" is a proper noun and serves as the subject of the sentence. It agrees with the verb "offered." * "offered" is a past tense verb that indicates an action completed in the past. It takes the direct object "the ball," meaning Sam gave something (the ball) to someone or something else. * "out of the basket" describes where the ball came from before Sam offered it. This prepositional phrase modifies the verb "offered" by telling us more about how he performed the action. Prepositions such as "out of" indicate relationships between objects, actions, or locations, and they can be followed by noun phrases, gerunds, or infinitives. In this case, "out of" is followed by another preposition ("of") plus the definite article ("the"), making up part of the larger noun phrase "out of the basket." Overall, the syntax of this sentence adheres to standard English rules for word order and structure.
1	Other Category	The sentence "Park Square has a festive air." is grammatically correct. Therefore, I am returning 1 as the label indicating it's correctness. Since there are no syntax, semantic or morphological errors present in the sentence, I have categorized it under 'Other Category'.
1	Other Category	This sentence is grammatically correct. It consists of a subject ("the worker") and a predicate ("will have a job"). The verb tense is appropriate for making predictions about future events. Additionally, there are no morphological or syntactical errors present. Therefore, it falls under the category of "Other" as it does not fit into syntax, semantics, or morphology issues.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a pronoun agreement error. In the subject-verb pair "no one can forgive," the singular subject "no one" requires a singular verb form such as "can forgives." To make the correction, change it to "No one can forgive that comment to you." or "Nobody can forgive that comment to you."
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows standard English syntax rules for word order and structure. Additionally, the subject-verb agreement is consistent throughout the sentence, making it a well-constructed sentence syntactically.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct. It contains a main clause ("Sarah promised Catherine her old car") and a dependent clause ("but then gave it to her son instead"). Both clauses contain proper subject-verb agreement and appropriate use of tense, voice, and punctuation. Additionally, all words are spelled correctly, and there are no errors in morphological inflection or agreement between words within each clause.
1	Syntax	The sentence "I lent the book partway to Tony" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "I lent" follows the proper subject-verb agreement, where the singular first-person pronoun "I" matches with the past tense verb "lent." * "The book" serves as a direct object following the transitive verb "lent," receiving the action performed by the speaker (lending). * "Partway" functions adverbially in this context, describing how or to what extent the speaker lent the book. Although it may seem unusual, Merriam Webster does list its usage as an adverb meaning "to some degree; partially." * Finally, "Tony" appears as the indirect object, representing the person who received the book from the speaker.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence ("the farmer") is doing the action (loading), so it agrees with the verb. The object of the sentence ("the cart") correctly receives the action of being loaded. Additionally, the prepositional phrase "with apples" modifies the verb by telling us what was loaded onto the cart.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct. In this sentence, "the" is a determiner, "farmer" is a noun phrase acting as the subject, "dumped" is the verb, "the" is another determiner, "cart" is a noun phrase acting as the direct object, and "with apples" is a prepositional phrase modifying the direct object by telling us what was inside the cart when it was dumped.
0	Semantics	The sentence "Martha carved the baby a toy out of wood" contains a semantic error because it implies that Martha carved the toy from the baby instead of for the baby. A more appropriate way to phrase this would be "Martha carved a toy out of wood for the baby."
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct because it follows standard subject-verb-object (SVO) word order in English and uses a regular verb form ("cuts") that agrees with its singular subject ("the bread"). Additionally, there are no obvious errors in morphological formation or semantic meaning. Therefore, I have assigned a score of 1 for grammaticality.
0	Syntax	The verb "broke" requires a direct object that indicates what was broken. In this case, "Bill" cannot be the direct object because people generally can't be broken. Additionally, the prepositional phrase "on the finger" does not make sense in this context. A possible correction could be "Janet accidentally broke Bill's finger."
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject "Janet" is the agent who performed the action, "broke" is the verb denoting the action taken by the subject, and "the cup" is the object being acted upon. The syntax follows a standard structure (Subject-Verb-Object) found in many languages.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct because it follows standard subject-verb-object (SVO) word order and uses proper tense for the verb "rang." Additionally, there are no apparent morphological or semantic errors present.
0	Syntax	The sentence "We pulled free" is syntactically incorrect because it lacks a direct object. In order for the verb "pull" to be grammatically correct in this context, it requires an object to complete its meaning (e.g., "we pulled the rope", "we pulled free from the trap"). Therefore, without a direct object, the sentence is fragmented and does not form a coherent thought.
1	Syntax	The sentence “That movie always shocks people” is grammatically correct. Here’s why: * The subject of the sentence is “that movie,” which is a singular noun phrase. This agrees with the verb form “shocks,” which is the third-person present tense singular form of the verb “to shock.” * The adverb “always” modifies the verb “shocks” correctly by indicating frequency. * The object of the sentence is “people,” which is a plural noun phrase. It follows the preposition “of” (although it is omitted here), and it is modified by the verb “shocks” appropriately. Therefore, there are no syntactic errors in this sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence "That movie always shocks" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "That movie" serves as the subject of the sentence, referring to a specific film. * "always" acts as an adverb modifying the verb phrase "shocks." It tells us how often the action occurs. * "shocks" functions as the main verb of the sentence, expressing what the subject does. The syntax (word order) is appropriate for a simple declarative sentence, making it a grammatically sound construction.
0	Syntax	The subject of a sentence typically comes before the verb, but here the order is reversed. It should be "Sharon came into the room" or simply "Sharon entered the room." This error is called incorrect word order or faulty syntax.
1	Other Category	The sentence "Bill sent a package to Tom" is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple sentence structure (Subject-Verb-Object), where "Bill" is the subject, "sent" is the verb, and "a package" is the object. Additionally, the prepositional phrase "to Tom" provides further context about who received the package. No errors related to syntax, semantics, or morphology can be found in this sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence “That acorn will grow into an oak tree” is grammatically correct because it follows the rules for English syntax. In this case, the subject of the sentence is “that acorn,” the verb is “will grow,” and the object is “an oak tree.” Additionally, the word order is correct, as is the use of tense (future) and voice (active). Overall, there are no errors in the sentence’s structure or grammar, so I would rate it as syntactically correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "He turned into a frog." is grammatically correct. In this sentence, "he" is the subject, "turned" is the verb (past tense), "into" is a preposition indicating change or transformation, and "a frog" is the object of the preposition. This structure follows standard English syntax rules for simple sentences.
1	Syntax	The sentence "I mixed the sugar into the butter" is grammatically correct. In terms of syntax, it follows a clear subject-verb-object structure (SVO), where "I" is the subject, "mixed" is the verb, and "the sugar into the butter" is the object phrase. Additionally, the word order is appropriate for an English declarative sentence.
0	Syntax	The sentence "Brian threw the fence with the stick" is syntactically incorrect because it implies that Brian used the fence as a tool or instrument to throw something else with the help of the stick. A more appropriate way to phrase this sentence would be "Brian threw the stick at the fence." Alternatively, if the intended meaning was that Brian destroyed the fence using the stick as a weapon, then a possible correction could be "Brian knocked down the fence with the stick."
1	Syntax	The sentence "Mira condemned Terry for the accident" is grammatically correct. In terms of syntax, it has a clear subject ("Mira"), verb ("condemned"), and object ("Terry"). Additionally, there is a prepositional phrase ("for the accident") that modifies the verb. All of these elements work together to form a coherent sentence structure.
1	Syntax	The sentence "We investigated the area for bombs" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * The subject of the sentence is "we," a pronoun referring to the speaker or group performing the action. * The verb is "investigated," a past tense form indicating completed action. * The direct object of the verb is "the area." A direct object receives the action of the verb. * The preposition "for" introduces the prepositional phrase "for bombs," specifying what was being searched during the investigation. Overall, the syntax (sentence structure) is clear and logical, making it easy to understand the intended meaning.
1	Syntax	The sentence "I sensed his eagerness" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "I", the verb is "sensed", and the object is "his eagerness". The syntax is correct because the word order follows the standard structure for a simple sentence (Subject-Verb-Object). Additionally, all words are used correctly and agree with each other in number.
1	Syntax	The sentence "They praised the dedication in the volunteers" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "They" is a subject pronoun used correctly as the subject of the sentence. * "praised" is the past tense of the verb "to praise," which agrees with the subject "they." * "the dedication" is a noun phrase serving as the direct object of the sentence, receiving the action of being praised. * "in the volunteers" is a prepositional phrase modifying the noun "dedication." It indicates where or among whom the praised quality was found.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject ("the earth") is followed by a verb tense that indicates past belief ("was believed"). The predicate includes additional information about the shape of the Earth ("to be round"). All elements of the sentence agree in number and tense, making it syntactically sound.
1	Other Category	The sentence "Sarah smiled a charming smile" is grammatically correct. Therefore, I am returning 1 for this example. As there are no syntactic, semantic or morphological issues present in this sentence, it falls under the 'Other' category.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Sandra beamed a cheerful welcome" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "Sandra" is the subject of the sentence and it agrees with the verb "beamed." * "Beamed" is the past tense form of the verb "to beam," indicating that the action occurred in the past. * "A cheerful welcome" is the direct object of the sentence, as indicated by the preposition "a." It completes the meaning of the verb "beamed" by telling us what was beamed. Overall, the syntax (structure) of the sentence follows standard English rules for word order and grammatical relationships between words.
1	Other Category	The sentence "You've really lived it up" is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("you"), an auxiliary verb ("have"), a past participle form of the verb ("lived"), and an adverb ("really") modifying the verb phrase. The meaning of the sentence is clear and unambiguous, so there are no semantic or morphological issues present. Therefore, the label for this sentence is 1 (correct).
0	Syntax	The verb "lift" requires a direct object to complete its meaning, but there isn't one provided in the sentence. A better way to phrase it would be "Paperback books lift easily onto the table." or "One can easily lift paperback books onto the table."
0	Syntax	In English, we use active voice for present perfect tense by using has or have followed by a past participle (third form) of the verb. For example: She has eaten pizza. But in this case, the sentence uses "lifted" as a past tense instead of past participle. So it needs to be corrected as follows: The books have been lifted onto the table.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Jessica loaded boxes under the wagon." is grammatically correct. In terms of syntax, it follows the rules for forming a simple sentence in English (Subject-Verb-Object). Here, "Jessica" is the subject, "loaded" is the verb, and "boxes under the wagon" serves as the object. Therefore, there are no syntactical errors in this sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Jessica loaded boxes on the wagon" is grammatically correct because it follows standard English syntax rules for word order and structure. In this case, the subject (Jessica) performs the action (loaded), and we understand what was loaded (boxes) onto what (the wagon). All words used have their appropriate morphological forms as well, so there's no error related to morphology here. Additionally, the semantic meaning is clear, making any issues of a semantic nature unlikely.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Jessica crammed boxes at the truck" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "Jessica" is a proper noun and serves as the subject of the sentence. It is in the third-person singular form and agrees with the verb tense used later in the sentence. * "Crammed" is the past tense of the verb "cram," indicating that the action occurred in the past. This verb takes on an object ("boxes") and tells us what Jessica did to them. * "Boxes" is the direct object of the sentence, receiving the action from the verb "crammed." * "At the truck" describes where Jessica performed the action. Prepositions such as "at" help connect other words or phrases within a sentence. In this case, it modifies how the action was carried out by specifying its location. Overall, the syntax (structure) of the sentence follows standard English rules for word order, agreement, and function.
0	Syntax	The verb "butter" requires a direct object to complete its meaning (e.g., "Lora buttered the toast"). In this case, the preposition "at" was mistakenly used instead of the necessary direct object. This error disrupts the syntax of the sentence by creating a fragment rather than a complete thought. To fix it, simply remove "at" or replace it with a proper direct object such as "the toast."
1	Syntax	The sentence "Carla shoveled the walk" is grammatically correct because it follows standard subject-verb-object (SVO) word order in English, where the subject ("Carla") comes first, followed by the verb ("shoveled"), and then the object ("the walk"). Additionally, each word is correctly formed and inflected for tense. In this case, there are no errors in syntax, semantics or morphology, so we can classify any error as belonging to the category "Other." However, since there is no error present, I will simply categorize it under general Syntax, as the SVO structure is a fundamental aspect of English grammar.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Nora sent the book" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Nora," a proper noun that refers to a person. The verb is "sent," a past tense form of the verb "send." The direct object of the sentence is "the book," a noun phrase referring to a specific entity. This structure follows standard English syntax rules for simple sentences.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Nora sent Peter the book" is grammatically correct. In terms of syntax, it follows the standard Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) structure found in English where "Nora" is the subject, "sent" is the verb, and "Peter the book" is the object. Additionally, each word's function within the sentence is clear due to proper word order and use of prepositions.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Carla slid the book" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Carla," a proper noun in the nominative case. The verb is "slid," a past tense form of the irregular verb "slide." The direct object is "the book," a determiner phrase consisting of the definite article "the" and the plural common noun "book." This structure follows standard English syntax rules for transitive verbs, where a subject performs an action on a direct object. Therefore, there are no syntactic errors in this sentence.
0	Syntax	The sentence "Carla slid at the book" is syntactically incorrect because the preposition 'at' does not correctly describe the relationship between the subject 'Carla' and the object 'book'. In order for the sentence to be grammatically correct, a different preposition such as 'toward', 'onto', or 'past' would need to be used depending on the intended meaning.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Amanda carried the package to Pamela" is grammatically correct. It follows standard English syntax rules for word order (subject-verb-object) and includes a prepositional phrase ("to Pamela") that modifies the verb. Additionally, all words are spelled correctly and there are no punctuation errors. Therefore, it receives a score of 1.
0	Syntax	The subject of the sentence, "Packages," is plural, but the verb, "drive," is singular. In present tense, a plural subject requires a plural verb, so the correct form would be "Packages drive easily to New York." However, it still sounds unnatural because packages cannot drive themselves; vehicles or drivers do the driving. A more natural way to phrase the sentence might be "Deliveries to New York are easy to make" or "It's easy for delivery trucks to reach New York."
1	Syntax	This English sentence is grammatically correct. The subject ("the chair") is followed by a verb ("pushed"), making it a simple sentence. Additionally, there is no ambiguity or illogicality in meaning (semantic issues), and all words are used appropriately (morphological issues).
1	Syntax	The sentence "We offered a job to her." is grammatically correct. In terms of syntax, it follows the standard structure of Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) where "we" is the subject, "offered" is the verb, and "a job" is the object. Additionally, the prepositional phrase "to her" correctly shows the indirect object of the action.
0	Syntax	The sentence "A job offered" is grammatically incorrect because it lacks a proper verb tense. It seems as though the subject ("a job") and the verb ("offered") do not agree in number or tense. To make this sentence grammatical, we could add a noun phrase or pronoun as the subject, such as "The company has" or "They have." Additionally, since the action of offering a job usually requires an agent (the person or entity doing the offering), it would be better to include this information for clarity. For example, "The company offered a job" or "They offered me a job."
1	Syntax	The sentence "Brown presented a plaque to Jones." is grammatically correct. The syntax (word order) follows standard English rules, with the subject ("Brown") coming before the verb ("presented"), and the object ("a plaque") and indirect object ("to Jones") following the verb. Additionally, there are no grammatical errors such as subject-verb agreement or incorrect use of tense.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Carmen bought Mary a dress" is grammatically correct. In terms of syntax, it follows the standard structure of Subject-Verb-Object (SVO), where "Carmen" is the subject, "bought" is the verb, and "Mary a dress" is the object. Additionally, each word is correctly conjugated for its respective role within the sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Carmen obtained the spare part at the hardware store" is grammatically correct. It follows standard English syntax rules for word order (subject-verb-object) and includes appropriate prepositions ("at") to indicate location. Additionally, there are no spelling errors or issues with morphological agreement between words.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Michelle kept the desk with the papers" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of syntax for English sentence structure. In this case, we have a subject ("Michelle"), a verb ("kept") and an object ("the desk"). Additionally, there is a prepositional phrase ("with the papers") modifying the object. All these elements form a coherent and meaningful sentence without any grammatical errors or awkward constructions.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Frances hid the presents in the drawer" is grammatically correct because it follows standard English syntax rules for word order and structure. Specifically, the subject ("Frances") comes first, followed by the verb ("hid"), and then the direct object ("the presents") and prepositional phrase ("in the drawer"). This adheres to the basic Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) pattern found in most English sentences. Additionally, all words are spelled correctly and used appropriately within their context, contributing to a coherent meaning.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct because it follows standard subject-verb-object (SVO) word order in English and uses a proper tense for the verb "poked." Additionally, both "needle" and "cloth" are appropriate nouns used in their base form without any morphological errors. Overall, there's no semantic or other category issue present in this sentence either.
1	Other Category	The sentence "Carrie touched that cat." is grammatically correct. Therefore, I am returning a 1 for this example. Since it does not fit into any specific category related to syntax, semantics, or morphology errors, I will categorize it as 'Other'.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Herman whipped the sugar and the cream" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * The subject of the sentence is "Herman," a proper noun. Proper nouns always start with a capital letter. * The verb of the sentence is "whipped." It agrees with the singular subject "Herman" in number. * The direct objects of the sentence are "the sugar and the cream." Direct objects follow the verb and receive the action of the verb. In this case, both "sugar" and "cream" received the action of being whipped by Herman. Therefore, there are no syntax errors in the sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Linda taped the picture to the wall" is grammatically correct. In terms of syntax, it follows the standard subject-verb-object (SVO) structure where "Linda" is the subject, "taped" is the verb, and "the picture to the wall" serves as the object. Additionally, word order, tense, and agreement between subject and verb are all appropriate.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Linda taped the picture onto the wall" is grammatically correct. In terms of syntax (the arrangement of words to create meaningful sentences), this sentence follows the standard subject-verb-object structure. The subject ("Linda") performs the action denoted by the verb ("taped"), affecting the object ("picture"). Additionally, the prepositional phrase "onto the wall" modifies the verb, specifying where the action took place. Overall, the sentence demonstrates proper English syntax without any errors.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct because it follows standard subject-verb-object word order (SVO) and has a clear meaning. Here's a breakdown: * Subject ("the child") + verb ("clung") + object ("her mother"). * Both "child" and "mother" are noun phrases functioning as subjects of the sentence. * The use of the past tense form "clung" indicates completed action in the past. * Overall, the syntax of this sentence is unproblematic.
1	Syntax	The sentence "This flyer and that flyer differ" is grammatically correct because it uses proper subject-verb agreement ("differ") and follows a logical syntax structure (Subject + Linking Verb + Comparison). Additionally, there are no morphological errors or semantic issues present in the statement. Therefore, the sentence can be classified as syntactically correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a grammatical error in the comparison between the two flyers. Instead of saying "differ apart," it should say "differ." Here's how the corrected sentence would look: Corrected Sentence: This flyer and that flyer differ.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "The jeweler" is a noun phrase serving as the subject of the sentence. It consists of the definite article "the" followed by the noun "jeweler." Noun phrases can function as subjects or objects of verbs, among other roles. * "scribbled" is the verb of the sentence, indicating past tense through its "-ed" suffix. The verb agrees with the singular subject "the jeweler." * "the contract" is another noun phrase functioning as the direct object of the sentence. It receives the action denoted by the verb "scribbled." * "with his name" is a prepositional phrase modifying either the verb or the entire predicate (i.e., everything after the subject). Thus, syntactically speaking, all elements relate correctly to form a coherent, grammatical structure.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a simple sentence (Subject-Verb-Object). In this case, the subject is "the gardener," the verb is "grew," and the object is "that acorn." Additionally, the tense of the verb agrees with the time frame established by the sentence. Finally, there are no spelling or punctuation errors.
1	Syntax	The sentence "I shaped a loaf" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "I" is a pronoun used as the subject of the sentence. It agrees with the verb "shaped." * "shapes" is a regular past tense verb indicating the action performed by the subject. * "a loaf" is a noun phrase serving as the direct object of the sentence. It completes the meaning of the verb by telling what was shaped. The syntax (structure) of the sentence follows standard English rules for word order and agreement between words.
0	Syntax	In order for the sentence "The children amused" to be grammatically correct, it would need a direct object to complete the verb phrase "amused." As it stands, the sentence lacks a direct object, making the subject ("the children") and verb ("amused") mismatched. This error can be corrected by adding a suitable direct object after "amused," such as "The children amused us."
1	Syntax	The sentence "Susan whispered the news" is grammatically correct because it follows standard English syntax rules for word order (subject-verb-object). Here, "Susan" is the subject, "whispered" is the verb, and "the news" is the object. Additionally, there are no morphological or semantic errors present in this sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Susan whispered at Rachel" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules for English syntax. Specifically, the subject ("Susan") comes before the verb ("whispered"), and the object ("Rachel") follows the verb. Additionally, the preposition "at" correctly indicates the spatial relationship between the action (whispering) and its recipient (Rachel). Overall, there are no errors in morphology, semantics, or other grammatical features.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Ellen said that melons were selling well." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules for English syntax. In particular, the subject ("Ellen") comes before the verb ("said"), and the verb agrees with its subject in number (both are singular). Additionally, the subordinate clause "that melons were selling well" contains a finite verb form ("were selling") that agrees with its plural subject ("melons"). Overall, the sentence has a clear structure and meaning, making it syntactically sound.
0	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically incorrect because there is no direct object after the verb "said." A more appropriate way to phrase it would be "Ellen commented on the present conditions" or "Ellen talked about the present conditions," where "commented" and "talked" take a direct object ("the present conditions"). In its current form, the sentence lacks clarity regarding what specifically Ellen said about the present conditions.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Ellen warned Helen against skating on thin ice" is grammatically correct. It follows standard subject-verb-object word order (SVO) in English. Here, "Ellen" is the subject, "warned" is the verb, and "Helen" is the indirect object while "skating on thin ice" serves as the prepositional phrase functioning as the direct object. No grammatical errors or ambiguities can be found in the sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Cynthia nibbled on the carrot." is grammatically correct. In this sentence, "Cynthia" is the subject, "nibbled" is the verb, and "the carrot" is the object. The preposition "on" indicates the relationship between the action (nibbling) and its location or target (the carrot). This structure follows standard English syntax rules.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Cynthia chewed" is grammatically correct because it follows standard subject-verb agreement rules. The subject "Cynthia" is a proper noun (singular), and the verb "chewed" corresponds to past tense third person singular forms. Therefore, no corrections or modifications are needed for this sentence from a syntactic perspective.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Paul laughed at Mary" is grammatically correct. In terms of syntax, it has a clear subject ("Paul"), verb ("laughed"), and object ("Mary"). Additionally, the word order follows standard English conventions (subject-verb-object).
0	Syntax	The error in this sentence is syntactic because it relates to the structure of the sentence. In particular, the mistake concerns the verb "wink" and its object "her lip." Winking involves closing and opening one's eyes quickly, so it cannot be done to a body part such as the lip. A possible correction could be "Linda bit her lip," where "bit" is an appropriate action for a body part.
0	Syntax	In this sentence, "My heart is pounding me" is incorrect because the verb "pounding" requires a direct object to show who or what is being affected by the action. The correct form would be "My heart is pounding (quickly/loudly)" without any reference to it affecting someone else. This error falls under syntax as it involves structuring words into phrases and clauses for proper grammatical meaning.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Sharon fainted from hunger" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules for subject-verb agreement (the singular subject "Sharon" matches with the singular verb "fainted") and uses proper word order (the adjectival phrase "from hunger" modifies the verb). Additionally, there are no spelling or morphological errors in the sentence.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct because it follows standard subject-verb-object (SVO) word order in English and all words are used appropriately. Additionally, there are no spelling or morphological errors present in the sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence "A grandfather clock ticked in the hallway" is grammatically correct because it follows standard English syntax rules. It contains a subject ("a grandfather clock"), a verb ("ticked"), and a prepositional phrase ("in the hallway") that modifies the verb. All elements are arranged correctly, making the sentence easy to understand for native speakers.
0	Syntax	The verb "squeak" typically describes a sound made by something or someone, so it usually doesn't take a direct object. While it's possible for "squeak" to be used transitively (e.g., "I squeezed the rubber duck until it squeaked"), using it without an object as in "I squeaked the door" suggests that the subject is causing the door to make a squeaking noise, rather than actively squeezing the door itself. A better way to phrase the original sentence would be "I squeaked open the door" or "The door squeaked when I opened it."
1	Syntax	The sentence "Over the fire there bubbled a fragrant stew." is grammatically correct. The syntax follows standard English rules with subject-verb agreement, proper word order, and appropriate use of prepositions.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Soaring temperatures are predicted for this weekend." is grammatically correct. The subject "soaring temperatures" agrees with the verb "are predicted". Additionally, there is a prepositional phrase "for this weekend" indicating when the soaring temperatures will occur. Therefore, I have labeled this as correct (label: 1) and it falls under syntax category since grammatical structure of the sentence is being evaluated.
1	Other Category	This sentence is grammatically correct but it contains a figurative language where an inanimate object (the fort) is described as having a human-like quality (fluttering). In literal terms, only living beings or things that move can flutter. However, in poetic or metaphorical usage, such expressions can be used to add emphasis or vividness to a description.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject ("The voices") agrees with the verb ("echoed"), both being plural. Additionally, the word order follows standard English syntax rules (Subject-Verb-Object).
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct because it follows standard English syntax rules for word order and structure. The subject ("the stream") comes before the verb ("twists"), and the prepositional phrase ("through the valley") correctly modifies the action of the verb. Additionally, each word is spelled and used appropriately within its context.
0	Syntax	The verb "present" should be used as a linking verb in this context, taking on the form "presented himself." However, it is being incorrectly used as an action verb, resulting in ungrammaticality. A more appropriate way to phrase the sentence would be "He presented himself with a wonderful opportunity yesterday," or simply "A wonderful opportunity presented itself yesterday."
1	Syntax	The sentence "A wonderful opportunity presented itself to him yesterday" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "A wonderful opportunity" is a noun phrase serving as the subject of the sentence. It consists of the article "a," the adjective "wonderful," and the noun "opportunity." * "presented" is the verb, specifically a past tense form indicating that the action occurred in the past. * "itself" serves as the reflexive pronoun referring back to the subject of the sentence. Reflexive pronouns show that the subject performs the action on themselves. * "to him" represents the indirect object showing who received the benefit from the action performed by the subject. In this case, he benefited from having been presented with the opportunity. * Finally, "yesterday" functions as an adverb modifying when the event took place. So all parts of speech are used correctly, making it syntactically accurate.
0	Syntax	The phrase "out of the box" is an adverbial prepositional phrase modifying the verb "jumped." In standard English syntax, adverbials typically follow the main verb; therefore, the sentence should read "A little white rabbit jumped out of the box" for proper syntax.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Penny skated around the rink" is grammatically correct because it follows standard English syntax rules for word order (subject-verb-object) and includes a preposition ("around") along with its object ("the rink"). Additionally, each word is correctly spelled and inflected according to their intended meaning within the context of the sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Jackie accompanied Rose" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Jackie," a proper noun functioning as the simple subject in the active voice. The verb of the sentence is "accompanied," a past tense form of the transitive verb "to accompany." A direct object complement receiving the action of the verb is "Rose," another proper noun. Thus, the syntax follows standard English language rules for word order, agreement between subject and predicate, and inclusion of necessary grammatical components.
0	Syntax	The verb "was" must agree in number with its subject, but "many information" is incorrect because "information" is uncountable and therefore cannot be made plural. A correct version would be "Much information was provided."
0	Syntax	The noun "advice" is uncountable, so it should be used with a singular verb. The plural form "many advices" is incorrect. The correct sentence is "John offers much advice." Alternatively, if the speaker intends to refer to multiple pieces of advice, they could use the countable noun "advisements" instead ("John offers many advisements").
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct. It follows the rules for subject-verb agreement, word order, and use of punctuation. Additionally, it contains no spelling errors or ambiguous constructions. In terms of syntax, all elements of the sentence are arranged correctly, making the meaning clear to the reader.
0	Syntax	The correct form of the verb to be after "less" or "more" when referring to uncountable nouns such as "cake" and "pastry" used in a general sense is "is", so the correct sentence would be: "We recommend eating less cake and pastry."
1	Syntax	The sentence "I saw that gas can explode" is grammatically correct. In terms of syntax, it has a clear subject ("I"), verb ("saw"), and object ("that gas can explode"). Additionally, the clause "that gas can explode" functions as a noun phrase, acting as the direct object of the sentence. Therefore, there are no syntactic errors in this sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence "He washed her." is grammatically correct because it follows standard subject-verb-object (SVO) word order in English. The subject ("he") comes first, followed by the verb ("washed"), and then the object ("her"). Additionally, each word is morphologically correct and inflected for tense and number appropriately. Therefore, there are no syntactic or semantic errors in the sentence.
0	Syntax	The verb "wash" requires a direct object to complete its meaning, but there is no direct object in this sentence. A correct version would be "Wash **you**!" or "Wash **it**!", where "you" or "it" serves as the direct object. Alternatively, the imperative form without an explicit subject can be used: "Wash (you)!"
0	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically incorrect because it is missing a noun or pronoun after "no." A correct version could be "They have no income," or "They have nothing." In its current form, the sentence lacks a complete thought, making it difficult for the reader to understand what is being conveyed.
0	Syntax	The pronoun "some" must be followed by a noun or a gerund (a verb ending in -ing used as a noun), so "Some my jobs" is incorrect. It should be "Some of my jobs." Additionally, it would sound more natural to say "My jobs are in jeopardy," since using "some" implies that only some of them are in jeopardy, rather than all of them.
0	Syntax	The verb tense is inconsistent in this sentence. "was" is past tense, but "met" is past perfect tense. This creates a confusing subject-verb agreement issue. A better way to phrase it would be: "It was the policeman who met several young students in the park last night."
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a mistake in subject-verb agreement. In the question "did the policeman meet in the park?" the verb "did" does not agree with its singular subject "policeman." It would be grammatically correct to say "Did the policemen meet in the park?" or "Did the policeman meet in the park?" but not as written.
1	Syntax	The sentence "John put old books in the box" is grammatically correct. In terms of syntax, it follows the standard structure of a simple sentence, consisting of a subject ("John"), an auxiliary verb ("put," indicating past tense), the object ("old books") and the location or destination of the action ("the box"). All these elements work together smoothly to convey a clear meaning without any ambiguity or error.
0	Syntax	This sentence is syntactically incorrect because it requires a linking verb such as "are" after "the monkeys". A corrected version would be: "The monkeys are proud of their leader."
0	Syntax	This sentence lacks a complete thought because it does not have a direct object or complement for the verb "sounded." A more grammatically correct version could be something like "John sounded very tired" or "John sounded very loud," where "tired" and "loud" serve as adjectives describing how John sounded.
0	Syntax	The sentence "I don't know if I should agree." is grammatically correct, but it contains a missing pronoun. A more complete version of the sentence would be "I don't know whether or not I should agree." In its current form, the sentence lacks clarity because it is unclear what the speaker does not know how to agree about. Therefore, while the syntax is technically correct, the semantics are somewhat ambiguous.
1	Syntax	The sentence "John bought a book on the table" is grammatically correct. In terms of syntax, it follows the standard structure of Subject-Verb-Object (SVO), where "John" is the subject, "bought" is the verb, and "a book on the table" is the object. Additionally, the prepositional phrase "on the table" modifies the noun phrase "a book," clarifying its location. Therefore, there are no errors in this sentence related to syntax, semantics, or morphology.
1	Syntax	The sentence "John called the president a fool" is grammatically correct. In terms of syntax, it follows the structure of a simple sentence, consisting of a subject (John), a verb (called), and an object (the president). Additionally, there is an adjective phrase ("a fool") modifying the noun phrase "the president." All these elements work together coherently, making the sentence syntactically well-formed.
1	Syntax	The sentence "I forgot how good beer tastes." is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "I" is a pronoun used as the subject of the sentence. It agrees with the verb "forgot," which is in the past tense. * "forgot" is a verb indicating that the speaker has no recollection or memory of something (in this case, the taste of beer). * "how" introduces a question word clause "how good beer tastes". This type of subordinate clause functions adverbially by modifying the main verb "forgot", providing additional information about it. * "good" is an adjective describing the noun "beer". * "beer" is a singular countable noun referring to an alcoholic beverage made from fermented grain. * "tastes" is a linking verb connecting the subject "beer" to its complement "good". Since we can perceive taste through our senses, using a linking verb here is appropriate.
1	Other Category	The sentence "This teacher is a genius" is grammatically correct because it follows standard English syntax rules for subject-verb agreement and word order. It also contains semantically coherent words that form a meaningful idea. Additionally, there are no morphological errors such as incorrect verb tense or pluralization. Therefore, the sentence falls into the category of being generally correct without any specific error related to syntax, semantics, or morphology.
0	Syntax	The verb tense used in this sentence is incorrect. In standard English, we would say "A good friend remains to me" or "He has remained a good friend to me." Additionally, the word order in the original sentence is unusual and difficult for native speakers to parse. This suggests that there may be some confusion about subject-verb agreement (he remained vs. he remains) as well as word order rules related to passive constructions (a good friend was remained to me by him). Overall, I would recommend revising the sentence to improve its syntax and make it more closely conform to typical English usage patterns.
1	Syntax	The sentence "John ate his noodle quietly" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "John" is a proper noun and serves as the subject of the sentence. * "ate" is the past tense of the verb "eat," indicating that the action occurred in the past. * "his" is a possessive pronoun modifying the direct object "noodle." * "noodle" is a singular countable noun serving as the direct object of the sentence. * "quietly" is an adverb describing how John ate his noodle. Syntax refers to the arrangement of words in a sentence to convey meaning accurately. This sentence follows standard syntactic rules for English grammar.
1	Syntax	The sentence "A smith hammered the metal" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * It contains a subject ("a smith"), a verb ("hammered") and an object ("the metal"). This structure follows the standard pattern for simple English sentences (Subject-Verb-Object). * The verb tense is consistent throughout the sentence - past tense ("hammered") indicating completed action in the past. * Word order and word choice are appropriate. Overall, there are no syntax errors or semantic inconsistencies in this sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Sandy removed her ballet shoes" is grammatically correct because it follows standard subject-verb-object word order (SVO), where "Sandy" is the subject, "removed" is the verb, and "her ballet shoes" is the object. Additionally, the possessive pronoun "her" agrees with its antecedent "Sandy," and the plural noun "shoes" matches the singular determiner "her." Overall, there are no syntax errors or other issues in this sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence "This week will be a difficult one for us." is grammatically correct as it follows standard English syntax rules. It contains a subject ("this week"), a verb ("will be") and an object ("a difficult one for us"). All punctuation marks are used correctly. Additionally, all words are spelled correctly, there is no incorrect word order or ambiguity regarding meaning (semantics), and there are no errors related to word formation such as inflection or derivational morphological issues. Therefore, I would classify this under the category of Syntax since it exhibits proper sentence structure.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Benny worked in a shoe factory when he was a student" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence, "Benny," is clearly identified, and the verb tense is consistent throughout. Additionally, there are no missing or extra words, and the word order follows standard English syntax rules. Therefore, this sentence can be labeled as grammatically correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Everyone hoped that she would sing." is grammatically correct. In terms of syntax, it follows the standard structure of a sentence, having a subject ("everyone"), a subordinating conjunction ("that"), and a predicate ("she would sing"). Additionally, each word within the sentence has been used correctly according to its part of speech, making for proper morphological usage as well. Overall, there are no errors in semantics or any other category present in this sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence "This proved a decisive factor" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "This" serves as the subject of the sentence. * "proved" is the verb in past tense, indicating that something has already happened. * "a decisive factor" functions as the direct object of the sentence, receiving the action of the verb "prove". It consists of the article "a", the adjective "decisive" modifying the noun "factor". Overall, the syntax follows standard English structure (Subject-Verb-Object).
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object (SVO) word order in English, where the subject ("the crocodile") comes first, followed by the verb ("devoured"), and then the object ("the doughnut"). Additionally, each word is correctly spelled and morphologically inflected for number agreement (crocodile is singular as is its corresponding verb form). Furthermore, there is no semantic anomaly or ambiguity since we understand what action is being performed by whom on what.
1	Other Category	The sentence "John is afraid of Bill" is grammatically correct. Therefore, I am returning a 1 for this question. It does not contain any errors related to syntax (incorrect arrangement of words), semantics (meaning), or morphology (word structure). Hence, it falls under the 'Other Category'.
0	Syntax	The sentence "John put under the bathtub" is grammatically incorrect because it lacks a preposition specifying where John placed something. A correct version could be "John put something under the bathtub." In its current form, the syntax of the sentence does not make sense without additional context or information about what object was being acted upon by John's action.
1	Syntax	The sentence "John placed Kim behind the garage" is grammatically correct. In terms of syntax, it has a clear subject ("John"), a verb ("placed") that agrees with the subject in number (singular), and a proper object ("Kim"). Additionally, there's a prepositional phrase ("behind the garage") that modifies the verb by specifying where the action took place. Overall, all the elements fit together well syntactically, making this a grammatically sound sentence.
0	Syntax	The sentence "Kim depends for Sandy" is syntactically incorrect because it lacks a proper verb or preposition after "depends." A more appropriate way to phrase the intended meaning might be "Kim depends on Sandy," where "on" serves as the necessary preposition indicating the relationship between Kim and Sandy.
1	Syntax	The sentence "John put the book in the box" is grammatically correct. In terms of syntax (the arrangement of words to create meaningful sentences), it follows standard English structure: subject ("John") + verb ("put") + object ("the book") + preposition ("in") + object of the preposition ("the box"). All elements fit together correctly and there are no missing or extra components.
1	Syntactically Correct	The sentence "John taught English Syntax to new students." is grammatically correct as it follows standard English syntax rules. It consists of a noun phrase (John), followed by a verb phrase (taught English Syntax) and another noun phrase (to new students). Each part of speech agrees with each other and functions appropriately within the context of the sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence "John regards Bill as a good friend" is grammatically correct. In terms of syntax, it follows the standard structure of Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) where "John" is the subject, "regards" is the verb, and "Bill as a good friend" is the object. Additionally, the possessive noun "Bill's" cannot be used here because we are using "as" to describe what kind of friend Bill is rather than indicating possession or association.
1	Other Category	The sentence "Kim put in the box" is grammatically correct but it lacks context or a complete thought. It would be more appropriate to say something like "Kim put the toy in the box." However, as written, there are no grammatical errors.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct because it follows standard English syntax rules for word order and structure. The subject ("the chickens") comes before the verb ("seem"), and a prepositional phrase ("of the farmer") correctly modifies the verb by telling us who or what the chickens seem fond of. Additionally, there are no spelling, punctuation, or morphological errors in this sentence.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "The" is a definite article used before the singular noun "executive." It agrees in number with its plural counterpart "executives," so it is appropriate here. * "Executives" is the subject of the sentence, agreeing with the verb "be" in third person plural form ("are"). * "Be" is an irregular verb used as a linking verb between the subject "executives" and the adjective phrase "polite." * "Polite" is an adjective describing the behavior expected from the executives. Therefore, there are no grammatical errors or ambiguities in this sentence, making it syntactically sound.
0	Syntax	In this sentence, there is a subject-verb agreement error. The subject of the sentence is "That Fred," which requires a singular verb form. However, the verb used is "was" which is plural. Therefore, the corrected sentence should be either "That Fred was unpopular" or "Fred, who was unpopular, nominated Bill."
1	Syntax	The sentence “They were taking a hard look at possible FTA” is grammatically correct. Here’s why: * “They” is a plural subject pronoun used correctly as the subject of the sentence. * “were taking” is the past continuous tense indicating ongoing action in the past. It agrees with the plural subject “they.” * “a hard look” is an idiomatic expression meaning close examination or scrutiny. This phrase functions as an adverbial modifier, telling us how they looked. * “at” is a preposition introducing the prepositional phrase “at possible FTA,” which tells us where or what they took a hard look at. * “possible FTA” stands for Foreign Trade Agreements, abbreviated using their initial letters (F-T-A). Since it refers to something specific known by the speaker and listener, no article (“a” or “an”) is needed before “FTA.” Therefore, I would classify this question under syntax because we're analyzing the structure and arrangement of words in a sentence.
0	Syntax	The phrase "against the book" is incorrect in this context because it suggests that John was paying money as a form of collateral or security for the book (as if he were buying it on credit). A more appropriate preposition would be "for," indicating payment made directly to the recipient ("John paid me for the book"). Alternatively, if John was literally making payment by handing over the physical book, then "John paid me with the book" could be used instead.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct. It follows standard English syntax rules for word order and structure. The subject of the sentence is "the committee," followed by the verb "will study" and the object "the feasibility of setting up a national computer network." All elements are in their proper place and contribute to a coherent meaning.
0	Syntax	The sentence "We made them be rude" contains a syntactic error known as overnegation. In English, when using modal verbs such as "make," we typically use a single negation instead of double negatives. A corrected version would be "We made them be impolite" or "We made them rude."
1	Syntax	The sentence "After reading the pamphlet, Judy threw it into the garbage can." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules for syntax (word order) in English. In this case, the subject ("Judy") comes before the verb ("threw"), and the object ("it") comes between the verb and its preposition phrase ("into the garbage can"). This structure creates a clear and coherent meaning for the sentence.
0	Syntax	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in this sentence. The plural subject "students" does not agree with the singular verb form "reads." It should be changed to "read," making the corrected sentence "Students studying English read Conrad's Heart of Darkness while at university."
1	Other Category	The sentence "I read some of the book." is grammatically correct but it lacks specificity about what specifically was being read from the book. It would be better if a chapter or page number is specified for clarity. However, as it stands, there's no grammatical mistake in the sentence, so it falls under the 'Other Category'.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Most of the fruit is rotten" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "most of the fruit," which is a quantifier phrase acting as a determiner for the noun "fruit." This phrase modifies the noun by specifying how much of the fruit we're referring to. Following the subject is the linking verb "is," connecting it to the predicate adjective "rotten," describing the state or condition of the subject. Therefore, no errors can be found related to syntax in this sentence.
0	Semantics	The sentence "Neither of students failed" is grammatically incorrect because it lacks a determiner before "students." A more appropriate way to phrase this idea would be "Neither of the students failed," or "Both students succeeded." Additionally, logically speaking, if neither student failed then both must have passed or succeeded instead.
0	Syntax	In the phrase "some of water," the definite article "the" or no determiner is needed before "water." The corrected version would be "I drank some of the water" or "I drank some water."
0	Syntax	The noun phrase "a gold hair" is incorrect because it violates the agreement rule between articles (a/an) and adjectives. Gold is an uncountable mass noun here, so we cannot use the article 'a' before it. We can say either "golden hair", if we want to emphasize the color; or simply "a hair of gold," where "hair" becomes countable.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct because it follows standard subject-verb-object word order (SVO) and has a clear noun-modifier relationship between "the boy" and "in the doorway." Additionally, the verb tense is consistent throughout the sentence, making it easy to understand who is doing what.
1	Semantics	The sentence is grammatically correct but may contain a logical error because dogs generally do not try to bite themselves under normal circumstances. However, if the context suggests otherwise (for example, the dog has fleas or mites), then the sentence can be considered semantically acceptable.
0	Syntax	The error in this sentence is syntactic because it has incorrect subject-verb agreement. In English, we use "he" as a singular subject and "wash" as the base form of the verb when the subject is third person singular (he, she, it). However, the reflexive pronoun for third person singular subjects is "himself," not "yourself." So, the grammatically correct version of this sentence would be "He washed himself."
0	Syntax	The sentence "John is easy to please Kim" is syntactically incorrect because it lacks a preposition such as 'for' or 'with' after 'easy'. A grammatically correct version would be either "John is easy for/to please" or "John is easy to please **with** something (that implies pleasure)".
0	Syntax	This sentence is missing a noun after "intelligent." A complete sentence requires both a subject and a predicate, but here the predicate ("seemed to be intelligent") lacks a clear subject for the verb "to be" to agree with. In order for the sentence to be grammatically correct, it must include a specific noun or pronoun as its subject. For example, "The students seemed to be intelligent" would be a complete sentence with proper syntax.
1	Other Category	The sentence "John tried to please Stephen" is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple tense verb phrase ("tried") followed by an infinitive verb phrase ("to please"). Both "John" and "Stephen" are proper nouns functioning as subjects and objects respectively. Thus, there are no syntax, morphological or semantic errors present in this sentence.
0	Semantics	This sentence is semantically incorrect because it uses a metaphorical expression in a way that doesn't make sense. While "John" can be referred to as a person, a "fountain in the park" refers to an inanimate object. Therefore, it cannot logically or meaningfully serve as the direct object of the verb "believe." The sentence would only make sense if rephrased using appropriate figurative language (e.g., "We regarded John as the fountain of knowledge in the park.")
0	Syntax	The subject ("it") does not have a clear antecedent, making the sentence syntactically incorrect. In order for the sentence to be grammatically correct, it's necessary to specify what or who "it" refers to. For example, "The dog tries to leave the country." would be a grammatically correct version of this sentence.
1	Other Category	The sentence "John tries to leave the country." is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple tense verb phrase "tries" followed by the infinitive "to leave", and the noun phrase "the country". All words are used appropriately according to their part of speech, there is no subject-verb agreement error or any other grammatical mistake. Thus, it falls under the category of 'Other' as there is nothing wrong syntactically, semantically, or morphologically.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Under the bed seems to be a fun place to hide" is grammatically correct. The prepositional phrase "under the bed" correctly modifies the location of where something ("a fun place to hide") seems to be. Additionally, the verb tense agrees throughout the sentence (the present simple tense). Therefore, there are no syntax errors in this sentence.
0	Syntax	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in this sentence. The verb "is" must agree in number with its subject, but here it does not. The subject "there" is singular, so the verb should also be singular. However, the plural noun "sheep" follows the verb instead. Changing the verb to "are" would fix the issue, or changing the phrase after the verb to a singular form (e.g., "a sheep"). Thus, the corrected sentence could read as either "There is believed to be a sheep in the park," or "There are believed to be sheep in the park."
0	Syntax	The verb tense used in this sentence is incorrect. "I hope to **study** in France" uses the base form of the verb after "to," but it requires a helping verb such as "will." A grammatically correct version could be "I hope I will study in France" or simply "I want to study in France."
1	Other Category	The sentence "John can kick the ball" is grammatically correct and has a clear meaning (semantically correct), so there are no issues with syntax or morphology. Therefore, it falls under the category "Other." Specifically, the sentence demonstrates proper subject-verb agreement ("John," singular, agrees with the third person present tense verb "can"), appropriate word order (subject-auxiliary verb-main verb-object), and correct use of determiners (the definite article "the").
0	Syntax	In English, we cannot say "John will rain tomorrow." This is because "rain" is an intransitive verb, meaning it does not take a direct object. Also, weather conditions such as rain, snow, etc. do not take agents (like John). Therefore, the correct way to express future tense for this scenario would be "It will rain tomorrow."
0	Syntax	The error in this sentence lies in subject-auxiliary verb agreement. In English, we use a form of "to be" (in this case, "there is") instead of "there are" when referring to the expectation of something happening in the future ("will rain"). Therefore, the corrected version would be: "We expect there to be a chance of rain."
1	Syntax	The sentence "John was found in the office" is grammatically correct. In terms of syntax, it follows a standard subject-verb-object structure (SVO), where "John" is the subject, "was found" is the verb phrase, and "in the office" is a prepositional phrase acting as an adverbial indicating location. All elements of the sentence fit together coherently without any awkward constructions or violations of grammatical rules, making it a syntactically sound statement.
0	Syntax	In English, we use the auxiliary verb "did" instead of "do" for past tense questions. Also, the main verb should be in base form after a helping verb such as "did". So, the correct way to phrase the question would be "Did the child **go** to school?" or "Was the child in school?" The original sentence is ungrammatical because it uses "be" incorrectly after "did."
1	Syntax	The sentence "It did not rain" is grammatically correct. The subject "it" refers to the weather, and "did not rain" is the verb phrase in past tense, indicating a negative statement about something that happened (or didn't happen) in the past. The syntax follows standard English structure, making it grammatically sound.
0	Syntax	The sentence "John wants not to leave the town" contains a double negative, which can make it unclear what the intended meaning is. In standard English, we try to avoid using two negatives in the same clause because they can create confusion. A better way to phrase this sentence would be "John doesn't want to leave the town." Alternatively, if the intended meaning is that John wants to stay in the town, then the sentence could be phrased as "John wants to remain in the town."
1	Syntax	The sentence "Mary likes to tour art galleries, but Bill hates to." is grammatically correct. It has a clear subject ("Mary" and "Bill") and predicate ("likes," "tour," and "hates"), and uses proper punctuation. Additionally, it employs parallel structure by using the infinitive form of verbs after both subjects, making it easy to understand and flow smoothly.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a double negative (needn't + not), which results in a logically inconsistent meaning. It would be grammatically correct to say either "They need not take this exam" or "They don't have to take this exam."
1	Syntax	The sentence "Ann may spend her vacation in Italy" is grammatically correct. In terms of syntax, it follows the standard structure of a sentence, consisting of a subject ("Ann"), an auxiliary verb ("may"), a main verb ("spend"), and an object ("her vacation"). Additionally, the prepositional phrase "in Italy" provides more information about where Ann will be spending her vacation. Overall, there are no errors in word order or form that would make this sentence ungrammatical.
1	Syntax	The sentence "They love to play golf, but I do not." is grammatically correct. In this sentence, there is no error related to syntax, semantics, or morphology. Therefore, it's syntactically correct as well. Hence, the label returned is 1.
1	Semantics	The sentence "George has spent a lot of money, hasn't he?" is grammatically correct. It contains a tag question ("hasn't he") that seeks confirmation for the statement made before it. Tag questions usually follow statements about the subject (in this case, "George"). They can be positive or negative and require a response from the listener. In this example, the speaker is seeking confirmation that George did indeed spend a lot of money.
0	Syntax	The subject-auxiliary inversion found in the clause "scarcely could he do" is ungrammatical in modern standard English. It appears to be modeled on older forms of English where such constructions were acceptable. In contemporary usage, it would need to be expressed as either "He could scarcely do anything worth mentioning" or "Scarcely could he have done anything worth mentioning."
1	Syntax	The sentence "We never found any of the unicorns." is grammatically correct. The subject "we" agrees with the verb "found," and the object "unicorns" follows a prepositional phrase starting with "of," which modifies it. Additionally, there are no apparent morphological errors or semantic inconsistencies in the sentence.
1	Other Category	The sentence “One of Korea's most famous pots wrote these lines” appears to be grammatically correct but contains a spelling error in the word “poets.” Therefore, I will assume it was a typo and rate it as correct. However, if we consider the original sentence to contain the incorrect spelling, then my response would be different.
1	Syntax	The sentence appears grammatically correct. It has a clear subject ("somebody"), verb ("struck"), and object ("the unidentified victim"). Additionally, it contains appropriate prepositional phrases ("during the early morning hours") and articles before nouns. No errors can be found in terms of syntax, semantics, or morphology.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct because it follows standard subject-verb agreement rules (the singular subject "car" matches with the past tense verb "was driven"). Additionally, the word order is appropriate for a simple declarative sentence.
1	Other Category	The sentence "Ricky can be relied on" is grammatically correct. It has a simple subject ("Ricky") and a predicate verb ("can be relied on"). The verb phrase "can be relied on" indicates ability or possibility, and it agrees with the singular subject "Ricky." Therefore, there is no error in syntax, semantics, or morphology.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct. It follows the standard structure of a simple past tense verb ("was") followed by a past participle ("slept"). In this case, the phrase "in the bed" functions as an adverbial complement specifying where the action took place.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a passive construction where the direct object ("a pound") has been promoted to subject position and the original subject ("the book") has become the agent expressed by the preposition phrase "by the book". However, it is unclear what exactly is being weighed against the book since weights are typically measured on scales or balances rather than being weighed against other objects. Therefore, the intended meaning of the sentence cannot be accurately conveyed due to its syntactic structure, making it confusing for readers.
1	Semantics	The sentence is grammatically correct, but it is semantically incomplete because it requires additional context or information to be fully understood. The phrase "who do you think" implies a question about someone's identity, so a complete sentence might be "Who do you think Tom saw at the party last night?" However, without any further context provided, I cannot determine whether there is a specific error related to syntax, morphology, or other linguistic features. Therefore, the category for this answer is semantics.
1	Syntax	The sentence "he had spent five thousand dollars" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * He is a pronoun used as the subject of the sentence. It agrees with the verb had spent (past perfect tense) in number and person. * Spent is a past participle form of spend, which indicates the action has been completed before another time reference or action. In this case, it refers to a past event. * Five thousand dollars is a noun phrase functioning as the direct object of the verb. It consists of a cardinal number (five), followed by thousand, a unit of currency ($), and a plural countable noun (dollars). No article is required because the quantity is specific enough without it. Therefore, the syntax of the sentence is correct, making the overall structure coherent and meaningful.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a syntactic error because it lacks a proper subject-verb agreement. In particular, the pronoun 'she' should be used instead of 'her' as the subject of the embedded question. Thus, a grammatically correct version would read as follows: 'Fed knows which politician she to vote for.' However, even after fixing this mistake, the resulting sentence remains semantically problematic due to the incorrect use of the infinitive form 'to vote'. A more natural way to express such a thought might involve rephrasing the whole thing; e.g., 'Fed knows which politician she should vote for.'
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a pronoun ("that") without an explicit antecedent. It's unclear what "that" refers to - was it the way he fixed the computer or the fact that he fixed the computer? A clearer version would be "How did you guess that he fixed the computer (so well)?" or "How did you guess (the fact) that he fixed the computer?"
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct. It follows a standard structure of subject ("the committee"), verb ("knows"), and object ("whose efforts"). Additionally, it includes a subordinate clause ("to achieve peace") and uses the possessive form "whose" correctly to indicate possession by the implied antecedent "committee."
0	Syntax	The sentence is missing an apostrophe in the word "house's." It should be "Which house's does your friend live in?" or "Where does your friend live?" if we want to keep it simple. In English, when asking a question about possession, we use an apostrophe followed by the letter s (i.e., 's) after the noun indicating ownership. Therefore, since we are referring to the specific house where the friend lives, we need to include the possessive form of the noun "house" in our question.
1	Syntax	The sentence "the baker from whom I bought these bagels left" is grammatically correct. It follows the rules for subject-verb agreement, word order, and case assignment in English syntax. Specifically, it uses a relative clause ("from whom I bought these bagels") to modify the noun phrase "the baker." This type of construction is common in formal written English, although some speakers may avoid it in favor of less complex structures such as "the baker who sold me these bagels." Nonetheless, there is nothing inherently ungrammatical about the original sentence, so I will assign it a score of 1 for being syntactically well-formed.
1	Other Category	The sentence “I found the place where we can relax” is grammatically correct. It contains a subject (“I”), a verb tense form (“found”) that agrees with the subject, and an object complement (“the place where we can relax”). This sentence’s structure follows standard syntactic rules for forming simple declarative statements in English. Moreover, its semantic meaning conveys a clear message about discovering a location suitable for relaxation without any ambiguity or inconsistency. Additionally, there aren't any morphological issues such as incorrect word forms, spelling errors, etc., making it free from grammatical flaws concerning morphemes within words themselves.
0	Syntax	The phrase "with whom" creates a redundancy in the sentence because it includes two prepositions, "with" and "in," both introducing "whom." A corrected version would be either "Jack is the person Jenny fell in love with" or "Jack is the person with whom Jenny fell in love." Both options convey the same meaning; however, the former follows more natural speech patterns in modern English.
1	Other Category	The sentence "There is a bench to sit on." is grammatically correct. However, it could be improved for clarity by saying "There is a bench where one can sit." or "There is a bench for sitting." In its original form, the sentence implies that there is only one specific place to sit (on the bench), whereas the revised forms make clear that the bench itself is what is available for use when sitting. Nonetheless, since the prompt asks for a simple evaluation of grammaticality without making stylistic recommendations, I will assign this sentence a score of 1.
1	Syntax	The sentence "I met the man who grows peaches" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules for subject-verb agreement, word order, and tense consistency. Specifically, the subject "I" matches with the verb "met," and the relative clause "who grows peaches" modifies "the man" correctly. Additionally, there is no ambiguity or confusion regarding the meaning of the sentence. Therefore, there are no syntactic, semantic, morphological, or other errors present in this sentence.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a pronoun "his" but there is no clear antecedent (the word that the pronoun refers back to) earlier in the sentence. It would be grammatically correct if we add a specific noun before the pronoun, for example: "Which topic did you choose without getting **John's** approval?"
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a misplaced modifier error. The phrase "because Mary talked about" is modifying the word "topic," but it should be modifying the subject of the sentence, which is implied to be "you." A corrected version would be: "Which topic did you get bored with because Mary talked about it?"
1	Other Category	The sentence "That is the reason why he resigned." is grammatically correct. It has a clear subject ("that"), a linking verb ("is"), and a predicate noun ("the reason"). Additionally, it contains a subordinating conjunction ("why") introducing a clause that modifies the main clause. All elements are used appropriately and no spelling or morphological errors can be found.
1	Other Category	The sentence “It bothers me that John coughs” is grammatically correct. Therefore, I am assigning it a score of 1. Regarding its categorization, there is no clear error related to syntax (the arrangement of words), semantics (meaning), or morphology (word structure). Instead, this sentence represents a statement about someone’s annoyance due to another person's behavior, making the category ‘Other.’
1	Syntax	The sentence "To please John is easy" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "To please John" is a non-finite gerund clause functioning as the subject of the sentence. It contains the infinitive marker "to," followed by the verb "please." This construction is grammatical because it names the action (pleasing) and its object (John), forming a complete unit that can function as a noun phrase. * "is easy" is the linking verb that connects the subject ("to please John") to the complement ("easy"), indicating the degree or manner in which the action takes place. * Therefore, the syntax of the sentence is well-formed and follows standard rules for word order, agreement, and structure.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Kim is eager to please Tom." is grammatically correct. It follows standard English syntax rules for subject-verb-object word order. The subject ("Kim") is followed by a linking verb ("is"), and then the predicate adjective phrase ("eager to please Tom") describes the subject.
0	Syntax	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in this sentence. "We" is a plural noun, but "bites" is a singular verb. The correct form would be "That we invaded Iraq really bites." (plural) or "That our invasion of Iraq really bites." (singular).
1	Syntax	The sentence "It annoys me that Fido barks" is grammatically correct. In this sentence, "it" is a pronoun referring to the situation or fact of Fido barking, "annoys" is a verb indicating the emotional response of the speaker, "me" is an object pronoun receiving the action of the verb, and "that Fido barks" is a subordinate clause modifying the main clause by providing additional information about what is annoying the speaker. Therefore, there are no syntax errors in this sentence.
0	Syntax	The subject-verb agreement in this sentence is incorrect. In present perfect tense, as used here ("achieved" implies a past action with current relevance), the verb must agree with both the subject and auxiliary verb. Here, "who" is singular but "were" is plural, causing a mismatch. Changing it to "Who achieved the best result was Angela." or "Those who achieved the best results included Angela." would make the syntax correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "It was the peasant girl who got it" is grammatically correct. The subject-verb agreement is correct as "it" is a singular subject and "was" is its corresponding verb. Additionally, there are no misspelled words or incorrect use of punctuation marks. Therefore, I have labeled this sentence as syntactically correct because all grammatical components such as nouns, verbs, adjectives, pronouns, etc., follow proper syntax rules.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a mistake in subject-verb agreement. The subject of the sentence is "that kind of person," which requires a singular verb form. However, the verb used here is "are" instead of "is." Additionally, there is redundancy in using both "anyone" and "to look after" together; it would be better to say either "That kind of person is hard to find anyone who can look after them" or "That kind of person is hard to find someone to look after."
1	Syntax	The sentence "A sick owl doesn't hunt mice." is grammatically correct as it follows the rules of English syntax. It has a subject ("a sick owl"), an auxiliary verb ("doesn't"), and a predicate ("hunt mice"). Additionally, each word is correctly conjugated for tense and number.
0	Syntax	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in this sentence. The subject "each candidate" requires a singular verb form, but "will be admitted" is plural. Therefore, the corrected version of this sentence would be: "Each candidate who has an interest in semantics will be admitted to the department."
0	Syntax	The correct form should be "Each author who contributes..." instead of "whose contribution". In English, we use "who" or "that" to refer to people, while "whose" refers to possession. Therefore, it's incorrect to say "each author whose contribution." Instead, we need to rephrase the sentence as "Each author who contributes..." or "Each author whose contributions are...."
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a subject-verb agreement error. The verb "got" does not agree with its plural subject "we." It should be changed to "have gotten" or "get" for grammatical correctness. Additionally, the exclamation mark may not be necessary depending on context, but it doesn't affect the syntax directly.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a double negative ("even" + "not"), which can lead to confusion as it contradicts itself (the speaker is expressing certainty). A corrected version could be: "I'm sure we have these tickets!" or "We must have these tickets for sure!"
1	Semantics	The sentence is grammatically correct and semantically meaningful. All words are used appropriately within their context and there are no spelling or morphological errors. Additionally, the sentence has a clear syntax structure. Therefore, it returns 1 (correct). The category for this question would be 'Semantics', as we are considering whether the meaning of the sentence makes sense and all the words have been used appropriately.
1	Syntax	The sentence "It isn't because Sue said anything bad about me that I'm angry" is grammatically correct. The clause "it isn't because Sue said anything bad about me" functions as a noun clause acting as the subject of the sentence. This type of complex sentence structure where a dependent clause comes before an independent clause is called a subjacency violation but it is still considered grammatical despite being less common than other structures.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct. The clause "That he was hungry" is a subordinate clause acting as an adverbial of reason for the main clause "John whined". Both clauses contain subjects ("he", "John") and verbs ("was", "whined"), so they're both independent phrases but together form a complex sentence. Additionally, there is no missing punctuation or any other grammatical errors.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a misplaced direct object "a book." In English, the typical word order for a simple sentence is subject-verb-object (SVO). However, when there are multiple objects or additional information added to a sentence using phrases such as "after the party," it's crucial to maintain proper syntax by placing each element correctly within the structure of the sentence. A corrected version would be: "I gave Mary a book after the party."
0	Syntax	The phrase "as for" is used incorrectly in this context. A more appropriate way to express this idea would be: "Because she's so pleasant, I really like Mary." Alternatively, if the speaker wants to emphasize their fondness for Mary specifically, they could say: "As for Mary, I really like her because she's so pleasant." In its current form, the sentence structure is confusing and unclear due to a misplaced adverbial clause.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("he"), a verb phrase ("may hate") that agrees with the subject in number, a noun clause ("those that criticize Carter") functioning as the direct object of the verb phrase, and a contrast transition ("but") followed by another independent clause ("it doesn't matter"). Both clauses express related but distinct ideas about the subject's attitude toward criticism of President Carter, making the sentence logical and coherent.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a subject-verb agreement error. In the present tense, the verb should match the number (singular or plural) of its subject. Here, the subject "With no job" is singular, but the verb "would" requires a plural subject. A corrected version could read: "Without a job, John wouldn't be happy."
0	Syntax	The error in this sentence is a subject-verb agreement problem. In this case, "much" requires a singular verb, so it should be "has." Therefore, the corrected sentence would read: "I have much of the manuscript left to type." However, even with the correction, the sentence still sounds awkward because we usually use "a lot of" instead of "much of" when referring to uncountable nouns like "manuscript," so ideally, it should say, "I have a lot of the manuscript left to type."
1	Other Category	The sentence "He's a more reliable man" is grammatically correct. It contains a linking verb ("is") followed by a comparative adjective phrase ("more reliable"). The subject ("he") is singular, so we use the third person present tense form of the verb ("is"), making the syntax of the sentence correct. Additionally, there are no semantic or morphological errors in the sentence. Therefore, it falls under the category of "Other."
0	Syntax	The negation in the sentence is incorrect. Instead of saying "any trouble is what I don't want," it should be "I don't want any trouble." In the original sentence, "what" refers back to nothing, making the meaning unclear. By switching the word order, we can make the negation clearer and create a more coherent sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence "They may grow as high as bamboo" is grammatically correct. It consists of a subject ("they"), modal verb ("may"), main verb ("grow"), time adverbial clause ("as \_ as"), comparative word ("high"), and object complement ("bamboo"). Therefore, it meets all the requirements for syntactic well-formedness in English.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a subject-verb agreement error. The plural noun "some" requires a plural verb, but instead we have the singular verb "made." A corrected version would be: "Some of them make as many errors as 20."
0	Syntax	The subject-verb agreement in this sentence is incorrect. In English, reflexive pronouns (e.g., myself, yourself, himself) must agree in number with their antecedents. Here, the antecedent is "Sally," which is singular. Therefore, the correct reflexive pronoun would be "herself." So, a corrected version of the sentence would read: "Sally kissed herself."
1	Syntax	The sentence "Drew believes I think Rosie loves magazine ads." is grammatically correct. In terms of syntax, it follows the rules for word order and structure in English. The subject "Drew" comes before the verb "believes," and each clause has a clear subject and predicate. Additionally, there are no missing or extraneous words, and all punctuation marks are used correctly.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Dave, Dan, Erin, Jaime, and Alina left" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules for subject-verb agreement (the plural subject "Dave, Dan, Erin, Jaime, and Alina" matches the plural verb "left") and word order (subject before verb). Additionally, all proper nouns used as subjects are capitalized correctly.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Hopefully, we'll make it through the winter without snow" is grammatically correct. It contains a subordinating conjunction ("without") introducing a clause ("without snow"), which modifies the main clause ("we'll make it through the winter"). Additionally, there is an adverbial element ("hopefully") at the beginning of the sentence, which expresses the speaker's attitude towards the proposition expressed by the rest of the sentence. Overall, the syntax of the sentence follows standard rules for English grammar.
0	Syntax	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in this sentence. In English, a singular subject requires a singular verb. However, in this case, we have two singular subjects ("Blue leather" and "Betsy") but only one verb ("shows"). To fix the error, we could either use two verbs (e.g., "Blue leather attests that Betsy is pretty.") or combine the subjects into a plural form (e.g., "The blue leather and Betsy show that she is pretty.").
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object (SVO) structure of English syntax. The subject "Gwen" is a proper noun that refers to a person, the verb "hit" indicates an action performed by the subject, and the object "the baseball" identifies what was hit. Additionally, there are no spelling or morphological errors in the sentence.
0	Syntax	The correct form of the verb to be after the pronoun "you" is "know," not "hit." Additionally, there needs to be a punctuation mark between "that" and "you" to separate the clause. So the corrected sentence would read: "I knew that you hit the answer."
1	Semantics	The sentence is grammatically correct. It consists of two independent clauses joined by the coordinating conjunction "or." Each clause has a subject ("I") and a predicate verb ("have lost"). Semantically, both clauses express alternative possibilities, making the statement meaningful and coherent.
1	Syntax	The sentence "It was a brand new car that he bought" is grammatically correct. In terms of syntax, it follows the rules for word order and structure in English. The subject ("it") comes first, followed by the linking verb ("was"), the adjective phrase ("a brand new car"), and the relative clause ("that he bought"). All punctuation is used correctly as well.
1	Syntax	The sentence "He likes cookies and he hates crumb cake." is grammatically correct. It follows standard English syntax rules for forming a compound sentence, where two simple sentences (or independent clauses) are joined by a coordinating conjunction ("and" in this case). Each clause has a subject ("he") and a verb ("likes," "hates"), so they can stand alone as separate sentences if needed. Additionally, each clause expresses a complete thought or idea. Therefore, there are no syntax errors in this sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence "They chased the man with the car" is grammatically correct. In this sentence, "they" is the subject, "chased" is the verb, "the man" is the direct object, and "with the car" is a prepositional phrase acting as an adverbial phrase modifying how they chased the man (presumably by using the car). Therefore, it follows standard English syntax rules for word order and structure.
1	Syntax	The sentence "I didn't have a red cent" is grammatically correct. It follows the standard Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) word order in English. Additionally, the idiomatic expression "a red cent" is used correctly to indicate that the speaker had no money.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a syntactic error because there are two separate noun phrases ("the book of poems" and "from Blackwell") connected by the conjunction "and," but no verb connecting them. A possible correction could be "Reading the book of poems and the one from Blackwell takes a very long time."
1	Syntax	The sentence "the one with a red cover takes a very long time to read" is grammatically correct. It follows standard English syntax rules for word order and structure. Here's a breakdown of the sentence: * "The one": This refers to a specific object or entity being described. * "with a red cover": This prepositional phrase modifies "the one," providing more information about it. * "takes a very long time": This verb phrase describes the action taken by "the one." * "to read": This infinitive phrase functions as the direct object of the verb phrase, specifying what is being done. Overall, there are no apparent morphological, syntactic, or semantic errors in this sentence.
1	Other Category	The sentence "John has a fear of dogs." is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple subject ("John") and a predicate ("has a fear of dogs"). The noun phrase "a fear of dogs" contains a countable noun ("fear") modified by an article ("a"), followed by a prepositional phrase ("of dogs") indicating what the fear is about. This sentence does not contain any errors in syntax, semantics, or morphology, so it falls under the category of "Other".
0	Syntax	In English, we typically use a singular noun followed by a verb to indicate possession or attachment (e.g., "the building's roof"). However, when it comes to linking verbs such as "is" or "are", we need to maintain subject-verb agreement. Here, the subject ("building") is singular, so the corresponding linking verb should be "is". Therefore, the correct form would be "The building's roof is leaking," instead of "The building's the roof is leaking."
0	Syntax	In this sentence, there is a misplaced determiner "the" before "coat." The noun phrase "panther's coat" already has its own determiner "panther's," so it doesn't need another article "the" before "coat." Therefore, the corrected form of the sentence would be: "The panther's coat is dark black."
1	Syntax	The sentence "Colin asked if they could get a mortgage" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * Colin is the subject of the main clause and is in the third person singular form. This matches the verb "asked," which is the past tense of the verb "ask." * "If they could get a mortgage" is a subordinate clause added to the main clause for additional information. In this case, it functions as the direct object of the verb "asked." * The pronoun "they" refers to a group of people who can potentially get a mortgage. It agrees with its antecedent (the word or phrase it refers back to) and has a clear referent. * The verb "could" indicates possibility or ability, while "get" is the infinitive form used after modal verbs such as "can," "could," etc. * Finally, "a mortgage" is a countable noun modified by the article "a" indicating that we don't have any specific mortgage in mind but rather any mortgage available.
0	Semantics	This sentence is semantically incorrect because it implies that the man who got into the taxi committed the robbery. However, there is no evidence provided in the sentence for this causal relationship between these two events. It's possible that the speaker simply witnessed a man getting into a taxi but has no knowledge about what he did afterward. To make the sentence semantically correct, we would need additional information connecting the two actions or establishing their temporal sequence (e.g., 'The man I saw get into the cab was the same person who later robbed the bank').
1	Syntax	The sentence "I know you eat asparagus." is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "I", which is a pronoun in the first person singular. The verb is "know" which is conjugated correctly for the present tense third-person singular. The object is "you," another pronoun, followed by the base form of the verb "eat". Finally, there's the noun phrase "asparagus", serving as the direct object of the embedded infinitive clause "you eat asparagus". Thus, syntactically, it checks out.
1	Syntax	The sentence "John's drum will always bother me." is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "John's drum" is a noun phrase where "John's" functions as a possessive determiner indicating ownership or association. This structure is syntactically sound. * "will always bother" consists of an auxiliary verb "will," followed by another auxiliary verb "always," modifying the main verb "bother." This construction is grammatically correct. * Finally, the subject "John's drum" is connected to the predicate "will always bother me" through the linking verb "bother." Overall, there are no syntax errors in this sentence.
1	Semantics	The sentence "An evil thought struck Dave" is grammatically correct. The word "struck" here can be used metaphorically to mean that a sudden idea or realization came into Dave's mind (in this case, an "evil thought"). This usage is idiomatic but acceptable in standard English. Therefore, there is no error in syntax, morphology, or any other category; hence, it falls under semantics due to its figurative meaning.
1	Syntax	The sentence "In the classroom John put the book on the table." is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "John" who is performing the action of putting something (the object) onto a surface (a prepositional phrase). This type of structure follows a basic Subject-Verb-Object order (SVO), making it syntactically sound.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Phillip gave the medal to the soldier" is grammatically correct because it follows the subject-verb-object (SVO) word order in English, where Philip is the subject, gave is the verb, and the medal and the soldier are the objects. Additionally, the use of preposition to indicates a relationship between two entities, i.e., giving something from one person to another. Therefore, there are no syntax errors in this sentence.
0	Syntax	The verb "eat" needs a subject, so it should be "Andy eats." Also, we need a conjunction between two independent clauses ("Heidi thinks" and "Andy eats"), such as "that". So the corrected sentence would be: "Heidi thinks that Andy eats salmon-flavored candy bars."
1	Syntax	The sentence "Heidi thinks that Andy should eat salmon flavored candy bars." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules for English syntax. It has a subject ("Heidi"), a verb ("thinks"), and an object ("that Andy should eat salmon flavored candy bars"). Additionally, each clause and phrase within the sentence is correctly structured according to the rules of English grammar.
1	Syntax	The sentence "He danced" is grammatically correct. In this case, the subject "he" is a pronoun that agrees with its verb "danced." Additionally, the word order follows standard English syntax rules, where the subject precedes the verb.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a subject-verb agreement error. In present tense sentences, the verb must agree in number (singular or plural) with the subject. Here, the subject "Calvin" is singular but the verb "did" is the past tense form of the plural verb "do." A correct version would be "Did Calvin do his homework?"
1	Syntax	The sentence "Sylvia was slapping Jeff upside the head in martial arts class" is grammatically correct. It contains a clear subject ("Sylvia"), verb ("was slapping"), and object ("Jeff"). Additionally, it uses appropriate prepositions ("upside," "in") to indicate location and time. Therefore, there are no syntax errors in this sentence.
1	Other Category	The sentence “If I am a rich man, I’d buy a diamond ring” is grammatically correct. It contains both a conditional clause (“If I am a rich man”) and a main clause (“I’d buy a diamond ring”), which are connected by a comma. Both clauses contain correct subject-verb agreement and appropriate verb tenses. Additionally, there are no spelling or word choice errors in the sentence. Therefore, it can be classified as grammatically correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence “If he were a rich man, he’d buy a diamond ring” is grammatically correct. It contains a subjunctive mood, expressed by “were,” which is used to describe hypothetical or unlikely events. In this case, the speaker is imagining a scenario where the subject (he) has enough money to purchase a luxury item (a diamond ring). This usage is acceptable and clear, making the sentence syntactically sound.
1	Syntax	The sentence "John is likely to leave" is grammatically correct. In this sentence, "likely" functions as a predicate adjective modifying the subject "John," and the infinitival phrase "to leave" serves as the complement of the adjective "likely." This structure follows standard rules for English syntax.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct because it follows standard subject-verb agreement rules (the singular subject "manager" matches with the singular verb "laughed"). Additionally, there are no obvious morphological or semantic errors present.
0	Semantics	The sentence "Was sunk." is grammatically incorrect because it lacks a proper subject or context for the verb tense to make sense. In order for this sentence to be complete and meaningful, there needs to be a clear subject and potentially additional information such as an object or other modifiers. For example, a more complete version could be "The ship was sunk by enemy forces.", where the subject (the ship) and past tense verb form ("was sunk") provide enough context for understanding.
0	Syntax	The question contains a common mistake known as a tense shift. In the main clause of the question ("did you think"), the past simple tense is used, but in the subordinate clause ("kissed the gorilla"), the past simple tense is mixed with the present perfect tense ("has kissed"). To fix the error, both clauses should use either the past simple or the present perfect tense consistently. Here's a corrected version of the sentence using the past simple tense throughout: "Who did you think kissed the gorilla?" Alternatively, here's another corrected version using the present perfect tense throughout: "Who do you think has kissed the gorilla?"
1	Syntax	The sentence "Have you seen my model airplane collection?" is grammatically correct. The auxiliary verb "have" is used correctly as a helping verb to form a question in the present perfect tense. The subject-auxiliary inversion is also done correctly. Additionally, there are no spelling or morphological errors in the sentence. Therefore, it falls under the category of syntax where all grammatical rules have been followed correctly.
1	Syntax	The sentence "It seems that Lucy was mugged" is grammatically correct. The subject-auxiliary inversion ("seems...was") is used appropriately to form a subordinate clause indicating uncertainty or probability. All words are spelled correctly, and there are no punctuation errors. Additionally, the morphological forms (e.g., tense marking) on verbs and nouns are appropriate for standard English usage. Therefore, I would classify this as a syntax question because it concerns the arrangement of words and phrases within the sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence "I ate a salad that was filled with lima beans" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules for English syntax (sentence structure). The subject of the sentence ("I") comes first, followed by the verb ("ate"), then the object ("a salad"), and finally the modifying phrase ("that was filled with lima beans"). All of these elements are arranged in a logical and coherent way, making the sentence easy to understand. Additionally, all of the words are spelled correctly and there are no punctuation errors. Overall, the sentence demonstrates good command of English grammar and language use.
1	Syntax	The sentence "There were four men arriving at the station when I pulled up." is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "There were" is a correctly used linking verb followed by the subject complement "four men," indicating the number of men present. * "Four men" serves as the subject of the sentence and agrees with the plural verb form "were." * "Arriving" is the present participle of the verb "arrive," modifying the subject "four men." It indicates ongoing action simultaneous with the main clause. * "At the station" functions as a prepositional phrase specifying where the arrival occurs. * "When I pulled up" is another adverbial clause further describing the context of the event using the past tense "pulled up." This clause adds temporal detail but does not affect the grammaticality of the rest of the sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Jean is reluctant to dance" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Jean," which is followed by a linking verb, "is." The predicate of the sentence is "reluctant to dance," which modifies the subject using the infinitive phrase "to dance." The syntax of the sentence follows standard English rules for word order and structure.
1	Syntax	The sentence "I want her to dance" is grammatically correct. In terms of syntax, it follows the structure of a subjecct-verb-object (SVO) sentence, where "I" is the subject, "want" is the verb, and "her to dance" is the object. Additionally, the pronoun "her" correctly agrees with its antecedent and takes on the objective case as required by the verb "want." Therefore, there are no syntactic errors in the sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Jean persuaded Robert" is grammatically correct. The subject "Jean" is the person doing the action, and the verb "persuaded" indicates that the subject has convinced someone to do something. The object "Robert" is the person being acted upon. This structure follows the rules of English syntax for a simple sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Jean wants Bill to do the Macarena" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules for English syntax. In particular, the subject (Jean) is followed by a verb (wants), and there is a clear relationship between the main clause ("Jean wants") and the subordinate clause ("Bill to do the Macarena"). This type of construction is called a "subjunctive mood," where the speaker expresses a desire or a demand rather than stating a fact. Overall, the sentence has no errors in grammar, vocabulary, spelling, or punctuation, so I would rate it as fully correct.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "the children," and the verb is "admire." The object of the verb is "their mother." The word order follows standard English syntax rules for a simple declarative sentence (Subject-Verb-Object). Additionally, the possessive form "their" correctly modifies "mother."
1	Other Category	The sentence "Who has Peter talked with?" is grammatically correct. It is a question asking about the person or people that Peter has spoken to. Therefore, it does not fit into any of the specific error categories (Syntax, Semantics, or Morphology), so I am categorizing it as "Other Category."
1	Other Category	The sentence "Heidi likes her violin" is grammatically correct. Here's a brief explanation for each category: Syntax: This refers to the arrangement of words to create meaningful sentences. In this case, the syntax is correct because we have a subject ("Heidi"), verb ("likes"), and object ("violin"). Semantics: This refers to meaning. The sentence makes sense and has a clear interpretation. Morphology: This refers to how individual words are formed from smaller units called morphemes. Since there are no issues with word formation or inflections here, morphology is fine too.
0	Syntax	The error in this sentence is syntactic because it relates to the structure of the sentence. In particular, the pronoun “himself” does not agree with its antecedent “John.” Since John is masculine singular, the reflexive pronoun should be “himself,” not “herself.” Therefore, a correct version would be: “John thinks that Mary loves him.”
0	Syntax	The possessive form "himself" should be replaced with a regular object pronoun since it's not modifying a verb or adjective in this context. A correct version would be: "Which pictures of him does John like?"
0	Syntax	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in this sentence. In English, singular subjects require a singular verb form. Here, 'Any' is a singular subject and requires a singular verb form such as 'hunts'. However, it is followed by the plural noun phrase 'owls', causing confusion about whether we need a singular or plural verb form. A corrected version could be 'Any owl hunts mice' or 'Owls that are any (particular kind) hunt mice.'
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a negative quantifier "any" but lacks a subsequent negation such as "not." A grammatically correct way to phrase the sentence would be "No man ate dinner," or alternatively, "Any man did not eat dinner."
1	Syntax	The sentence "A pilot could be flying this plane" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "a pilot," which is singular and indefinite. This is followed by a verb phrase in the present conditional tense, "could be flying." The direct object of the sentence is "this plane," which follows the verb phrase. The word order is correct, and there are no grammatical errors or awkward phrasing. Therefore, I would rate this sentence as syntactically correct.
1	Semantics	The sentence is grammatically correct and semantically meaningful. It states that everyone who went to last week's large rally (regardless of their identity) signed a petition. This statement is unambiguous and clear in its meaning. Therefore, there is no mistake in syntax, morphology or other grammatical aspects.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Anybody who attended last week's huge rally signed the petition." is grammatically correct. It has a clear subject ("anybody"), verb ("attended"), and object ("the petition"). Additionally, it uses appropriate prepositions ("of" and "last") and makes logical sense. Therefore, there are no syntax errors in this sentence.
1	Semantics	The sentence "Any tiger has orange fur, marked with black stripes." is grammatically correct but contains a semantic error. It suggests that all tigers share the same set of orange fur with black stripes, whereas in reality each tiger possesses its own unique pattern of stripes on their fur. Therefore, it would be more accurate to say "All tigers have orange fur, typically marked with black stripes" or "Tigers generally have orange fur, distinctively marked with black stripes," indicating that while most tigers exhibit these characteristics, they do so individually.
0	Semantics	The statement "Any albino tiger has orange fur, marked with black stripes" contains a factual error. An albino animal lacks pigmentation due to a genetic mutation, so it cannot have any color other than white or very pale shades. In reality, true albinism does not occur among tigers; however, there is a condition called leucism that can cause similar appearance. Tigers affected by leucism still do not display typical orange and black colors but rather show reduced levels of darker pigments resulting in lighter-colored coats without distinct patterns. Therefore, I must classify this as semantic error because the content itself contradicts what we know about biology and genetics.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a vague pronoun reference. The subject ("you") does not clearly refer to a specific antecedent (a noun or pronoun). It would be clearer if it said "You must pick any flower that you see." This way, there's no confusion about who needs to do the picking.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Any pilot on duty today could be flying this plane" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "any pilot on duty today," which is a noun clause acting as the subject. It is modified by "on duty today" to indicate which pilots we're talking about. "Could be flying" serves as the verb phrase here indicating possibility or uncertainty. This use of modal verbs (could) followed by a present participle form (flying) is common in English for expressing possibilities. Overall, there are no grammatical errors in this sentence, so it falls under syntax since it pertains to word order and structure.
1	Syntax	The sentence "You may pick every flower, but leave a few for Mary." is grammatically correct. It follows standard syntactic rules such as subject-verb agreement and proper word order. Additionally, it contains no spelling or morphological errors.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the rules for subject-verb agreement and word order. The first clause contains the simple past tense verb "beat" followed by two noun phrases as its objects ("the Red Sox" and "by the Giants"). The second clause uses the passive voice but still maintains proper syntax since the auxiliary verb "were" agrees with the plural subject "Dodgers." Additionally, there's a coordinating conjunction "and" connecting both clauses together making them parallel structures.
1	Semantics	The sentence is grammatically correct but it lacks context for a complete semantic interpretation. For example, we don't know who saw the man or where this action took place. However, syntactically, morphologically, and otherwise, there is no issue with the sentence.
1	Syntax	This sentence is syntactically correct because it follows the rules for word order and structure in English. It contains a subject ("the man"), a verb ("computed"), and two objects ("my tax" and "who Mary loves and Sally hates"). The relative clause "who Mary loves and Sally hates" modifies the noun phrase "the man," providing additional information about his identity. Overall, the sentence is grammatically sound and easy to understand.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct. It uses a relative clause ("which Mary made") to provide additional information about the antecedent "the kennel." The verb tenses agree (made vs sleeps), and the meaning is clear. No morphological errors or semantic inconsistencies can be found either.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Tom said he would and Bill actually did eat a raw eggplant" is grammatically correct. It contains two independent clauses ("Tom said he would..." and "Bill actually did eat a raw eggplant") connected by a conjunction ("and"). Each clause has a subject and a verb, which is necessary for syntactic well-formedness. Additionally, there are no spelling or morphological errors in the sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence "The wealthy young man bought that piano for his secret fiancée" is grammatically correct as it follows the rules of English syntax. It has a subject ("the wealthy young man"), a verb ("bought"), and an object ("that piano"). Additionally, there is a prepositional phrase ("for his secret fiancée") that modifies the verb. All these elements are arranged correctly, making the sentence syntactically sound.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct because it follows standard English syntax rules for word order (Subject-Verb-Object): "The dog" (subject) "stole" (verb) "the turkey" (object). All words are used correctly and there are no spelling or grammar errors.
1	Other Category	The sentence "a tall building" is grammatically correct as it contains a determiner ("a"), an adjective ("tall") and a noun ("building"). However, it seems to be missing additional context or information, such as a main verb or object, making it appear incomplete. Nonetheless, based on the provided prompt, I will evaluate its grammaticality only and therefore rate it as correct (label = 1).
1	Other Category	The sentence "This building is tall" is grammatically correct. The subject "this building" is followed by a linking verb "is," and the predicate adjective "tall" describes the subject. Therefore, there are no syntax, semantic, or morphological errors in this sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence "I like the book which you gave me." is grammatically correct. In terms of syntax, it follows the standard structure for a simple declarative sentence (Subject + Verb + Object) and includes a relative clause ("which you gave me") that modifies the object noun phrase. Additionally, all words within the sentence are used correctly according to their part of speech and agreement rules between subject and verb have been observed.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Captain Wentworth wrote a letter to Anne Elliott." is grammatically correct because it follows standard English syntax rules for forming a simple sentence. It contains a subject ("Captain Wentworth"), a verb ("wrote"), and an object ("a letter") as well as a prepositional phrase ("to Anne Elliott") indicating the recipient of the letter. All elements are arranged correctly according to their grammatical function.
0	Syntax	In English, auxiliary (or helping) verbs such as "was" should come before subject nouns in questions. Therefore, the correct form of the sentence would be "She asked **was** she **coming** to the party?" or "Was Alison coming to the party?" but not "She asked was Alison coming to the party." The latter incorrectly places the auxiliary verb after the subject noun.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct. Here's a breakdown of the syntax: * "They" is the subject of the sentence. * "realised" is the past tense of the verb "to realize," indicating that the action occurred in the past. * "that" introduces a subordinate clause. * "never" is used as a negative adverb modifying the verb phrase "had been offended." * "had been offended" is the past perfect tense of the verb "to offend," indicating that the action was completed before another past action (in this case, "they realized"). * "Sir Thomas" is the direct object of the verb phrase "had been offended." * "so" is used as an intensifier, emphasizing the degree to which Sir Thomas was offended. * "offended" is the past participle form of the verb "to offend."
1	Syntax	The sentence "Fanny regretted having to talk to Aunt Norris" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Fanny," who is performing the action of regret. The verb phrase "regretted having to talk" contains the main verb "regretted" as well as the infinitive "to talk." This structure indicates that Fanny has a past regret related to talking to someone, specifically identified here as "Aunt Norris." Overall, the syntax of the sentence follows standard English rules for word order, tense agreement, and subject-verb agreement.
1	Other Category	The sentence "Knowing the country well, he took a short cut" is grammatically correct. It contains a participial phrase ("knowing the country well") that modifies the subject of the main clause ("he"). This construction is often used in written English to add additional information about the subject before the main verb. In spoken English, it might be more common to use a coordinating conjunction (e.g., "He knew the country well, so he took a shortcut.") or a subordinating conjunction (e.g., "Because he knew the country well, he took a shortcut."). However, both constructions are grammatical and convey the same meaning. Therefore, I would classify this as belonging to the "Other Category," since there is no error in syntax, semantics, or morphology.
1	Syntax	The sentence "He left the train with somebody else's wallet in his pocket." is grammatically correct. It follows standard English syntax rules for word order and structure. The subject "he" is followed by a verb "left," and then there are two prepositional phrases "with somebody else's wallet" and "in his pocket" providing additional information about the action.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Magnus went to Ireland" is grammatically correct. The subject "Magnus" agrees with the verb "went," and the preposition "to" takes the object "Ireland." This forms a simple sentence without any syntactic errors.
0	Syntax	The sentence "Who did John send the book?" is grammatically incorrect because it lacks a necessary question word ("who" or "what") before the verb "send." A corrected version could be "Who did John send the book to?" or "What did John send to the person?"
0	Syntax	In this sentence, there is a syntax error because the clause "the Dome was dull" is restrictive (identifying which dome) but it is set off by commas as if it were non-restrictive (adding extra information about the already identified dome). To fix the issue, we can either remove the commas or rephrase the sentence so that "dull" modifies something else. Here's how it could be corrected: * Correct Sentence 1: The idea dismayed the Prime Minister that the dome was dull. * Correct Sentence 2: The idea dismayed the Prime Minister, for he found the Dome to be dull.
0	Syntax	In English, when we use the phrase "X did Y", both X and Y need to be complete phrases or clauses themselves. Here, "he" is not a full clause but rather just a noun phrase, causing the sentence to have incorrect syntax. A corrected version could read "He came right in without so much as a knock."
1	Syntax	The sentence "Harriet admired Mr Knightley" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Harriet," a proper noun. The verb is "admired," a past tense form of the verb "to admire." This indicates that the action took place in the past. The object of the sentence is "Mr Knightley," another proper noun. The sentence has a clear structure (subject + verb + object) and follows all standard rules for English syntax.
1	Other Category	The sentence “The book is boring” is grammatically correct. It consists of a noun phrase (“the book”) functioning as the subject and a verb phrase (“is boring”) functioning as the predicate. Additionally, it contains an adjective (“boring”) modifying the noun (“book”). Therefore, there are no syntactic, semantic, or morphological errors in this sentence.
1	Other Category	The sentence "Ethel wishes to ask you some awkward questions." is grammatically correct. It follows standard English syntax rules for word order and structure. Its meaning (semantics) is clear as well - someone named Ethel wants to ask some uncomfortable questions. Additionally, there do not appear to be any errors related to morphological forms or inflections. Therefore, I would classify this sentence as belonging to the "Other Category" category since it does not fit into the categories of Syntax, Semantics, or Morphology errors.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Emma made Harriet some food" is grammatically correct. In terms of syntax, it follows a typical subject-verb-object (SVO) structure where "Emma" serves as the subject, "made" functions as the verb, and "Harriet some food" acts as the object. Additionally, the use of auxiliary verb "did" or "do" isn't necessary here because the tense is clear from context.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object (SVO) word order in English, where the subject ("the window") comes first, followed by the verb ("was broken"), and then the object ("with a hammer"). Additionally, each word is used appropriately within its context and there are no spelling or morphological errors.
1	Syntax	The sentence "The fugitive lay motionless in order to avoid discovery" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "the fugitive," which is a noun in singular form. The verb "lay" agrees with the subject because it requires a direct object, which is provided by the phrase "motionless." The preposition "in order" introduces the purpose clause "to avoid discovery," where the infinitive verb "avoid" is used correctly. Therefore, there are no syntax errors in this sentence.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject ("the guard") is performing the action denoted by the verb ("marched"), and the direct object ("the prisoners") is receiving the action. Additionally, there is a prepositional phrase ("round the yard") modifying the verb, specifying where the action occurred. Overall, this sentence exhibits proper syntactic structure.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Frank Churchill crossed the street" is grammatically correct. It follows standard English syntax rules for word order (subject-verb-object) and contains no grammatical or spelling errors. Therefore, it is a valid English sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Emma and Harriet were attacked yesterday" is grammatically correct. It follows standard subject-verb-object word order, and uses proper tense agreement ("were attacked" indicates past tense). Additionally, it utilizes a coordinating conjunction ("and") to connect two nouns ("Emma" and "Harriet"). Therefore, there are no syntax errors present in this sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Fiona might be here by 5 o'clock." is grammatically correct. Here, "might" is a modal verb expressing possibility, followed by the subject "Fiona," and then the base form of the verb "be." The phrase "by 5 o'clock" functions as an adverbial of time indicating when Fiona could arrive. Therefore, there are no syntax errors or other issues related to morphology, semantics, or any other category.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct. It contains two independent clauses connected by the coordinating conjunction "and." Each clause has its own subject ("I") and verb ("am expecting" and "is"), so no comma is needed before "and."
1	Semantics	The sentence “Pat was awarded the Golden Fleece Award and very upset about it” is grammatically correct but semantically odd because being awarded an award is usually a positive event, so someone being “very upset” about receiving an award would be unexpected. However, without additional context or information about the nature of the award, it’s difficult to say for sure whether the sentence is incorrect or just unusual. Nonetheless, I will give it a label of 1 since there are no grammatical errors in the sentence.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a syntactic error because it uses the present participle "beating" without a clear subject or auxiliary verb. A possible correction could be "Kim alienated the cats and beat his dog," assuming that both actions have the same subject (Kim). Alternatively, if two different subjects are intended for each action, then they must be expressed clearly by rewriting the sentence as follows: "Kim alienated the cats and he was beating his dog."
1	Syntax	The sentence "They knew that pictures of each other would be on sale" is grammatically correct. The subject "they" agrees with the verb "knew." The clause "that pictures of each other would be on sale" correctly functions as the direct object of the sentence. Additionally, the reflexive pronoun "each other" is appropriately used to indicate reciprocal action between two or more people. Therefore, there are no syntax errors in this sentence.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a pronoun "which" that refers back to an unspecified noun. This type of construction is called a "referential ambiguity." A more clear way to phrase the question would be: "Which articles did Terry fail to read before filing?" or "Terry filed some papers without reading them; which ones was he supposed to read first?"
1	Other Category	The sentence "I want to try and buy some whisky" is grammatically correct. The verb "try" can be followed by a gerund (verb+ing) or an infinitive (to+base form). In this case, both forms are possible but they convey slightly different meanings. Using the gerund ("try buying") implies attempting the action as a whole, while using the infinitive ("try to buy") emphasizes making an effort to do something new or difficult for the first time. Since the speaker wants to experience buying whisky, it's more appropriate to use the infinitive here, so the corrected version would be "I want to try to buy some whisky." However, since there was only a minor issue regarding meaning rather than grammaticality, the overall score remains 1.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a syntactic error where two verb phrases ("goes" and "buying") are incorrectly connected without using appropriate conjunctions or punctuation marks. A corrected version could be either "She goes and buys some whiskey," or "She goes to buy some whiskey."
0	Syntax	In the given sentence, "Kim and Terry" is a plural noun phrase referring to two people. The verb that follows it must therefore be in its plural form "are". So, the correct version of the sentence would be "Kim and Terry are happy."
1	Syntax	The sentence "Kim gave a dollar to Bobbie and a dime to Jean." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules for syntax in English. Specifically, the sentence has two independent clauses ("Kim gave a dollar to Bobbie" and "a dime to Jean") joined by a coordinating conjunction ("and"). Each clause contains a subject ("Kim," "a dime") and a verb ("gave"), making them both complete thoughts. Additionally, the objects of the verbs ("a dollar," "Bobbie," "Jean") follow proper prepositional phrases, making the overall structure clear and coherent.
1	Syntactic Ambiguity	The sentence is grammatically correct but syntactically ambiguous because it's unclear whether "and on your desk" modifies only "a picture of Bill," or both "put a picture of Bill" and "in the mailbox." However, since there is no actual error in grammar or usage, I would still classify this as correct for practical purposes.
1	Syntax	The sentence appears to be grammatically correct, both semantically and syntactically. However, it contains some repetitive elements. A more concise version could be: "Have this girl in the red coat put a picture of Bill on your desk before tomorrow." Or, if the intention is simply for the action to occur, then "This girl in the red coat will put a picture of Bill on your desk before tomorrow" would suffice. Nonetheless, no clear grammatical or semantic errors can be identified in the original sentence.
1	Other Category	The sentence appears grammatically correct, but it could be clearer. I would suggest changing "this girl in the red coat" to "the girl wearing the red coat," as the phrase "in the red coat" implies she herself is red rather than clarifying what she's wearing. Additionally, stating "a picture of Bill" twice might confuse some readers; consider revising for clarity. Here's my suggested revision: Revised Sentence: "The girl wearing the red coat will place Bill's picture on your desk before tomorrow."
1	Syntax	The sentence "Ann bought a first edition of Richard III for $1000." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a simple sentence, consisting of a subject ("Ann"), a verb ("bought"), and an object ("a first edition of Richard III"). Additionally, the prepositional phrase "for $1000" modifies the verb "bought," indicating the price paid for the item. Therefore, there are no syntax errors in this sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence "John became deadly afraid of flying" is grammatically correct. In this sentence, the verb "became" is used in the past tense, indicating a change in state for the subject "John". The adjective "deadly" modifies the noun phrase "afraid of flying", providing more information about the degree or type of fear that John experienced. This construction is syntactically sound because it follows standard rules regarding word order, tense agreement, and proper use of adjectives.
1	Syntax	The sentence "What John promised is to be gentle." is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "what" functions as a relative pronoun, introducing a clause ("what John promised") that modifies "is." * "John promised" is a verb phrase in the simple past tense, consisting of the subject "John" and the predicate "promised." * "to be gentle" is an infinitive phrase acting as the complement of the linking verb "is," describing what was promised by John. Therefore, the syntax of this sentence is well-formed and it falls under the category of Syntax.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a missing article before the word "books." A more grammatically correct version would be "Henri wants to buy which **book**s about cooking?" or "Henri wants to buy which book about cooking **types**?" depending on whether Henri intends to purchase multiple types of cookbooks or just one type.
1	Syntax	The sentence "I will fix the computer for Carol" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * The subject "I" agrees with the verb "will fix." * The verb "fix" takes the auxiliary verb "will," indicating future tense. * The definite article "the" correctly precedes the noun "computer." * The preposition "for" introduces the prepositional phrase "for Carol," which modifies the verb "fix" appropriately. Overall, there are no syntax errors in this sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Smith loaned a valuable collection of manuscripts to the library" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Smith," who is performing the action of "loaning." The direct object of the verb is "a valuable collection of manuscripts," which is what is being loaned. Finally, "to the library" indicates the indirect object or recipient of the action. This sentence exhibits proper syntax by following standard rules for word order, phrasing, and punctuation.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct, as it follows standard English syntax rules for subject-verb-object word order (Mary - cuts - the paper).
1	Syntax	The sentence "It was from six to nine or it took place from six to nine" is grammatically correct. Both clauses "it was from six to nine" and "it took place from six to nine" are syntactically well-formed. However, there seems to be some confusion regarding whether the event started at six and ended before nine (as suggested by the first clause) or if the event covered the entire duration between six and nine (as implied by the second clause). To clarify the intended meaning, I suggest rephrasing the sentence as follows: * Either "The event occurred from six to nine." or "The event began at six and lasted until nine."
1	Syntax	The sentence "Suddenly, there arrived two inspectors from the INS." is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "Suddenly" sets the scene for the action that follows. It modifies the verb phrase "there arrived two inspectors from the INS," indicating when they arrived. * "There arrived" is a grammatical construction known as existential "there" or presentational "there". This structure is often used to introduce new entities into a discourse. In this case, it emphasizes the arrival of the inspectors. * "Two inspectors" is a plural noun phrase referring to more than one person. Its number agrees with the third-person plural subject pronoun "they", implied by the form of the verb "arrived". * "From the INS" specifies where the inspectors came from, providing additional information about them. Overall, the syntax of this sentence is well-formed and clear, making it grammatically correct.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the rules for subject-verb agreement (the singular subject "soup" matches with the verb "cooks") and includes a coordinating conjunction ("and") connecting two verb phrases ("cooks," "thickens"). Both verbs describe actions that can be performed by the same subject, making the connection logical. Additionally, there is no ambiguity or incorrect meaning conveyed, so semantic issues do not arise here. Morphological errors such as misspellings, incorrect word forms, etc., are also absent. Therefore, this example falls under the category of syntax since all grammatical components work together coherently.
1	Syntax	The sentence "I gave money to the charity" is grammatically correct. The subject "I" is followed by a verb "gave", and then there is an object "money". Also, we have the preposition "to" followed by the recipient "the charity". This structure follows the rules of syntax for English sentences.
1	Other Category	The sentence "John asked." is grammatically correct. It consists of a proper noun "John" as the subject and the verb "asked". Since there is no object or complement following the verb, it implies that the action of asking was performed without any specific purpose or question, but the grammatical structure itself is still valid.
0	Semantics	The sentence "I saw even the student" is semantically incorrect because the word "even" is used incorrectly. In English, "even" is typically used before a specific noun or pronoun to emphasize its unexpectedness or insignificance. Therefore, it would be more appropriate to say something like "I even saw the student," indicating that seeing the student was surprising or notable.
0	Syntax	This sentence is syntactically incorrect because there is no conjunction or punctuation connecting the two independent clauses "John whispered" and "Mary left." To fix this error, a coordinating conjunction (e.g., "and"), semicolon, or period can be added. The corrected sentences could read as follows: "John whispered and Mary left," "John whispered; Mary left," or "John whispered. Mary left."
0	Syntax	The sentence "Mary wonders that Bill will come" contains a syntax error because it uses the subordinating conjunction "that" after the verb "wonders," which requires a clause as its complement. However, the resulting clause "that Bill will come" functions more like a noun phrase than a full clause, leading to awkwardness or confusion for some speakers. A clearer way to express this idea would be using a dependent clause such as "whether": "Mary wonders whether Bill will come." Alternatively, if we want to keep the original formulation without changing it too much, we could use a relative pronoun instead: "Mary wonders about Bill's coming." Both versions convey the intended meaning while avoiding syntactic ambiguity.
0	Syntax	The sentence "Sophie will theater" is grammatically incorrect because it lacks a proper verb. It seems as though there might be a word missing from the infinitive phrase "will theater." A corrected version could be "Sophie will go to the theater," or something similar.
1	Syntax	The sentence "John finished the cake and drank the lemonade" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules for subject-verb agreement, word order, and parallel structure. In this case, there are two independent clauses ("John finished the cake" and "drank the lemonade") joined by a coordinating conjunction ("and"). Each clause has a clear subject (John, the implied subject in the second clause) and verb phrase (finished, drank), making the syntax of the sentence unproblematic.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Herself likes Mary's mother" is grammatically correct. Here, "herself" is a reflexive pronoun used as the subject of the sentence, while "Mary's mother" is the object. Although it may sound strange or unnatural due to pragmatic reasons (since people usually don't refer to themselves using reflexive pronouns when talking about liking someone else), there is no grammatical mistake in this sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Each of the boys fought with some of the other boys" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "Each" functions as a determiner that refers to every individual member of a group. In this case, it indicates that we are talking about each boy individually. * "Of the boys" is a prepositional phrase acting as an adjectival modifier for "each," specifying which particular set of boys we are referring to. * "Fought" is the past tense of the verb "fight." It agrees with the plural subject "boys." * "With" introduces the preposition indicating how or by what means the action was performed. * "Some of the other boys" acts as another adverbial modifier specifying who the boys fought against. "Other" distinguishes these boys from those already mentioned earlier (i.e., the first part of the sentence).
0	Syntax	The error in this sentence is syntactic because it has incorrect subject-verb agreement. In the sentence "John's mother likes himself," the verb "likes" does not agree with its subject "John's mother." Since "mother" is singular, the appropriate form of the verb would be "like." Additionally, "himself" is the wrong reflexive pronoun; it should be "her" instead since the subject is feminine. A corrected version of the sentence could read as follows: "John's mother likes her."
0	Syntax	The subject of the sentence "Mary" is a female name, but the reflexive pronoun used in the object position "himself" indicates a male. In English, we use different reflexive pronouns depending on the gender (and number) of the subject. For example, if the subject is feminine singular, then the corresponding reflexive pronoun must be "herself." Therefore, the grammatically correct form would be "Mary revealed herself to John."
1	Syntax	The sentence "Mary believes that Bill saw himself" is grammatically correct. In terms of syntax, it follows the rules for word order and structure in English. The subject ("Mary") comes before the verb ("believes"), and the dependent clause ("that Bill saw himself") contains its own subject ("Bill") and verb ("saw"). Additionally, the reflexive pronoun ("himself") correctly refers back to the subject of the dependent clause.
1	Syntax	The sentence "John heard that they criticized themselves" is grammatically correct. In terms of syntax, it follows the rules for word order and structure in English. The subject "John" comes before the verb "heard," indicating that John is performing the action of hearing. The clause "that they criticized themselves" functions as the direct object of the sentence, providing additional information about what John heard. Overall, there are no errors in the syntactic structure of this sentence.
1	Other Category	The sentence "Mary thinks that she is smart" is grammatically correct. It has a subject ("Mary"), a verb ("thinks") and an object clause ("she is smart"). All words are used correctly and there are no spelling or punctuation errors. Therefore, it falls under the category of 'Other' as it does not contain any syntax, semantic or morphological error.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Henry found that Bill is sad" is grammatically correct. In terms of syntax, it follows standard English sentence structure (Subject-Verb-Object). Here, "Henry" is the subject, "found" is the verb, and the clause "that Bill is sad" serves as a noun clause acting as the object of the sentence. Additionally, the verb tense is consistent throughout the sentence; both "found" and "is" indicate past tense.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a reflexive error. In English, when using the verb "consider" followed by "himself" or "herself," it implies that the subject is both considering themselves as well as being the object of consideration. However, in this case, we want to indicate that John is proud of Mary, so the reflexive pronoun isn't appropriate here. To fix this issue, replace "himself" with "to be." A corrected version would read: "John considers himself *to be* proud of Mary." Alternatively, if what was intended was for John to take pride in his own accomplishments related to Mary, then rephrase the sentence accordingly (e.g., "John takes pride in his relationship with Mary").
0	Syntax	The correct word order for this sentence should be "You should sit there before." In its current form, the sentence has incorrect syntax because it places "before" after the subject it modifies ("there"). This can lead to confusion as to what the sentence actually means.
1	Syntax	The sentence "There is a nurse available" is grammatically correct. The subject-verb agreement is correct as "is" agrees with its singular subject "a nurse". Also, there are no obvious errors in word choice or formation, making it syntactically sound.
0	Semantics	The sentence "Everyone hopes everyone to sleep" has a semantic error. In this context, we would typically say "everyone hopes that everyone else will sleep." The issue lies in the verb form following "hopes". We hope for something (a noun or pronoun), but here it appears as if people are hoping others directly. Therefore, using the subordinating conjunction "that" before the infinitive phrase "everyone else sleeps" can make the meaning clearer.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Everyone hopes that he will sleep" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "Everyone" is a singular pronoun that refers to a group or class of people. It requires a singular verb form such as "hopes." In this case, "hopes" agrees with its subject "everyone," so there is no error in number agreement between them. * The subordinating conjunction "that" introduces a clause ("that he will sleep") after the main clause ("Everyone hopes"). This construction creates a complex sentence structure. * The relative pronoun "he" refers back to an antecedent (the implied person who is doing the sleeping), making it clear whom we hope will sleep. * Finally, the future tense marker "will" indicates that the action of sleeping has not yet occurred but is expected to happen sometime in the future. Overall, the syntax of this sentence follows standard rules for forming complex sentences in English.
0	Semantics	The sentence contains a semantic error related to coreference resolution. Specifically, there are two instances of "Churchill" referring to the same person, but they cannot both be the giver and receiver of the Blood, Sweat and Tears speech. A corrected version could be: "Only Churchill recalled (or 'thought about') Churchill giving the Blood, Sweat and Tears speech."
0	Syntax	The error in this sentence is related to syntax, specifically verb agreement and pronoun reference. In the phrase "promise Mary to shave himself," there's a mismatch between the singular subject (John) and the plural form of the verb (promise). Additionally, it is incorrect for someone to say they will "shave himself." It must be "shave himself" if referring to a male or "shave herself" if referring to a female. So, a grammatically correct version would be: "John promised Mary he would shave himself."
1	Syntax	The sentence "John convinced Bill that Mary should sleep" is grammatically correct. In terms of syntax, it follows the standard structure of a sentence, consisting of a subject ("John"), a verb ("convinced"), and an object ("Bill"). Additionally, there is a subordinate clause ("that Mary should sleep") that provides further information about what John convinced Bill of. This clause has its own subject-verb-object structure as well. Overall, all elements of the sentence work together cohesively without any grammatical errors or awkward phrasing, making it syntactically sound.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a syntactic error known as a run-on or fused sentence. This occurs when two independent clauses (i.e., complete thoughts) are joined without proper punctuation or conjunction. In this case, there's no coordinating conjunction linking "I saw Bill" and "you did so Mary." To fix it, we can add a semicolon, comma + conjunction, or convert them into separate sentences. Here are three corrected versions: 1. I saw Bill; while you did so, Mary ate lunch. 2. I saw Bill, whereas you chose to ignore him during Mary's lunch. 3. I saw Bill. While you did so, Mary was eating lunch.
0	Syntax	The verb "give" requires both a direct object (the thing being given) and an indirect object (the recipient). In this sentence, "a book" is correctly identified as the direct object, but there is no preposition introducing the indirect object. A correct version might be "What Mary did was give a book to Bill." Alternatively, if we want to use the word order of the original sentence, it could be rewritten as "Bill's receiving a book from Mary is what she did."
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct. It consists of a noun phrase ("the bears") followed by a verb phrase ("sniffed"). Both subject-verb agreement and word order rules are satisfied.
1	Syntactic Ambiguity Resolution	The sentence "to steal talismans from witches is dangerous" is grammatically correct but syntactically ambiguous because it can be interpreted in two ways depending on whether "from witches" modifies "steal" or "dangerous." In order to resolve the ambiguity, we need additional context or information. However, as a standalone sentence without further clarification, I will assume it means stealing talismans from anyone (not just witches) is dangerous since there's no clear reason for singling out witches otherwise.
0	Syntax	The sentence "Anson demonized" is grammatically incorrect because it lacks a complete thought or predicate. A noun (in this case, "Anson") needs a verb to make sense in a sentence. Additionally, there's no clear antecedent for "Anson," so we don't know who or what "Anson" refers to without additional context.
0	Syntax	The verb "kick" requires a singular object when used reflexively (i.e., oneself), but here it is used with a plural reflexive pronoun ("yourselves"). This creates a mismatch between the subject and the object, making the sentence syntactically incorrect. A grammatically correct version would be "you kicked yourself."
0	Syntax	This sentence contains a misplaced relative clause. A relative clause headed by the word “that” needs to be immediately after the noun it modifies (in this case, “book”). Here’s how the corrected version would look: “The book that I said I’d never read.” or “The book I said I’d never read.” Both versions are grammatically correct; however, using commas around the relative clause creates a non-restrictive meaning, implying there is only one book being discussed, whereas leaving out the commas implies there could be more than one book the speaker has never read.
0	Syntax	The verb "demonize" requires a direct object, but there is no noun or pronoun after it for it to act upon. Additionally, the adverb "up" does not make sense in this context. A corrected version could be "Anson demonized the Khyber Pass."
1	Semantics	The sentence "It is not true that I might be going to the party" is grammatically correct. The negation "not" modifies the noun phrase "true," indicating a negative statement about the possibility of attending the party. This type of construction falls under semantics, as it concerns the meaning and truth value of language rather than its form or structure (syntax), word formation (morphology), or other aspects related to usage or context.
0	Syntax	The sentence "Kick you!" is syntactically incorrect because it lacks a subject. In English, every complete sentence must have a subject (the person or thing doing the action) and a predicate (the verb describing the action). A corrected version could be "He kicks you" or "I will kick you."
1	Syntax	The sentence "Jason persuaded the doctor to treat Medea" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules for English syntax. In particular, each clause contains a subject ("Jason," "the doctor") and a verb ("persuaded," "to treat"), and there is a clear relationship between the two clauses established by the conjunction "to." Additionally, the word order is correct, with subjects preceding verbs and objects following verbs. Overall, the sentence exhibits proper syntactic structure and does not contain any errors.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a misplaced modifier. The phrase "of you" is modifying the verb "get," but it should be modifying the noun that comes before it. A corrected version would be: "Who did you get an accurate description of?" or "Of whom did you get an accurate description?"
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct. The noun phrase "The Peter" functions as the subject, followed by the verb "was," and the prepositional phrase "at the party" provides additional information about where "Peter" was located. Additionally, there is no ambiguity or incorrect meaning (semantic error), and the words themselves do not have any errors in their internal structure (morphological error).
1	Syntax	The sentence "The government's imposition of a fine" is grammatically correct. Here, "government" is a noun serving as the possessor of the gerund verb phrase "imposition of a fine." A gerund is a verbal form ending in "-ing," which functions as a noun within a sentence. In this case, it heads the noun phrase "the imposition of a fine." No syntax errors can be found in this sentence.
1	Semantics	The sentence "Did Athena help us?" is grammatically correct. The auxiliary verb "did" is used correctly to form a question, and the subject-verb agreement is correct as well ("Athena," singular, agrees with "help," also singular). In terms of meaning or semantics, there is no ambiguity or incorrect usage either.
1	Syntax	The sentence "You wanted to meet the man I saw" is grammatically correct. The subject-verb agreement is maintained throughout the sentence (you-wanted, man-saw). Additionally, there are no missing or extra words, and the word order follows standard English syntax rules. Therefore, it falls under the category of Syntax as it does not contain any errors related to sentence structure.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Anson demonized David every day" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "Anson" is a proper noun functioning as the subject of the sentence. It is correctly capitalized. * "demonized" is the past tense of the verb "demonize," indicating what action was taken by the subject towards the object. * "David" is a proper noun functioning as the direct object of the sentence. It follows the transitive verb "demonized." * "every day" functions as an adverbial phrase modifying the verb "demonized." It indicates how often the action occurred. The syntax is clear and concise, making it easy for readers to understand who did what to whom and when it happened.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a spelling mistake. It should be "there is a program" instead of "there is a programme". In American English, it's acceptable to use "programme", but in British English, it should be "program". However, since the question specifies Radio 4 (a British radio station), using "programme" would still be incorrect for this context.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Medea denied poisoning the phoenix" is grammatically correct. The subject "Medea" agrees with the verb "denied," and the object "the phoenix" follows the correct structure for an English sentence (Subject-Verb-Object). Additionally, there are no misspelled words or incorrect word choices, so it does not fall under morphology or semantics errors. Therefore, I would classify this as a syntax error, but since it's actually correct, I will return 1 instead of 0.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of subject-verb-object (SVO) in English. The subject ("the elixir") is clearly identified, followed by the verb ("was hidden"), and finally the object of the preposition ("in a hole in the ground"). Additionally, there are no spelling or morphological errors present in the sentence.
0	Syntax	The sentence "Extremely frantically, Anson danced at Trade" contains a syntactic error because the preposition "at" is used incorrectly. It seems that the intended meaning of the sentence is that Anson was dancing at a place called "Trade," but the correct way to express this would be "Anson danced extremly frantically at Trade." Alternatively, if "Trade" is being used as a verb (e.g., referring to trading goods), then the sentence might need to be restructured entirely. In any case, the current formulation of the sentence is unclear and grammatically incorrect.
0	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically incorrect because it contains a dangling participle ("asking") and lacks proper subjects for both clauses. A corrected version could be: "What (or whom) did Medea ask when she gave (the gift)?" This makes clear that there was a question being asked by Medea at some point before or after giving something away.
1	Syntax	The sentence "It's Anson that I like" is grammatically correct. In this sentence, "it's" is a contraction for "it is," and it serves as the subject of the sentence. "Anson" is the noun phrase that follows the linking verb "is." Finally, "that I like" is a relative clause modifying "Anson." Therefore, there are no syntax errors in this sentence.
0	Syntax	The verb "tried" needs to be followed by a base form of the verb (in this case, "to poison" should be just "poison"). Also, there's no preposition needed between "tried" and "the nurse". A correct version would be "Medea tried to poison her children" or "Medea attempted to have the nurse poison her children."
0	Semantics	The sentence contains a semantic error. It should be either "I feel that I knew you" or "I feel as though I know you". The first option implies past knowledge of the person while the second suggests present familiarity but uncertainty about it. As written, "I felt that I know you", the tense agreement between the verb tenses is inconsistent, making the meaning unclear.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a double subject ("he" and "can") which is grammatically incorrect in standard English. A corrected version could be "Will he be able to do it?" or "Can he do it?"
0	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically incorrect due to a problem with subject-verb agreement. The verb "ate" does not agree with its plural subject "I." Additionally, there is no clear relationship between the action described by the verb (eating) and the information about someone being happy. A possible corrected version could be "I knew that she was happy," but without further context it's difficult to say for sure what the intended meaning might have been.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Anson believed himself to be handsome" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * The subject of the sentence is "Anson," a proper noun. Proper nouns always start with a capital letter. * The verb phrase is "believed himself to be." This consists of the past tense of the linking verb "to believe," followed by the reflexive pronoun "himself," and another infinitive verb phrase "to be." Linking verbs connect the subject to additional information about the subject (in this case, "handsome"). Reflexive pronouns refer back to the subject and indicate that the subject is performing the action on itself. Both of these grammatical concepts are being used correctly here. * Finally, the adjective "handsome" modifies the implied subject ("he") of the second verb phrase. It provides descriptive information about the person who is doing the believing. Adjectives modify nouns or pronouns and can appear before them (as in "a happy child") or after linking verbs (as in "the child seems happy"). In this case, it appears after a linking verb as expected.
1	Syntax	The sentence "We arrived about six o'clock" is grammatically correct. In this sentence, "about" functions as an adverb modifying the verb phrase "arrived," indicating approximately when the action occurred (around six o'clock). The syntax structure follows standard English conventions without any errors or inconsistencies.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a past perfect verb tense error. It should be either "Gilgamesh has fought the dragon" (present perfect) or "Gilgamesh had fought the dragon" (past perfect). In its current form, it incorrectly combines present tense ("is") with the past participle form of the verb ("fought").
0	Syntax	The reflexive pronoun "himself" cannot be used as a subject; it can only be used as an object or an oblique (i.e., after a preposition). In this case, the subject of the sentence is "Anson," so we need a regular personal pronoun ("he") instead of a reflexive pronoun. Therefore, the corrected sentence would read: "Anson thought that he was happy."
1	Semantics	The sentence "Fortunately Hermione passed biology" is grammatically correct and has a clear meaning. Therefore, it does not have any syntax or morphological errors. In terms of semantics, the word "fortunately" indicates a positive outcome related to the event of passing biology, so there are no issues with the intended meaning of the sentence.
1	Semantics	The sentence "I might be not going to the party but washing my hair" is grammatically correct, but it contains a redundancy in negation which can lead to confusion or misunderstanding. A clearer way to express the idea would be "I might go to the party or just wash my hair instead." However, there's no fundamental grammatical error, so we can still consider it as semantically acceptable even if not optimal.
0	Syntax	The reflexive pronoun used after a verb must be in accordance with the subject's number and gender. In this case, the subject is 'he', so the reflexive pronoun should be 'himself'. Therefore, the correct form would be 'I thought he liked himself.'
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct because it follows standard English syntax rules for word order (subject-verb-object). In this case, the subject ("the butler") performs the action denoted by the verb ("sent"), and the object ("the poison") receives the action. Additionally, the prepositional phrase "to Dinah" modifies the verb and clarifies who received the poison.
0	Semantics	The sentence contains redundancy and ambiguity due to multiple uses of modal verbs (happens, seems) and the phrase "to be" used after each other. It can be rewritten as "Jason appears sick," implying he looks unwell without unnecessary repetition or confusion about his actual condition.
0	Semantics	The sentence is grammatically incorrect because it contains a misplaced question word ("who"). A more appropriate way to phrase the question would be "What did you see?" or "Who did you ask?" It's unclear what is being asked in the original sentence, as both subjects (you and who) cannot logically refer to the same entity. This makes the meaning of the sentence ambiguous, hence the semantic error.
1	Syntax	The sentence "We linguists love to argue" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "We" is a pronoun used as the subject of the sentence. It agrees with its plural verb "love." * "Linguists" is a noun that refers to people who specialize in linguistics. In this case, it serves as an appositive, providing additional information about the subject "we." An appositive must be set off by commas or parentheses if it comes after the word it modifies, but no punctuation marks are needed here because "linguists" directly follows the subject without any intervening words. * "Love" is a verb indicating affection or fondness for something (in this case, arguing). As I mentioned earlier, it agrees with its singular subject "we." * Finally, "to argue" is an infinitive phrase functioning as the direct object of the sentence. Infinitives consist of the particle "to" followed by a base form of a verb, so "argue" fits perfectly well in this context.
0	Syntax	The sentence "He can will go" is grammatically incorrect because it uses two auxiliary verbs ("can" and "will") together, which is unnecessary and redundant. In English, we typically use only one auxiliary verb per clause to express tense, aspect, or modality. A correct version of this sentence could be "He can go" (to indicate ability) or "He will go" (to indicate future intention), but not both.
0	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically incorrect because it lacks a proper question word (who, what, where, when, why, how) at the beginning of the sentence to form a grammatically complete interrogative statement. A corrected version could be "How fierce was the battle?" or "How fierce is the battle?" depending on context.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a syntactic error known as a question fragment. A question should have both an auxiliary verb (in this case, "did") and a subject ("you"). However, there are two instances of "which" but no noun or pronoun for them to modify or refer to. To fix this, we could rephrase it as follows: "Which king did you ask about; which city did he invade?" This way, each instance of "which" has a clear antecedent and can function properly within its clause.
0	Syntax	The subject of the sentence, "it," does not agree with its verb, "are." In addition, there is a missing article before "disgruntled old pigs" making it ungrammatical. A corrected version could be: "There are some disgruntled old pigs in those ditches that humans love to eat." However, even if syntactically corrected, the content would still raise ethical concerns as well as potential semantic ambiguity (which part of the pig do humans love to eat?).
0	Syntax	In the sentence "That banana is eating the monkey," there is a subject-verb agreement error. The plural noun "bananas" requires a plural verb such as "are." However, the singular form of the verb "is" was used instead. Additionally, it is semantically incorrect for a banana to eat a monkey since bananas do not have the ability to consume food or prey on other animals.
0	Syntax	The sentence "Burn them!" is a fragment because it lacks a main verb and a subject, making it syntactically incorrect. A complete sentence requires both elements for clarity and proper meaning conveyance.
1	Semantics	The sentence is grammatically correct but semantically odd because it expresses a negative evaluation ("it stinks") towards a mythological figure (Aphrodite) who has no control over real-world events. However, there's nothing inherently incorrect about saying "Aphrodite is omnipotent" as it follows proper syntactic rules for subject-verb agreement and word order, so I will rate it as correct overall.
1	Semantics	The sentence "Agamemnon seems to be a maniac" is grammatically correct. In terms of semantics, it can be understood and conveys a clear meaning. Here, "Agamemnon" refers to a specific individual (in Greek mythology), while "maniac" describes his state of mind or behavior. Therefore, there is no error in this sentence from a semantic perspective.
1	Other Category	The sentence “Will Anson come to the party?” is grammatically correct. It has a subject (“Anson”), an auxiliary verb (“will”) indicating future tense, and an infinitive verb phrase (“come”). Additionally, it contains a prepositional phrase (“to the party”) acting as the destination for the action described by the main verb. Overall, there are no syntax, morphological, or semantic errors present in this sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence "I wondered who Medea had poisoned" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "I wondered" is a correct construction for expressing curiosity or doubt about something that happened in the past. It requires a subject ("I") and a verb ("wondered"). * "who" serves as the subject of the relative clause "who Medea had poisoned". Relative clauses modify noun phrases (in this case, the implied phrase would be "the person(s)"), and they typically begin with a relative pronoun such as "who", "which", or "that". * "Medea" is a proper noun referring to a character from Greek mythology known for her vengeful acts against those who wronged her. * "had poisoned" is the past perfect tense of the verb "to poison". This tense indicates that an action was completed before another past action took place. In this context, it implies that whoever Medea poisoned died or suffered harm prior to the speaker's wondering. Overall, there are no grammatical errors or ambiguities in the sentence, so it falls into the category of syntax.
1	Syntax	The sentence "I inquired when could we leave" is grammatically correct but has a slight issue with word choice. Instead of using "when," it would be more appropriate to use "at what time." So a better way to say it would be "I inquired at what time we could leave." However, since the question asks for whether the sentence is correct or incorrect without changing anything, I will still give it a score of 1 because all the grammatical components such as subject-verb agreement, tense consistency, etc., are intact.
0	Syntax	The sentence is missing a direct object after the verb "kicked." A more complete version of the sentence could be "They kicked the ball," but as it stands, there is no clear indication of what was being kicked. This makes the syntax of the sentence unclear and grammatically incorrect.
0	Syntax	In the sentence "The monkey is ate the banana," the verb "is" does not agree with its subject "monkey." Instead, it requires the past tense form "ate," so a grammatically correct version would be "The monkey ate the banana." This error relates to syntax because word order and agreement between words (in this case, subject-verb agreement) fall under syntactic rules.
0	Syntax	The verb tense is incorrect in the sentence. In the present tense, we use "can" instead of "could" for ability. Additionally, there is a spelling mistake in "I would like to **c**ould swim." It should be "I would like to **c**an swim." So the corrected version of the sentence is "I would like to can swim," but it's more natural to say "I would like to be able to swim."
1	Syntax	The sentence "I kicked myself" is grammatically correct. In this sentence, the subject is "I", the verb is "kicked", and the object is "myself". This structure follows the rules of English syntax. Additionally, all words used in this sentence are correctly formed (morphology) and have a clear meaning (semantics). Therefore, there are no errors in the sentence.
0	Syntax	In this sentence, "bookcase" is a noun and cannot serve as the subject of a verb because it is an inanimate object. Only living beings or animated objects can perform actions denoted by verbs. Therefore, using "ran," which denotes motion or action, with "bookcase" results in a syntactical error. A more appropriate word choice for the subject would be something like "the man" or even "the bookcase when it fell."
1	Syntax	The sentence "I shaved myself" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "I", a pronoun in the first person singular. The verb of the sentence is "shaved", a past tense form of the verb "shave". The object of the sentence is "myself", a reflexive pronoun that refers back to the subject "I". This type of construction where the subject performs an action on itself is called a reflexive verb phrase, which is syntactically correct.
0	Morphology	The phrase "muscle bound" is incorrect because it lacks a determiner such as "a" or "the." A corrected version would be "Anson became a muscle-bound person," or something similar depending on context.
