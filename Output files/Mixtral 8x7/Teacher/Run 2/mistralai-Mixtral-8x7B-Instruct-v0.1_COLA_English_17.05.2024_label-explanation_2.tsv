label	explanation
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It contains a simple subject ("the sailors"), a verb that agrees with the subject ("rode"), and an object ("the breeze"). Additionally, it includes a prepositional phrase that modifies the verb ("clear of the rocks"). All elements are arranged in a logical order, making the sentence easy to understand.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. Here's a breakdown of the structure: * Subject: The weights (simple subject) * Verb: made (linking verb connecting the subject to its complement) * Complement: stretched (predicate nominative specifying what the subject became or did) * Prepositional phrase: over the pulley (modifies where the action took place)
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "The mechanical doll" is a noun phrase that serves as the subject of the sentence. It consists of the definite article "the," followed by the adjective "mechanical" describing the noun "doll." * "wriggle" is a verb that means to move with short twisting or turning movements. In this context, it indicates that the doll managed to free itself from something that was holding it back. * "itself" is a reflexive pronoun referring to the subject of the sentence (the mechanical doll). Reflexive pronouns indicate that the action performed by the subject affects the same entity. * Therefore, the sentence "The mechanical doll wriggled itself loose" implies that the mechanical doll freed itself using its own movements.
1	The sentence "If you had eaten more, you would want less" is grammatically correct. It follows the standard structure of a conditional sentence type II (also known as second conditional), which expresses hypothetical or unlikely situations using the past perfect tense ("had eaten") for the if-clause and the modal verb "would" followed by the base form of the main verb ("want") for the main clause. Both clauses have their subjects placed before verbs, making it unambiguously clear who is performing each action. Overall, there are no grammatical errors in this sentence.
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect because of the word order in the second part of the sentence. A more appropriate way to phrase it would be: "The less you want, the more you eat." This version follows standard subject-verb agreement rules, which require that a singular verb ("want") agree with its singular subject ("you"), while a plural verb ("eat") agrees with its plural subject ("you"). Additionally, using "the" before both adjectives creates parallel structure, improving overall coherence.
0	This sentence is grammatically incorrect due to the use of a double negative ("the more...less"). A correct version could be: "The less you would want, the less you would eat." or "The more you would want, the more you would eat."
0	The sentence contains a small error known as a split infinitive. In traditional English grammar, it's generally advised to avoid splitting infinitives (e.g., "to run" or "to eat") with adverbs ("more"). A better way to phrase the sentence would be, "The more John eats, the more he has to pay." Alternatively, if you want to keep the original structure, you could say, "I demand that he eat more; the more he eats, the more he will have to pay."
0	This sentence needs a comma after "Dead" to separate two independent clauses that are connected by the coordinating conjunction "she." The corrected version would be: "Mary listens to the Grateful Dead, and she gets depressed." Alternatively, one could also use a semicolon instead of a comma before "she," but since no such punctuation was provided, I assume it's incorrect.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It uses the comparative form of the adjective ("angrier") to compare Mary's level of anger over time and employs a correlative construction ("the...the") to link two clauses together. Additionally, there is no subject-verb agreement issue or any other grammatical error present in this sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "the higher the stakes," which is a comparative phrase functioning as the subject. It is followed by the verb "are." In the predicate, there is a relative clause modifying "his expectations" - "that his expectations are low." Both the syntax and semantics of the sentence make sense, so it's grammatically correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("the more Fred is obnoxious"), a verb ("should pay"), and an object ("to him"). Additionally, it uses the comparative structure "the more...the less" correctly, indicating that as one thing increases (Fred's obnoxiousness), another decreases (the amount of attention paid to him).
1	The sentence "John was lots more obnoxious than Fred" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "Lots more" functions as a comparative degree modifier for the adjective "obnoxious." It indicates that John possesses a significantly greater amount of the quality denoted by "obnoxious" compared to Fred. * Both "lots" and "more" can modify adjectives in certain contexts, and their combination here is idiomatic and widely accepted in informal American English. In formal or academic writing, it might be better to use other constructions such as "considerably more," but the original sentence is still grammatically valid.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It follows a clear subject-verb-object structure ("you" as the subject, "give" as the verb, and "beer to people" and "people get sick" as objects). Additionally, it uses proper idiomatic phrasing (the comparative construction "the Xer you Y, the Zer they W"). There are no grammatical errors or awkward phrasings that would detract from its clarity or coherence.
0	This sentence is grammatically incorrect due to the use of the comparative form "more" twice in a row. A corrected version could be "The more Bill smokes, the more Susan hates it." or "The more Bill smokes, the more she hates him."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject ("the more pictures of him that appear in the news") is a comparative clause that modifies the adjective "embarrassed". It uses the structure "the + comparative degree + that-clause", which is a common way to form complex comparatives in English. The verb tense is consistent throughout (past perfect progressive), and there are no errors in word choice or agreement. Therefore, I would rate this sentence as grammatically correct.
1	The sentence "Every senator seems to become more corrupt, as he talks to more lobbyists" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "Every senator" functions as a subject of the sentence, indicating that we are talking about all members of the Senate. This phrase agrees with the singular verb "seems," which indicates a state or condition rather than an action in progress. * "seems to become" is a grammatical construction used to indicate a gradual change over time. It consists of a linking verb ("seems") followed by an infinitive form of the main verb ("to become"). * "more corrupt" describes the degree of corruption associated with each senator. Since "corrupt" is already an adjective, there's no need for any additional words to modify it. * "as he talks to more lobbyists" provides a reason for why senators might be becoming more corrupt. It contains a subordinating conjunction ("as"), a pronoun ("he"), and a present participle form of the verb ("talking"). This structure is grammatically valid and conveys the intended meaning clearly. Overall, the sentence follows standard rules of English syntax and usage, making it a grammatically correct expression.
0	The sentence has a grammatical error. It is missing a verb after "he likes". A corrected version could be "Who does John visit because he likes Sally?" or "Who does John visit since he likes Sally?".
1	The sentence "Marianne did not leave" is grammatically correct. It follows the standard structure of a simple sentence, consisting of a subject ("Marianne"), an auxiliary verb ("did"), and a main verb in past tense ("leave"). Additionally, it uses the negation particle "not," which maintains grammaticality while altering the meaning to indicate that Marianne didn't depart.
1	The sentence "He could not have been working" is grammatically correct. It is in the past perfect continuous tense, which describes an action that began and was still in progress in the past before another past action started. Here, "could not have been working" indicates that the subject was continuously doing something in the past up until some point when he couldn't be working anymore.
0	The sentence contains a double negative ("can not" and "not"), which results in a positive statement when it's actually intended to be negative. This makes the sentence grammatically incorrect. A better way to phrase the sentence would be "He cannot have been working." or "He must not have been working."
1	The sentence "You will believe Bob." is grammatically correct. It consists of a subject ("you"), an auxiliary verb ("will"), and a main verb ("believe") that agrees with the subject in number (singular). Additionally, there is an object ("Bob"). All these elements form a simple sentence which conveys a clear meaning, making it a proper English sentence.
1	The sentence "John has not kissed Mary" is grammatically correct. It follows the standard structure of a simple sentence with a subject ("John"), an auxiliary verb ("has"), and a past participle verb form ("not kissed"). Additionally, it uses proper spelling and punctuation, making it a complete and coherent statement.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows the proper structure of subject-verb agreement, uses appropriate punctuation, and includes precise word choice. Additionally, it utilizes inversion after the initial clause ("never in my life") to emphasize the rarity of the speaker's experience. Overall, the sentence effectively communicates its intended meaning without any grammatical or syntactical errors.
0	In this sentence, "it" should be moved before the verb "looked up." The correct form would be "Mickey looked it up," where "looked up" functions as a phrasal verb meaning to search for information about something.
1	The sentence "There tended to be a lot of discussion" is grammatically correct. The verb tense is consistent throughout the sentence (past tense), and all words are spelled correctly. Additionally, the subject-verb agreement is also correct as "there" serves as a dummy subject and the real subject "discussion" agrees with its verb "be."
1	The sentence "John tried to be a good boy" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "John," which is the person who is attempting to do something. The verb in the sentence is "tried," which indicates that John made an effort to become a good boy. This verb agrees with the singular subject "John." Additionally, the adjective "good" correctly modifies the noun "boy." Therefore, there are no errors in this sentence.
1	The sentence "John is eager" is grammatically correct. It consists of a proper noun (John) acting as the subject, followed by a linking verb (is), which describes the state or condition of the subject, and an adjective (eager), which modifies the meaning of the subject by describing its emotional state. All parts of speech used here are being employed correctly according to their function within the structure of the sentence.
1	The sentence "We want John to win" is grammatically correct. Here's why: - "We" is a pronoun that refers to the speaker or group of speakers. It is the subject of the sentence. - "want" is a verb that indicates desire or intention. In this case, it is used as an auxiliary verb (also called a helping verb) to form the present continuous tense. - "John" is a proper noun that functions as the direct object of the sentence. A direct object receives the action of the verb. - "to win" is an infinitive phrase that acts as the complement of the direct object "John." An infinitive phrase can function as a noun, adjective, or adverb in a sentence. In this case, it describes what the direct object wants to do. Overall, the sentence has a clear structure and meaning, so it is grammatically correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("the box"), a verb ("contained"), and an object ("the ball"). Additionally, it includes prepositional phrases that modify the object and clarify its origin ("from the tree"). There are no spelling or grammar errors present, so I would rate this as a correctly written English sentence.
0	In standard English, we would say "The tube was escaped **from** by gas" or more commonly, **"Gas escaped from the tube."** Here, the verb "escape" requires a preposition such as 'from' to indicate where something has escaped from. Additionally, the subject of the active form ("gas") becomes the object when converted to passive voice ("the tube").
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The verb "bubbled" agrees with its subject "water," as both are past tense forms. Additionally, the phrase "up out of" functions together to indicate movement emerging from a source, which is appropriate in this context.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It contains a simple subject ("the tub") and a predicate verb phrase ("leaked water"). Additionally, it uses proper spelling and capitalization.
1	The sentence "What the water did to the bottle was fill it." is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "What" serves as a relative pronoun introducing a clause that modifies the noun phrase "the water." It functions as the subject of the dependent clause. * "the water" is the agent performing the action described by the verb. * "did" is an auxiliary verb used here for emphasis and to form the passive voice. * "to the bottle" is a prepositional phrase acting as the indirect object of the verb. * "was fill" is a linking verb followed by the past participle of the verb "fill," which acts as the complement describing what the water did to the bottle. * "it" refers back to "the bottle," making the meaning clear.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It uses the passive voice ("was filled") correctly, and all of the words are spelled and used properly. Additionally, the subject-verb agreement is consistent throughout the sentence.
0	In this sentence, there is a preposition error. Instead of saying "leaked the fluid free," it should say "leaked fluid freely." This is because when we use the verb "leak" followed by the substance that is being leaked (in this case, "fluid"), we don't need to add an article ("the"). Additionally, "free" should be replaced with the adverb "freely" since it modifies the verb phrase "leaked fluid."
1	The sentence "John lay the ball in the box" is grammatically correct. The past tense of the verb "to lie," which means to place something gently on a surface, is "lay." Therefore, the usage of "lay" here is appropriate since it indicates that John deliberately placed the ball inside the box.
1	The sentence "John owns the book." is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple subject (John) and a predicate (owns the book). There are no spelling or punctuation errors, and the word order follows standard English syntax rules.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It shows two actions being performed on two different people using the coordinating conjunction 'and'. Each action consists of a verb ('persuade') followed by its direct object ('Mary' or 'Sue'), an infinitive marker ('to'), and the infinitive form of the verb ('leave' or 'stay'). This structure is commonly used in English to describe multiple related actions.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It uses the subjunctive mood to express uncertainty or a hypothetical situation ("consider...guilty"). This form is used when stating that something might be true (but isn't necessarily) or when talking about desires or demands. In this case, it indicates that most people believe Klaus could have been guilty of murder, but he wasn't officially found so by the court.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Mary," who is described by the adverb "beautifully." The verb of the sentence is "plays," which indicates that Mary is engaging in an action or activity. Finally, we have a direct object "the violin" receiving the action from the verb. Therefore, there are no grammatical errors present in this sentence.
0	The sentence contains two errors related to verb tense agreement and unrealistic expectations. A more appropriate way to phrase it would be: "Clearly, John will likely pick up French quickly." Here's a breakdown of the issues: 1. Verb Tense Agreement: "probably" does not agree in tense with "will". It's better to use "likely" which can be used with "will" for future expectation. 2. Unrealistic Expectations: Learning any language perfectly takes time, effort, and dedication; thus, claiming that someone will do so "immediately" sets unrealistic expectations. Instead, we could say they will pick it up or start learning it quickly.
0	In English, we typically say "Sue gave Bill a book," without using "to" after "gave." The preposition "to" is already implied by the verb "gave," so it's redundant to include it again. Therefore, the original sentence is incorrect and should be revised as I mentioned above.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple future tense verb phrase ("will leave") that describes what multiple people (the men) will do in the future. There are no spelling errors or awkward phrasings to detract from its clarity.
1	The sentence "John went home." is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("John"), a verb ("went") that agrees with the subject in number (both singular), and an object complement ("home"). All of these elements form a complete thought, making it a simple sentence. Additionally, there are no spelling or punctuation errors present in the sentence.
0	The sentence contains two errors related to preposition usage. Instead of "represented seriously," it should be "presented themselves seriously." Additionally, instead of "as a genuine linguist," it should be "as a genuine linguist's work" or simply "as genuine linguists." A possible corrected version could be: "They presented themselves seriously to Dean Mary as genuine linguists' work."
0	In modern English, subject pronouns (I, you, he, she, it, we, they) typically come before verbs. The verb "love" requires a subject, but "they" comes after the verb instead of before it. A correct version of this sentence would be "They love us."
1	The sentence "It is nice to go abroad" is grammatically correct. Here's why: - "It is" is a linking verb that connects the subject ("it") to the adjective phrase "nice." - "Nice" describes the experience of going abroad. - "to go" is an infinitive form of the verb "go," which functions as the direct object of the sentence. - "Abroad" is an adverb modifying the verb "go." Overall, the sentence has a clear structure and all words are used appropriately in their intended function, making it a grammatically correct sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Mary," who is performing the action of intending something. The verb is "intended" which is in the past tense and takes a direct object ("John") and an infinitive phrase ("to go abroad"). Both the subject-verb agreement and word order are correct. Therefore, there are no errors in this sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It uses the past perfect tense ("had kissed") to indicate that the action of kissing occurred prior to another past action or time. The verb "remembered" is in the past tense, which matches the time frame established by the use of the past perfect tense. Overall, the sentence clearly communicates a specific sequence of events in the past.
1	The sentence "I can't believe Fred won't, either." is grammatically correct. Here, the subject of the sentence is "I," and the verb is "can't believe." The conjunction "either" connects the main clause to another negative statement, which is "Fred won't." This construction creates a parallel structure that makes the sentence clear and easy to understand. Therefore, there are no grammatical errors or awkward phrasing in this sentence.
0	In this sentence, there is a missing article before the word "story." A more grammatically correct version would be "John wants to read Fred's **a** story, and I also want to." However, even with this correction, the sentence still sounds somewhat awkward or incomplete. It might flow better as "John wants to read Fred's story, and I do too," or something similar.
0	The second clause of the sentence, "who to," is incorrect. It should be "whom to invite." In modern English, it is common for people to use "who" instead of "whom," but if you want to follow formal grammar rules, "whom" should be used as the object of a preposition or verb (in this case, "to"). A more natural way to phrase the sentence would be, "We wanted to invite someone, but we couldn't decide whom to invite."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It contains two independent clauses ("Mary will read Fred's story" and "Joe will read Holly's") that are connected by a conjunction ("and"). Each clause has a subject ("Mary," "Joe") and a verb ("will read"), which makes it complete. Additionally, there are no spelling or punctuation errors in the sentence.
0	This sentence is grammatically incorrect because it lacks a conjunction or proper punctuation to connect the independent clauses "Mary claimed that eating cabbage" and "Holly shouldn't." A corrected version could be: * "Mary claimed that eating cabbage was beneficial, but Holly shouldn't." * "Mary claimed 'eating cabbage.' Holly shouldn't." (Using a dash for interruption)
0	The second half of the sentence, "I also came to be," is grammatically incorrect. It would need to say "so did I" or "I also came" in order for it to make sense and follow standard English usage.
1	The sentence "If I can, I will work on it." is grammatically correct. It contains a conditional clause ("if I can") followed by a main clause ("I will work on it"). Both clauses contain proper subject-verb agreement, and there are no spelling or punctuation errors. Additionally, the word order follows standard English rules.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "Joe's neuroses" is a possessive noun that refers to the neuroses belonging to someone named Joe. This is followed by the verb "bother." * "His patrons" is also a possessive noun referring to the patrons of whatever establishment or situation Joe is involved in. It follows logically from the first part of the sentence since we can assume that Joe's behavior affects those who interact with him. * Finally, "Sally does too" is a common idiomatic expression used to indicate agreement or similarity between two subjects. In this case, it implies that just as Joe's neuroses bother his patrons, so too do Sally's (presumably similar) actions or behaviors affect her own group of people.
0	The sentence contains a grammatical error. Specifically, the pronoun "it" does not have a clear antecedent (the word that it refers back to) in the second part of the sentence. It appears that "it" is supposed to refer to the book that Lilly read for José, but this connection needs to be made more explicit through the use of a pronoun such as "that." A corrected version could read: "I know which book José didn't read for class, and which book Lilly did instead for him."
0	The second sentence contains a grammatical error. It should be "this is the one that Fred won't do" instead of "this is the one which Fred won't do it." In relative clauses where the relativized element is the object, we use "that" rather than "which," and we omit the pronoun (in this case, "it") after the verb.
0	The sentence has a mistake in verb tense consistency. The first part of the sentence uses the simple present tense ("I know which book Mag reads"), while the second part uses the past perfect tense ("Bob had said that you hadn't"). To fix it, both parts should use the same verb tense. Here's one possible correction: "I knew which book Mag was reading, and Bob had told me that you hadn't."
0	This sentence contains multiple errors. The first error occurs after "Mag," where there is a missing article before "book." It should be "which book Mag read" or "which book Mag's reading." The second error appears near the end of the sentence when referring to "my report." Instead of saying "you hadn't," it would be grammatically correct to say "that you had not submitted" or simply "that was missing from your submission." A corrected version could be: * Corrected Sentence: I know which book Mag read and which book Bob read, (but) I noticed that you were missing my report.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. Here's a breakdown of why: * The subject-verb agreement is correct (I'm - plural verb would). * There are no spelling or punctuation errors. * The comparison between liking someone eating fruit versus cookies is logically sound and clear. * The use of "more than" indicates a preference, which is appropriately used here.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. Here's a breakdown of why: * "Rusty" is the subject of the first clause and is correctly modified by the adjective "talked." * "about" is a preposition that introduces the prepositional phrase "about himself," which modifies the verb "talked." * The conjunction "only" separates the two clauses and indicates that Rusty talking about himself occurred after Mary had already done so. * "Mary" is the subject of the second clause and is also correctly modified by the past tense form of the verb "to talk." * "did talk" emphasizes the action performed by Mary, making it clear that she was the one who initiated the conversation about Rusty. * Finally, the relative pronoun "him" refers back to the antecedent "Rusty," indicating that the same person was being discussed throughout both clauses.
0	The sentence contains a redundant use of the verb "talk" after "Rusty did." A corrected version would be: "Fred talked about everything before Rusty did talk about something." or "Fred talked about everything before Rusty talked about something." In either case, it's best to avoid repeating the same word unnecessarily.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence, "John," is the person who performs the action of the verb, "meets." The object of the sentence, "Mary," is the person who receives the action of the verb. Both the subject and object are proper nouns, which are capitalized. Additionally, the verb tense is consistent throughout the sentence, using the present simple tense to indicate regular occurrences in the past, present or future. Overall, the sentence follows standard English grammar rules.
0	The verb "perceive" should be followed by a preposition such as "as," "by," or "that." Additionally, there seems to be some confusion about subject-verb agreement here; if we were to rephrase the sentence to make it grammatically correct, it might read something like "The problem can easily be perceived" or "This issue is easily perceived." However, without more context it's difficult to say for sure what the intended meaning of the original sentence was supposed to be.
1	The sentence "A hundred men surrounded the fort" is grammatically correct. Here's a breakdown of why it works: * "A hundred" functions as a determiner that specifies the quantity of men. It modifies the noun "men," which agrees in number with the plural verb form "surrounded." * "Surrounded" is the past tense of the verb "to surround," indicating that the action occurred in the past. This verb agrees with its subject, "a hundred men," in both number (plural) and person (third). * The prepositional phrase "the fort" describes where or what the action was performed upon. In this case, "fort" serves as the object of the preposition "the." Prepositions link nouns, pronouns, or phrases to other words within a sentence, often conveying spatial relationships between entities. In summary, each component of the sentence contributes to its overall coherence and grammaticality.
0	The verb "elected" requires an object to complete its meaning. In this case, it would be more appropriate to say "We elected **someone**," where "someone" refers to the person who was chosen for a position or office. Without an explicit object, the sentence can be confusing as it's unclear what the subject (we) did to the object (me).
0	The sentence contains a mistake in verb tense agreement. The past tense of the verb "submit" (which would be "submitted") does not agree with the subject "he," which requires a present tense form ("submits"). A corrected version could read: "Which report does he submit stating that John was incompetent?" or "Which report stating that John was incompetent did he submit?"
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Mary," which is a noun. The verb is "has preferred," which shows third-person singular present tense agreement with the subject. The prepositional phrase "to limes" modifies the verb by indicating what Mary prefers over something else (limes). Overall, this sentence follows all standard rules for English syntax and usage.
0	The sentence contains a misplaced modifier, making it unclear what was whining - the cats or something else that the speaker let outside. A clearer way to phrase the sentence would be "He let out the cats, which were whining." This makes it clear that the cats were the ones doing the whining, rather than implying that whatever was let out was whining.
1	The sentence "What did Bill buy?" is grammatically correct. It is a question that uses the past tense of the verb "buy" to ask about a specific action performed by someone named Bill. Since there are no grammatical or spelling errors in this sentence, I am returning 1 as the label indicating its correctness.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Mary," who is performing the action of seeing something. The verb "saw" indicates that she performed this action in the past. The object of her vision is "the boy." We know he is moving because of the present participle phrase "walking toward the railroad station." Participial phrases describe or rename a noun (in this case, "boy") by giving more information about it. They can come at the beginning, middle, or end of a sentence but must be set off from the rest of the clause either by commas or by location within the sentence to avoid misreading the grammar. Here, the phrase comes after the noun it modifies, so no punctuation marks are needed.
0	The sentence contains multiple errors. First, the past participle of the verb "give" should be "given," but it's misspelled as "giver." Second, there is a missing article before "John." Therefore, a corrected version would read: "A proof that the claim had been given was provided by the fact that John had lied."
0	The sentence contains multiple grammatical errors that make it difficult to understand. Here's how we can fix them: - Use "as" instead of "which was caused by" for clarity and concision. - Place the preposition "by" closer to its object, "an overloaded transducer." - Add a definite article before "fire," as there has already been mention of one specific fire earlier in the sentence. The corrected version would read: He attributed the fire that destroyed most of my factory to a short circuit caused by an overloaded transducer.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "The mayor" is the subject of the sentence and it is singular, so we use the third-person singular verb form "regarded." * The phrase "as being absurd" functions as an adjectival clause modifying the noun "proposal," which follows the normal word order for such clauses (i.e., introductory element followed by the linking verb "being" and the predicate adjective). * The infinitive phrase "to build a sidewalk" serves as the direct object of the verb "absurd." It is headed by the infinitive marker "to," which indicates that it functions as a complement rather than an adjunct. * Finally, the prepositional phrases "from Dartmouth to Smith" modify the noun "sidewalk" and indicate its location or extent. Overall, the sentence has a clear structure and all elements are used appropriately, making it grammatical and comprehensible.
1	The sentence "I want that Bill left to remain a secret" is grammatically correct. However, it might be clearer if rephrased as "I want Bill to leave so that it remains a secret," depending on what exactly is meant by "it." Nonetheless, the original sentence's structure is valid, with "that" introducing a content clause functioning as the direct object of "want."
0	This sentence contains multiple errors. The word "who" indicates that we're talking about one person, but the verb form "Tom drives" suggests that there are two people driving (one being driven by the other). Additionally, the repetition of "as drives" is unnecessary and grammatically incorrect. A corrected version could be: "I know a man whom Tom drives." However, using "that" instead of "whom" would also be acceptable in most contexts: "I know a man that Tom drives."
0	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in this sentence. "Cats" is a plural noun, so the verb should be "are," but since we're discussing drowning cats as a single group (which is illegal), it should read "Drowning cats, which is against the law, is hard to rescue." However, even after fixing the agreement issue, the sentence remains semantically awkward due to mixing singular ("is") and plural forms ("cats"). A better way to phrase the idea would be: "Rescuing cats that are drowning can be difficult because it is illegal to let them die."
1	The sentence "Muriel said nothing else than that she had been insulted" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "Muriel" is a proper noun and serves as the subject of the sentence. * "said" is the verb, which indicates past tense. It agrees with the subject in number (singular) and person (third). * "nothing else than that" is a correlative conjunction used to emphasize what follows. In this case, it highlights that Muriel only said one specific thing - that she had been insulted. * "she" is a pronoun that refers back to "Muriel." * "had been insulted" is the passive voice form of the verb phrase "to insult," indicating that someone or something has performed the action on Muriel. This construction is appropriate for conveying the intended meaning.
0	The sentence contains a grammatical error. The subject of the sentence is "Himself," which is a reflexive pronoun used to refer back to the subject of the sentence. However, it's incorrect to say that a person is being understood; instead, we use the verb "understand" when talking about someone who understands something or someone. Therefore, the corrected version of the sentence would be "Rutherford understands himself."
1	The sentence "I feel that Arch will show up" is grammatically correct. Here's a breakdown of why: * "I feel" is a common way to express an opinion or intuition about something. * "that" introduces a subordinating conjunction which connects two clauses together. * "Arch" refers to a specific person or entity. * "will show up" indicates a prediction about the future action of that person or entity. The sentence has a clear subject ("I"), verb ("feel"), and object clause ("Arch will show up"). Therefore, it is a complete and coherent thought expressed in standard English grammar.
0	The sentence contains a couple of errors. Firstly, it is missing a verb, which makes it a sentence fragment rather than a complete sentence. Secondly, the word "this" does not have a clear antecedent, making the meaning of the sentence unclear. A corrected version could be: "The proof that this set is recursive is difficult to construct."
0	This sentence contains a grammatical error known as a misplaced modifier. In this case, "which Henry plays the lute and sings" is intended to modify "the madrigals," but it has been placed so that it seems to modify "sound." A corrected version of the sentence would be: "The madrigals that Henry plays and sings sound lousy." Alternatively, for clarity, one could also say: "Henry's playing and singing of the madrigals sounds lousy."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. Each part of the sentence has a clear subject (Tom, I, Suzie) and predicate (picked, washed, will prepare), and they are connected using appropriate conjunctions (and). Additionally, the verb tenses are consistent within each clause and across clauses, which indicates that the actions occur in sequence. Overall, there are no grammatical errors or awkward constructions that would warrant changing or correcting any part of the sentence.
1	The sentence "Where did you go and who ate what?" is grammatically correct. It is a question that asks for two pieces of information - where the person went and what each person at the gathering consumed.
0	This sentence contains multiple errors that make it difficult to understand its intended meaning. The first error is the lack of a determiner before "boy's." It appears that the writer intended for this phrase to modify another noun (e.g., "Which boy's dog did we elect..."), but as written, it suggests possession without specifying whose. Additionally, there is no verb agreement between "which" and "did," which requires a plural subject. Finally, the string of possessive forms ("guardian's employer") is confusing and unclear. A clearer version of this sentence would require rephrasing and better punctuation.
1	The sentence "How sane is Peter?" is grammatically correct. It is a question asking about someone's mental state using the adjective "sane." The word order is correct, and there are no spelling or punctuation errors. Therefore, I would classify this sentence as being grammatically correct and assign it a score of 1.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It contains two independent clauses joined by the conjunction "and". Each clause has a subject ("I" and "my dad") and a predicate ("live at the place where Route 150 crosses the River" and "lives at the place where Route 150 crosses the Hudson River"). Additionally, each clause expresses a complete thought. Therefore, no punctuation or coordinating conjunction is needed between them.
0	The pronoun 'it' used in the second clause of the sentence is ambiguous because both 'place' and 'Route 150' have been mentioned earlier as possible antecedents (words to which a pronoun refers). To avoid confusion, consider revising the sentence using one of these options: * Correct Sentence #1: "I live at the place where Route 150 crosses the Hudson River, and my dad lives there as well." * Correct Sentence #2: "I live near where Route 150 crosses the Hudson River, and my dad does too." * Correct Sentence #3: "The location where Route 150 meets the Hudson River is where I reside, and so does my father."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The phrase "to make up to" can mean to try to become friendly with someone again after a disagreement or to flatter someone in order to get something from them. So the sentence is asking who she is currently trying to win back over or curry favor with.
0	The past tense of "get" is "got," but here it's used incorrectly as the past participle. In passive voice constructions such as this one, we need to use the past participle form after "was." So instead of saying "Wind was gotten," we should say "Wind had been got" or, more commonly, "Wind had been obtained." However, even that would sound rather old-fashioned today; modern usage would simply be "The wind was taken out of the plot..."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "Mike" is a proper noun, referring to a specific person named Mike. Proper nouns always start with a capital letter. * "talked" is the past tense of the verb "to talk." It indicates that the action took place in the past (yesterday). * "about" is a preposition indicating the topic or subject of conversation. * "politics" is a plural countable noun that functions as the object of the preposition "about." * "yesterday" is an adverb modifying when the action occurred. * "to" introduces an indirect object. * "my friends" refers to a group of people known to the speaker. They function together as the indirect object of the sentence because they received the information from Mike.
1	The sentence "It was expected by the reporters that the principal would fire some teacher" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "it," which refers to the expectation on the part of the reporters. The verb "was expected" agrees with the singular subject "it." The clause "that the principal would fire some teacher" functions as the direct object of the sentence, providing more information about what was expected. Overall, there are no grammatical errors or awkward phrasings in this sentence.
0	The pronoun used in this sentence does not match the gender of the name mentioned earlier. The name "Mike" is typically a male name, but the pronoun "she" refers to a female. It would be grammatically correct if either the name was changed to a female one or the pronoun was changed to "he."
0	The sentence contains a grammatical error known as a misplaced modifier. The phrase "never wore this hat" describes which girl was being referred to, but it is placed next to "Mike", making the sentence unclear. A better way of phrasing the question would be: "Which girl has Mike said never wore this hat?" or "Which girl never wore this hat, according to Mike?"
1	The sentence "We donated wire for the convicts to build cages with." is grammatically correct. It contains a simple subject ("we") and a verb phrase ("donated wire"), followed by a prepositional phrase ("for the convicts") and another verb phrase ("to build cages with"). Each of these elements is used correctly, so there is no need for correction.
0	The sentence "I won't have some money" is grammatically incorrect. In negative statements using "won't," we use "any" instead of "some." So, the correct form would be "I won't have any money."
1	Yes, the sentence "Do you believe the claim that somebody was looking for something?" is grammatically correct. The subject-verb agreement is consistent as "do" agrees with "you", and "believe" agrees with "somebody". Additionally, the tense remains constant throughout the sentence, making it a coherent statement.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It contains a verb ("won't ask"), a subject ("you"), an object ("me") and two subordinate clauses ("that he tried to force...", "to give her any money"). Each clause has its own subject and verb, making it clear who did what. Additionally, the use of punctuation (commas) separates the different parts of the sentence correctly.
1	The sentence "That Sam sometimes didn't sleep must have pleased somebody" is grammatically correct. Here's a breakdown of why: - "That Sam" functions as a subject complement, referring to someone who has already been mentioned or implied in the conversation. - "Sometimes didn't sleep" is a verb phrase that indicates habitual non-action (Sam did not sleep on some occasions). - "Must have pleased" is another verb phrase indicating past deduction or assumption about something that happened before another action or event. - "Somebody" is a pronoun used to refer to an unspecified person. Overall, the structure and syntax of the sentence are correct, making it a valid English sentence.
0	The pronoun used to refer back to the subject of a sentence (the person or thing that is doing or being something) must agree in number with its antecedent (the word it refers back to). In this case, "himself" is a reflexive pronoun that agrees in number with its singular antecedent "Winston," but because "to" indicates indirect object relationship here, we need an objective form of the pronoun which is "he." So, a grammatically correct version would be "I talked to Winston about him."
0	The first part of the sentence, "That the fuzz wanted him worried John," contains multiple errors. There should be a comma after "him" to separate two independent clauses, and it should read "that worried John." Additionally, "fuzz" is informal slang for police officers and may not be understood by all readers. In general, using formal language is best practice when writing grammatically correct sentences. The second half of the sentence is almost correct; however, there should be a comma after "her" as well since it separates two independent clauses. So, the corrected version would be: "That the fuzz wanted him worried, John was, but that they wanted her, Mary wasn't."
0	This sentence contains a common error known as a tense agreement problem. The verb "will" indicates future tense, but it has been used incorrectly with the present participle "working." It would be grammatically correct to say either "I'll work on it if Sam works on it" (simple present tense) or "I'll work on it if Sam will be working on it" (future progressive tense).
1	The sentence "I'll work on it if I can." is grammatically correct. It contains a first-person singular subject ("I") followed by an auxiliary verb ("will"), a base form of the main verb ("work"), a preposition ("on"), and another pronoun ("it"). Additionally, there is a subordinating conjunction ("if") introducing a dependent clause ("I can") that functions as the condition for the action expressed in the independent clause. Overall, all elements are used correctly, making the sentence grammatical.
0	The preposition "with" is incorrect in this context. It would be more appropriate to say "Here's a knife for you to cut up the onions." Alternatively, if the intended meaning is that the knife has been provided specifically for the person being addressed to use, one could also say "Here's a knife for your use in cutting up the onions," although this is somewhat wordier.
0	The sentence contains a mistake in punctuation and word usage. Instead of using a comma after "sick," a period or a semicolon should be used because it separates two independent clauses. Additionally, "which" should be replaced by "but." A corrected version would read as follows: "Fluffy is sick, but not everyone knows."
1	The sentence "Maxwell is quite a doctor" is grammatically correct. Here, 'quite' is used as an adverb to express that Maxwell has a significant degree of being a doctor (perhaps meaning he is very skilled or experienced). There is no error in grammar, word choice, tense agreement, subject-verb agreement, pronoun usage, etc., so it returns 1 for a correct sentence.
0	There is a superfluous comma after "tall" which creates a comma splice error as it separates two independent clauses without any coordinating conjunction or a semicolon. A corrected version would be: "The younger woman might have been tall and the older one definitely was blond."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It uses a coordinating conjunction (", and") to connect two independent clauses about each person's height and hair color. Each clause has a subject ("Sally" and "Sheila"), verb ("is" for both), and complement ("tall," "blond"). Additionally, there is proper use of punctuation throughout the sentence.
1	The sentence "I have to try to finish grading some papers" is grammatically correct. Here's why: - The subject of the sentence is "I," which is a pronoun that refers to the speaker. - The auxiliary verb "have" indicates possession or obligation, and it agrees with the subject. - The main verb is "try," which is modified by the infinitive phrase "to finish grading some papers." This phrase functions as the direct object of the sentence. - The word "grading" is the present participle form of the verb "grade," and it modifies the noun "papers." - Overall, the sentence expresses a necessary action (having to try) followed by the goal of finishing something (grading some papers). Therefore, there are no grammatical errors.
0	There is a redundant preposition "for" before "you." A corrected version of the sentence would read as follows: "The socks are ready for you to put on to be planned." However, even after removing the redundancy, there remains another issue - the phrase "to be planned" does not make sense in this context because socks do not need planning when being worn or prepared to wear. Therefore, I will assume that what was intended here is simply: "The socks are ready for you to put on," which conveys a more logical meaning.
1	The sentence "It is easy to play sonatas on this violin" is grammatically correct. The subject-verb agreement is consistent as "it" agrees with the singular verb "is." Additionally, the word order is appropriate for a declarative statement. All of the words are spelled correctly, there are no missing or extra punctuation marks, and the meaning is clear. Therefore, I would classify this sentence as being grammatically correct.
1	The sentence "This violin is difficult to play sonatas on" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "This violin" is a noun phrase that refers to a specific instrument. * "is" is the linking verb connecting the subject ("this violin") to its complement ("difficult to play sonatas on"). * "difficult" modifies the infinitive phrase "to play sonatas on," indicating the degree of challenge associated with playing sonatas on this particular violin. * "to play" is an infinitive verb form introducing the purpose or reason for the difficulty. * "sonatas" is the direct object of the infinitive verb "play." * "on" is a preposition governing the prepositional phrase "on which" (although it's omitted here), specifying where the action takes place. Therefore, the sentence expresses a complete thought and follows standard English syntax rules.
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect due to a missing conjunction between "please" and "my father." A corrected version could be "My mother is easy to please both my father and me," or "My mother easily pleases my father and me."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It contains a coordinating conjunction ("and") that connects two independent clauses. Each clause has a subject ("Poor Bill" and "he") and a verb ("had started" and "had no"). This structure creates a compound sentence, which is a type of complex sentence. Additionally, the use of punctuation is appropriate for the sentence's meaning and syntax.
0	The sentence contains multiple errors. There is a missing article before "robbery," making the sentence grammatically incorrect. Additionally, the structure of the sentence suggests that the word "that" may be unnecessary and could cause confusion regarding what exactly is being referred to as "terrible." A corrected version might read: "The fact that the cops spoke to the janitor about the robbery yesterday is terrible."
0	This sentence contains multiple errors in subject-verb agreement and pronoun reference. The phrase "Every student" requires a singular verb form, so it should be "is," not "are." Additionally, the pronoun "he" lacks clear antecedent referents; using plural noun phrases ("students") followed by singular pronoun forms can cause confusion for readers. A corrected version could read: "Each student, and they wear socks, is (or: those students who wear socks are) a swinger."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "that girl," which is singular and feminine. The verb "was given" agrees with the subject in number (singular) and tense (past). The indirect object is "me," expressed as a possessive pronoun "my." The direct object is "binoculars," which follows the verb and receives the action. Finally, "by him" indicates who performed the action, making it clear and unambiguous. Therefore, there are no errors in this sentence.
1	The sentence "Bill didn't allege that Roger had eaten anything" is grammatically correct. Here's a breakdown of why it's correct: * "Bill didn't allege" forms a negative verb phrase using the auxiliary verb "didn't." This construction correctly expresses past tense negation for the subject "Bill." * The conjunction "that" introduces a subordinate clause ("that Roger had eaten anything"). It functions as a complementizer here, linking two clauses together. * The verb within the subordinate clause, "had eaten," uses the past perfect form to indicate a completed action before another past time reference (in this case, implied by "alleged"). * Finally, the pronoun "anything" serves as the direct object within the subordinate clause, referring back to food or items consumed. In summary, all elements of grammar, syntax, and usage appear to be appropriate in this sentence; therefore, I would classify it as grammatically correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "Nobody" is a singular pronoun that refers to no person or thing. It requires a singular verb, which we have here in "should work." * "Who hates to eat anything" is a relative clause modifying "nobody," indicating the type of person being referred to (i.e., someone who dislikes eating). This part of the sentence is also grammatically correct because it uses the subject form "who" rather than the object form "whom" since it functions as the subject of its own clause. * Overall, the sentence conveys a clear meaning without any grammatical errors.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. Here's a breakdown of the structure: * Everybody (subject) + around here (modifying phrase indicating location) + who ever buys anything on credit (relative clause modifying the subject) * talks (verb) * in his sleep (prepositional phrase modifying the verb)
0	The sentence contains a minor error related to pronoun agreement. The phrase "the name of somebody" should be replaced with "someone's name." A corrected version would read as follows: "I can't remember someone's name who had misgivings."
1	The sentence "No writer, and no playwright, meets in Vienna." is grammatically correct. There are two independent clauses ("no writer meets in Vienna" and "no playwright meets in Vienna") connected by a conjunction ("and"), which creates a compound predicate. Each clause has a subject ("writer" and "playwright") and a verb phrase ("meets in Vienna"). This structure follows standard English syntax rules for forming complex sentences.
0	The sentence contains a grammatical error. It should be either "No writer nor any playwright **meets** in Vienna" (if it refers to present tense) or "No writer nor any playwright **met** in Vienna" (if it refers to past tense). However, as written, neither option makes sense grammatically without making changes to both verbs.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "that," which refers to a future event (you marrying any student). The verb is "is" and it agrees with its singular subject. Additionally, there is no misplaced modifier or other common grammatical errors. Therefore, I would rate this sentence as grammatically correct.
1	The sentence "Felicia kicked the ball off the bench" is grammatically correct. Here's a breakdown of why it works: * Felicia - This is a proper name that serves as the subject of the sentence. It refers to the person who performed the action described by the verb. * kicked - This is the past tense of the verb "to kick," which indicates that Felicia did something active in the past (specifically, she caused her leg or foot to move quickly and forcefully against an object). * the ball - This is a noun phrase serving as the direct object of the sentence. A direct object typically follows the verb and receives the action denoted by the verb. In this case, Felicia's kicking motion was directed towards the ball. * off - This preposition shows directionality away from a reference point (in this case, the bench). Prepositions often introduce phrases specifying spatial relationships between objects. * the bench - Like "the ball", this noun phrase functions as a complement for the preposition "off". Together they form a prepositional phrase indicating where the ball ended up after being kicked.
1	The sentence "I sent the package halfway around the world" is grammatically correct. Here's a breakdown of why it works: * "I" serves as the subject of the sentence, referring to the person who performed the action. * "sent" is the past tense of the verb "send," indicating that the action has already been completed. * "the package" functions as the direct object, receiving the action of being sent. * "halfway around the world" modifies the verb phrase "sent the package." It tells us how far the package was sent (not all the way around the world but just part of the way). This phrase consists of two prepositional phrases ("around the world" and "halfway") connected by the conjunction "and." Overall, each component of the sentence fits together well, making for a coherent and error-free construction.
0	The phrase "gave the ball out" is incorrect because it implies that the ball was given out as if it were a prize or award. To indicate that Sam physically moved the ball from inside the basket to outside of it, we would say "Sam took the ball out of the basket." Alternatively, if Sam gave someone possession of the ball while it was still inside the basket, we could say "Sam handed the ball out of the basket." Without additional context, however, the original sentence seems most likely to be unintentional error rather than intentional use of idiomatic language.
1	The sentence "Sam offered the ball out of the basket" is grammatically correct. Here's a breakdown of why: * "Sam" is the subject of the sentence, which is a proper noun and correctly capitalized. * "offered" is the verb or the action that the subject performs. It agrees with the singular subject "Sam." * "the ball" is the direct object because it receives the action of being offered by Sam. * "out of the basket" describes where the ball came from when it was offered, so it functions as an adverbial phrase. Overall, the structure of the sentence follows standard English syntax rules, making it a grammatically correct sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence, "Park Square," is a proper noun that refers to a specific location. The verb "has" indicates possession or existence, which is appropriate for the context. Finally, the phrase "a festive air" functions as an adjectival complement, describing the atmosphere or appearance of Park Square. Overall, the sentence is clear, concise, and follows standard English grammar rules.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "the worker," which is singular. The verb that agrees with a singular subject is "will have." The object of the sentence is "a job," which follows the correct verb tense. Overall, the structure and grammar of this sentence are correct.
0	The sentence contains a pronoun error. It should be "you all" or "you guys" instead of just "you." Here's why: When using the phrase "that comment to," it implies more than one person received the comment. Therefore, the plural form of "you" (i.e., "you all" or "you guys") would be grammatically correct. So, the corrected sentence could read as follows: "No one can forgive that comment to you all." However, for simplicity, we often use "you" even when addressing multiple people; therefore, another possible correction is simply rephrasing the sentence so that it doesn't require a plural subject: e.g., "No one can forgive such a comment."
1	The sentence “We launched the rocket to the moon, but it blew up before it got there” is grammatically correct. It contains a complete thought, or independent clause (“We launched the rocket to the moon”), followed by a dependent clause (“but it blew up before it got there”) that adds additional information about the main clause. Both clauses contain proper subject-verb agreement, and all words are spelled correctly. Additionally, punctuation is used appropriately throughout the sentence.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no spelling errors or awkward phrasings, and all of the verb tenses agree with each other. Additionally, the sentence contains a clear subject ("Sarah"), verb ("promised" and "gave"), and object ("her old car" and "it"). It also expresses a complete thought, making it a full sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The verb "lend" is used correctly in the past tense, and it agrees with the subject "I." Additionally, "the book" is a proper direct object that follows the transitive verb "lent," indicating who or what was lent. Finally, the prepositional phrase "partway to Tony" modifies how or where the action of lending occurred. Overall, the sentence conveys a clear meaning without any grammatical errors.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "the farmer," which is doing the action "loaded." The direct object of the sentence is "the cart," which is receiving the action. The prepositional phrase "with apples" tells us what was put into the cart. All of the elements of the sentence work together to create a complete thought, making it a correct sentence in English.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The verb "dumped" agrees with its subject "the farmer," as both are singular. Additionally, the prepositional phrase "with apples" correctly modifies the noun "cart."
0	The verb "carved" does not agree with its subject "Martha." Since Martha is singular, the verb should also be singular, so it should be "carved" instead of "carved." A corrected version would be "Martha carved a toy out of wood for the baby."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "the bread," which is a singular noun. The verb that follows it, "cuts," is also singular and agrees with the subject. Additionally, the word order is correct, making this sentence a simple active sentence.
0	The verb "broke" does not make sense in this context when used with the preposition "on". Additionally, we cannot break a person's body part; it would be more appropriate to say that someone injured or hurt another person's body part. A possible correction could be: "Janet accidentally injured Bill's finger."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("Janet"), a verb ("broke") and an object ("the cup"). The word order follows standard English syntax rules. Additionally, all of the words used are spelled correctly and there are no punctuation errors.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple tense verb ("rang") that indicates past action performed by the subject ("the visitor"). Additionally, there is no spelling errors or missing punctuation marks. Therefore, I would rate this sentence as being grammatically correct.
0	The sentence "We pulled free" is grammatically correct but it is missing context to be fully understood. It's unclear what the subject (we) was pulling or why they were trying to become free. Additional words would help clarify the meaning of the sentence.
1	The sentence "That movie always shocks people" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "that movie," which is a singular noun. The verb "shocks" agrees with the singular subject and is in the present tense. The object of the sentence is "people." There are no prepositions or conjunctions missing from the sentence, and there are no unnecessary words included. Therefore, the sentence is grammatically correct.
1	The sentence "That movie always shocks" is grammatically correct. It consists of a noun phrase ("that movie") followed by a verb phrase ("always shocks"). There is no subject-verb agreement error or any other grammatical mistake in the sentence. Therefore, it can be considered a well-formed English sentence.
0	The sentence "Sharon came the room" is incorrect because it lacks a preposition such as "to" or "in." A correct version of the sentence could be "Sharon came into the room" or "Sharon came into the room."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Bill," who is performing the action of sending something. The direct object of the sentence is "a package," which is what is being sent. Finally, we have the indirect object "to Tom," indicating where or whom the package was sent. All elements work together well here, creating a complete thought that follows standard English syntax rules.
1	The sentence "That acorn will grow into an oak tree." is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("that acorn"), a verb tense that indicates future action ("will grow"), and an object complement ("an oak tree"). There are no spelling or punctuation errors, and the word order follows standard English syntax rules.
1	The sentence "He turned into a frog." is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence, "he," is clearly identified, and the verb, "turned," agrees with it in number (both singular). Additionally, the preposition "into" indicates the completion of the action expressed by the verb. Finally, the object of the preposition, "a frog," specifies what "he" transformed into. Thus, there are no errors in grammar or usage that would warrant changing the score to 0.
1	The sentence "I mixed the sugar into the butter." is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "I", which is the person performing the action. The verb is "mixed", which describes the action being performed. The direct object is "the sugar", which is the thing that is being acted upon. Finally, "into the butter" tells us where the action was done. All of these elements together form a complete thought, making the sentence grammatical.
0	The sentence "Brian threw the fence with the stick" is grammatically incorrect because we cannot throw a fence with a stick. It would be more appropriate to say that Brian used the stick to throw something over or onto the fence. Additionally, it's unclear what the intended meaning of the sentence is supposed to be, which also contributes to its grammatical incorrectness.
1	The sentence "Mira condemned Terry for the accident" is grammatically correct. There are no spelling errors, punctuation errors, or grammatical mistakes in the sentence. Additionally, the word choice is appropriate, and the sentence structure follows standard English syntax rules. Therefore, I would rate this sentence as being grammatically correct and assign it a score of 1.
1	The sentence "We investigated the area for bombs" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "we," which is a plural noun referring to the speaker and one or more other people. The verb "investigated" agrees with the plural subject, as it is also a plural form. Additionally, the prepositional phrase "for bombs" correctly modifies the verb by indicating what was being looked for during the investigation. Therefore, there are no grammatical errors in this sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "I", which is a singular pronoun. The verb that follows, "sensed", is also in the past tense and agrees with the singular subject. Additionally, the object of the sentence is "his eagerness," which is correctly formed using the possessive form "his" before the noun "eagerness." Overall, there are no errors in this sentence.
1	The sentence "They praised the dedication in the volunteers" is grammatically correct. Here's a breakdown of why: * "They" is a plural subject pronoun referring to multiple people who performed an action. In this case, they praised something or someone. * "praised" is the past tense of the verb "to praise," which means to express approval or admiration for someone or something. It agrees with the plural subject "they." * "the dedication" refers to a specific instance of dedication shown by a group of people (in this case, the volunteers). Using "the" before a noun implies that it has been previously mentioned or is known to the reader. * "in the volunteers" indicates where the praised quality was found—namely, within the volunteers themselves. This phrase correctly uses a preposition ("in") followed by a noun ("volunteers").
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The past tense of the verb "to be" (is) is used correctly as "was", which agrees with the singular subject "the earth". Additionally, the passive voice structure ("was believed") is also used appropriately here.
1	The sentence "Sarah smiled a charming smile" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * The subject of the sentence is "Sarah," which is a proper noun and correctly capitalized. * The verb of the sentence is "smiled," which agrees with the singular subject "Sarah." It is also in the past tense, indicating that the action has already been completed. * The adjective "charming" modifies the noun "smile," providing more information about its appearance or quality. Adjectives typically come before the noun they modify, as is the case here. * Overall, the sentence is clear, concise, and easy to understand, making it a well-constructed example of standard English grammar.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Sandra," which is a proper noun and therefore capitalized. The verb is "beamed," which agrees with the singular subject. Finally, the object of the preposition "a" is "cheerful welcome." All elements of the sentence function correctly according to their roles, so no errors can be found.
1	The sentence "You've really lived it up" is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("you"), an auxiliary verb ("have") that agrees with the subject in number (singular), and a present participle phrase ("lived it up") functioning as the complement of the sentence. Additionally, the word order follows standard English syntax rules for declarative sentences. Therefore, there are no errors to point out or correct.
0	The verb "lift" needs to agree with its subject in number. In this case, "paperback books" is plural while "lifts" is singular, which creates a mismatch. A corrected version of this sentence would be "Paperback books lift easily onto the table." or "A paperback book lifts onto the table easily."
0	In present tense, we use 'lift' as the verb when the subject refers to a person or people (e.g., "He lifts the book.") but use 'lift' followed by 'up' when referring to objects being moved upward without specifying who is moving them (e.g., "The books lift up."). However, using 'lifted' here implies past tense; therefore, it requires a helping verb such as 'have', e.g., "The books have been lifted onto the table." Alternatively, if one wants to maintain the present tense, they could say, "The books lift up onto the table," which while less common, would still be grammatically correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence, "Jessica," is doing the action "loaded" to the direct object "boxes." Additionally, the prepositional phrase "under the wagon" tells us where the action took place. There are no grammatical errors or awkward phrasing in this sentence.
1	The sentence "Jessica loaded boxes on the wagon" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Jessica," a proper noun that refers to a person. The verb is "loaded," which describes a past action performed by the subject. The direct object of the sentence is "boxes," which receives the action of the verb. Finally, the prepositional phrase "on the wagon" tells us where the action took place. All these elements work together to form a complete and coherent sentence in standard English.
1	The sentence "Jessica crammed boxes at the truck" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Jessica," the verb is "crammed," and the object is "boxes." The prepositional phrase "at the truck" modifies the verb by telling us where the action took place. Therefore, there are no grammatical errors in this sentence.
0	The verb "butter" requires a direct object to complete its meaning. In this case, the direct object should be the food being buttered (e.g., "toast"). However, "at" is used instead of the preposition "on," which is more appropriate for physical actions involving surfaces or locations. A corrected version would be "Lora butterred the toast on the plate." Alternatively, if we want to use "at", it could be rephrased as "Lora spread butter on the toast at the table".
1	The sentence "Carla shoveled the walk" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "Carla" is a proper noun (name of a person) and is correctly spelled. * "shoveled" is the past tense form of the verb "to shovel," which means to move earth or snow with a shovel. It agrees with the subject "Carla." * "the walk" refers to a specific path or sidewalk that has been cleared using a shovel. Articles ("the," "a," or "an") help indicate whether a noun is general or specific. In this case, "the" indicates that we are talking about a particular walk.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence, "Nora," is the person performing the action described by the verb "sent." The direct object of the sentence, "the book," receives the action. Both "Nora" and "book" are proper nouns, so they require capitalization. Overall, the word order follows standard English syntax rules for a simple declarative sentence.
1	The sentence "Nora sent Peter the book." is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("Nora"), an action verb ("sent"), and two objects ("Peter" and "the book"). There are no spelling errors or awkward phrasings, so it can be understood easily by native speakers of English.
1	The sentence "Carla slid the book" is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("Carla"), a verb ("slid") that agrees with the subject in number (both singular), and a direct object ("the book"). Additionally, the word order follows standard English syntax rules.
0	The sentence "Carla slid at the book" is grammatically incorrect because the preposition "at" is used incorrectly here. The verb "slid" requires a preposition that indicates direction or location, such as "on," "over," or "under." For example, one could say "Carla slid on the ice" or "Carla slid under the table." However, it does not make sense to slide "at" something. Therefore, the sentence is marked as incorrect.
1	The sentence "Amanda carried the package to Pamela" is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple sentence with a subject ("Amanda"), a verb ("carried"), and an object ("the package"). Additionally, it includes a prepositional phrase ("to Pamela") that provides more information about where Amanda took the package. All elements are used correctly, so no corrections are needed.
0	The sentence contains a subject-verb agreement error. In this case, "packages" is plural while "drive" is singular. A better way to phrase it would be "Packages can be delivered easily to New York." or "Delivery trucks drive easily to New York."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It consists of a noun phrase ("the chair") and a verb phrase ("pushed"). The subject-verb agreement is also correct - the singular third person present tense form of the verb "to push" (i.e., "pushes") would be used if the subject was plural or a proper noun that required a singular verb to agree with it in number. Here, however, the subject is a singular common noun that takes the base form of the verb when used as the subject of a sentence. Therefore, "pushed" is the correct form to use.
1	The sentence "We offered a job to her." is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("we"), a verb ("offered") that agrees with the subject in number (both singular), and an object ("a job"). Additionally, it includes a prepositional phrase headed by "to" which specifies the indirect object of the action described by the verb. All these elements combine to form a coherent and complete thought, making the sentence grammatically sound.
0	The sentence "A job offered" is missing a subject and verb to form a complete thought or clause. In order for it to be grammatically correct, it would need to include both of those elements, such as "The company offered a job." Without them, we cannot determine who or what is doing the action (offering), so it's unclear what exactly is happening.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Brown," who is performing the action of presenting. The direct object of the sentence is "a plaque," which is what is being presented. The indirect object of the sentence is "to Jones," indicating who received the plaque. All of these elements are used correctly, so the sentence is grammatical.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Carmen," who is performing the action of buying something. "Mary" is the indirect object, receiving the dress from Carmen. "A dress" is the direct object because it's what Carmen is buying for Mary. All elements come together to form a coherent sentence without any grammatical or structural errors.
1	The sentence "Carmen obtained the spare part at the hardware store" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence, "Carmen," is a proper noun that agrees with the verb "obtained." Additionally, the object of the sentence, "the spare part," is specific and clear. Finally, the prepositional phrase "at the hardware store" provides additional information about where the action took place. Overall, the sentence has a straightforward structure and all elements are used appropriately, making it a grammatical English sentence.
1	The sentence "Michelle kept the desk with the papers" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * The subject of the sentence is "Michelle," a proper noun that refers to a person. It is correctly capitalized. * The verb "kept" is used in the past tense and agrees with the singular subject "Michelle." * The direct object of the sentence is "the desk," which follows the verb "kept." * The prepositional phrase "with the papers" modifies the verb "kept" by telling us what was being done with the desk (it had papers). This use of "with" is idiomatic and means something similar to "having" or "alongside" here. Overall, the sentence has a clear structure and uses standard English grammar rules appropriately.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence, "Frances," is the person who performed the action described by the verb "hid." The direct object of the sentence, "the presents," receives the action of the verb and tells us what was hidden. Finally, "in the drawer" describes where the hiding took place. All elements fit together smoothly to convey a clear idea without any grammatical errors or awkward phrasings.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It consists of a subject ("the needle"), a verb ("poked") that agrees with the subject in number (both singular), and an object ("the cloth"). Additionally, the word order follows standard English syntax rules.
1	The sentence "Carrie touched that cat." is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple sentence with a subject ("Carrie"), an auxiliary verb ("did") which is implied here, and an object ("that cat"). All words are spelled correctly and used appropriately in context.
1	The sentence "Herman whipped the sugar and the cream" is grammatically correct. In this sentence, the subject is "Herman," the verb is "whipped," and there are two objects - "the sugar" and "the cream." All of these elements are arranged correctly according to English grammar rules.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Linda," a noun that is performing the action described by the verb "taped." In this case, Linda has performed the action on the direct object "the picture" which comes right after the verb. Finally, we have the prepositional phrase "to the wall" telling us where the action took place. Overall, it's clear what happened in this sentence without any grammatical errors present.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The past tense verb "taped" indicates that the action of attaching the picture to the wall has already been completed. The direct object "the picture" refers to what was taped, while "onto the wall" serves as an adverbial prepositional phrase describing where the taping took place. Overall, the structure of the sentence is clear, concise, and proper for standard English usage.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. Here's a breakdown of why: * "The child" is a noun phrase serving as the subject of the sentence. It consists of the definite article "the," which specifies a particular noun (in this case, "child"), and "child," which functions as the head noun. No errors here! * "and" serves as a coordinating conjunction that connects two elements of equal rank within a clause or sentence. In this case, it links "the child" to "her mother." Again, no issues found. * "Her mother" is another noun phrase functioning as the second element connected by the conjunction "and." Just like before, there are no problems detected. * Lastly, we have the verb "clung" which describes the action taken by both "the child" and "her mother." Since the tense used throughout the sentence is past simple ("clung" refers to something that happened in the past), this fits perfectly well. Overall, all components of this sentence work cohesively without any grammatical errors.
1	The sentence "This flyer and that flyer differ" is grammatically correct. Here's why: - Both "this" and "that" are used correctly as demonstrative determiners to refer to specific flyers. - The verb "differ" indicates a comparison between the two flyers, which is appropriate for the context. - The subject ("this flyer and that flyer") agrees with the plural form of the verb ("differ"). Overall, the sentence has a clear structure and follows standard English grammar rules.
0	The phrase "differ apart" is incorrect. Instead, use either "differ" or "differ from." For example: "This flyer and that flyer differ," or "This flyer differs from that one."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. Here's a breakdown of why: * "The jeweler" (with one 'l') is the subject of the sentence, referring to a person who sells jewelry. It is in the singular form and agrees with the verb that follows it. * "scribbled" is the past tense of the verb "to scribble," which means to write carelessly or hurriedly. In this case, it indicates the action performed by the jeweler. * "the contract" refers to a written agreement between two parties, which is the object of the sentence. * "with his name" shows how the jeweler marked the contract, using his own name as a signature or identification mark. Overall, the structure, grammar, and syntax of the sentence follow standard English rules.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The verb "grew" is used correctly to indicate that the gardener caused something (the acorn) to develop or become larger over time. In this case, it means that the acorn was cultivated by the gardener until it became a full-grown oak tree. Additionally, the word order of the sentence follows standard English syntax rules, making it easy for native speakers to understand.
1	The sentence "I shaped a loaf" is grammatically correct. It consists of a subject ("I"), a verb ("shaped") in past tense, and an object ("a loaf"). No spelling or punctuation errors can be found as well. Therefore, it's a valid English sentence.
0	This sentence is missing a direct object. In order for the verb "amuse" to be grammatically correct, it needs to have a direct object (something or someone that is being amused). A possible correction would be: "The children amused us."
1	The sentence "Susan whispered the news" is grammatically correct. It consists of a proper noun (Susan), a past tense verb (whispered), and a plural countable noun (news). Additionally, there is no punctuation or spelling errors present in the sentence.
1	The sentence "Susan whispered at Rachel" is grammatically correct. In this sentence, "whispered" is the past tense of the verb "whisper," which requires a preposition such as "at" to indicate the direction or target of the whispering action. Therefore, there is no error in using "at" after the verb "whhispered."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Ellen," which is a proper noun referring to a person. The verb is "said," which is in the past tense and agrees with the subject. The complement of the sentence is "that melons were selling well." In this clause, "melons" serves as the subject, "were selling" functions as the linking verb, and "well" acts as an adverb modifying the verb phrase "selling." All elements cohere together without any grammatical errors or awkwardness, making it a correct English sentence.
0	The sentence is missing a noun or pronoun after "about" to make it grammatically complete and meaningful. A better version of the sentence could be "Ellen commented on the present conditions."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Ellen," who is doing the action of warning. The indirect object is "Helen," who receives the warning. The verb phrase "warned against" means to caution or advise someone about a potential danger or problem, which in this case is "skating on thin ice." Each word plays its role clearly and contributes to making sense in the context.
1	The sentence "Cynthia nibbled on the carrot" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Cynthia," a proper noun that refers to a person. The verb is "nibbled," which is in the past tense and agrees with the third-person singular subject. The direct object is "the carrot." The preposition "on" introduces the phrase "on the carrot," indicating where or what Cynthia was nibbling. Overall, the sentence has a clear structure and concise meaning, making it grammatically sound.
1	The sentence "Cynthia chewed" is grammatically correct. It consists of a proper noun (Cynthia), which serves as the subject, and a verb (chewed) that describes the action performed by the subject. No grammatical errors or awkward phrasings can be identified here.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Paul," who is performing the action of laughing. The object of his laughter is "Mary." Both names are in common noun form (not capitalized as proper nouns would be), but it's clear from context that they refer to specific individuals named Paul and Mary. In any case, the syntax and word usage are both appropriate for a simple declarative sentence.
0	The error in this sentence lies in the object of the verb 'wink'. In standard English, we do not say 'wink someone's body part', but rather 'wink one's eye(s)'. Therefore, a correct version would be 'Linda winked her eye.'
0	The verb "pound" needs to have a direct object that refers to what is being pounded. In this case, it seems that the speaker's heart is doing the pounding, so we need a reflexive pronoun instead of a direct object. Therefore, the corrected sentence would be: "My heart is pounding itself."
1	The sentence "Sharon fainted from hunger" is grammatically correct. In this sentence, the subject is "Sharon," the verb is "fainted," and the prepositional phrase "from hunger" functions as an adverbial of cause, explaining why Sharon fainted. Both the syntax (word order) and semantics (meaning) of the sentence are clear and appropriate for standard English usage.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It consists of a subject ("the witch"), an auxiliary verb ("poisoned") that agrees with the subject in number (singular) and tense (simple past), and an object ("the children"). Additionally, the word order follows standard English syntax rules, making it easy to understand who did what to whom.
1	The sentence "A grandfather clock ticked in the hallway" is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("a grandfather clock"), a verb ("ticked") that agrees with the subject in number (singular), and a prepositional phrase ("in the hallway") that describes where the action occurred. There are no spelling or punctuation errors, so I would rate this sentence as 1 for being grammatically correct.
0	The verb "squeak" is an intransitive verb, which means it cannot take a direct object. In the sentence "I squeaked the door," "the door" is being used as a direct object of the verb "squeak." This usage is incorrect because the door cannot be squeezed or made to produce a squeaking sound by the speaker; rather, the door itself must make the sound. A correct version of the sentence would be "The door squeaked (as I opened/closed it)" or "I squeezed/pushed the door until it squeaked."
1	The sentence "Over the fire there bubbled a fragrant stew." is grammatically correct. Here's why: * The subject of the sentence is "a fragrant stew," which is modified by the adjective "fragrant" to describe what kind of stew it is. * The verb phrase is "bubbled over the fire," where "bubbled" is the past tense of the intransitive verb "to bubble," indicating that the action was completed in the past without any direct object receiving the action. * "Over the fire" functions as an adverbial prepositional phrase modifying the verb phrase, telling us where the action took place. It contains the preposition "over" followed by its object "the fire." * Overall, the sentence has a clear structure, proper grammar, and appropriate word choice, making it a grammatically correct sentence.
1	The sentence "Soaring temperatures are predicted for this weekend." is grammatically correct. It follows the standard structure of a sentence which includes a subject ("soaring temperatures"), a verb ("are predicted"), and an object or complement ("for this weekend"). Additionally, all words are spelled correctly, punctuation is used appropriately, and there are no awkward phrasings or ambiguities that might suggest an error. Therefore, I would rate this sentence as being completely correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. There is a subject ("the fort"), verb ("fluttered") and object ("many flags"). Additionally, "with" is used correctly here to indicate that the fort had many flags on it.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It consists of a noun phrase ("the voices") acting as the subject, followed by the verb "echoed" (which agrees in number with its subject), and a prepositional phrase ("in the hall") that functions as an adverbial of place, answering the question "where?" Here's a more detailed breakdown: * Noun Phrase: "The voices" - definite article + plural countable noun * Verb: "echoed" - past tense of the irregular verb "to echo," which requires a source of sound to complete its meaning * Prepositional Phrase: "In the hall" - preposition "in" + determiner "the" + common noun "hall."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It contains a simple subject ("the stream") and a verb ("twists"), followed by a prepositional phrase ("through the valley") that modifies the action of the verb. The word order is standard for an English sentence, making it easy to understand.
0	The verb tense used in this sentence is incorrect for the intended meaning. The past participle form "presented" should only be used with a helping verb (e.g., "had presented"), but here it's being used as if it were a simple past tense verb. A correct version of the sentence would be "A wonderful opportunity presented itself yesterday."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "a wonderful opportunity," which is singular. The verb that agrees with a singular subject is "presented." Therefore, the verb tense is consistent with the subject-verb agreement rule in English grammar. Additionally, the adjective "wonderful" modifies the noun "opportunity" appropriately, and the time expression "yesterday" correctly situates the event in past time.
1	The sentence "Out of the box jumped a little white rabbit" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * The subject of the sentence is "a little white rabbit," which agrees with the verb "jumped." * The verb tense is consistent throughout the sentence (past tense). * There are no missing or extra words that would make the sentence unclear or confusing to understand. * All the modifiers ("little" and "white") are used correctly and help clarify what kind of rabbit it was. Overall, the sentence is simple but clear and concise.
1	The sentence "Penny skated around the rink" is grammatically correct. It consists of a proper subject ("Penny"), a helping verb ("skated") that agrees with the subject in number (singular), and a prepositional phrase ("around the rink") that functions as an adverbial phrase modifying how or where the action took place. All elements cohere together to form a complete thought expressed in standard English syntax.
1	The sentence "Jackie accompanied Rose" is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple sentence structure where the subject (Jackie) performs the action (accompanied) on the object (Rose). Both names are proper nouns and start with capital letters as they should be. There are no spelling errors or misplaced words, so the sentence can be understood clearly by any native speaker without ambiguity.
0	The verb "was" does not agree with its subject "many information." In this case, the noun "information" is plural, so the verb should also be plural, which means it should say "were" instead of "was". Therefore, a correct version would be: "Many pieces of information were provided."
0	The word "advice" is uncountable, so it should be used with a singular verb. The correct sentence should be "John offers much advice." or "John offers a lot of advice."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It uses a comparative structure ("more delicious") to compare two things (the cakes that Jones and Smith got), which is grammatically correct. Additionally, it uses a correlative conjunction ("than") to link the two parts of the comparison, which is also grammatically correct. Overall, there are no errors in this sentence.
0	The verb "recommend" requires a singular noun or pronoun as its subject. In this case, "we" is plural while "to eat" is singular, which creates a mismatch between the subject-verb agreement rule. A corrected version would be: "We recommend eating less cake and pastry."
1	The sentence "I saw that gas can explode" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "I", which is the person doing the action. The verb is "saw", which indicates past tense. The object of the sentence is "that gas can explode", where "that" is a conjunction used to introduce a clause, "gas can explode" is a subordinate clause functioning as the direct object. This clause contains its own subject ("gas") and verb ("can explode"). Overall, the structure and grammar of the sentence are correct.
1	The sentence "He washed her." is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple sentence with a subject ("he"), verb ("washed"), and object ("her"). There are no spelling errors or grammatical issues that would make it incorrect.
0	The correct form of the imperative sentence should be "Wash **you**r hands" or simply "Wash hands". In the given sentence, the verb "wash" does not agree with its subject "you", resulting in an incorrect sentence structure.
0	The sentence "They have no in" is grammatically incorrect because it is missing a noun or pronoun after "no." A more appropriate way to phrase the sentence could be "They have nothing," assuming that the intended meaning of the original sentence was to indicate possession or lack thereof.
0	The subject of the sentence, "Some," needs to be followed by a noun or pronoun before we can use a verb. In this case, it looks like "some" is being used as a determiner for the plural noun "jobs." To make the sentence grammatically correct, we need to add a noun or pronoun between "some" and "are": Corrected version: Some of my jobs are in jeopardy.
0	The verb tense used in the sentence is incorrect. The past tense of the verb "to meet" is "met," but it's being used as the helping verb for a present perfect tense ("has met"). Instead, it should be either "The policeman met several young students in the park last night." (simple past) or "The policeman has met several young students in the park." (present perfect).
0	The verb "did" is used incorrectly in this sentence. It seems that the speaker intended to ask a question about a past event, which would require subject-auxiliary inversion (e.g., "Did the policeman meet someone in the park?"). However, as it stands, the sentence appears to be missing its auxiliary verb or have been improperly negated.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "John," which is a proper noun. The verb is "put," which is in the past tense and agrees with the subject. The direct object is "old books," which follows the verb naturally. Finally, "in the box" tells us where John placed the old books; it functions as an adverbial phrase of place. Thus, all elements are correctly arranged and used, making this a grammatically sound sentence.
0	This sentence is missing a verb. A corrected version could be "The monkeys are proud of their leader." or "The monkeys were proud of their leader," depending on the intended tense.
0	The sentence "John sounded very" is grammatically incorrect because it lacks a complete thought or predicate. In order for a sentence to be complete, it must have both a subject (in this case, "John") and a verb (an action word). Here, we could add a word such as "happy" to make the sentence grammatically correct: "John sounded very happy."
1	The sentence "I don't know if I should agree" is grammatically correct. It contains a main clause ("I don't know") and a dependent if-clause ("if I should agree"). Both clauses contain appropriate verb forms for their subjects, making the sentence grammatically sound.
1	The sentence "John bought a book on the table" is grammatically correct. In this sentence, "John" is the subject, "bought" is the verb (past tense), "a book" is the direct object, and "on the table" is a prepositional phrase that tells us where John bought the book. All of these elements work together to form a complete thought, making it a proper sentence.
1	The sentence "John called the president a fool" is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("John"), a verb ("called") and an object ("the president"). Additionally, it uses appropriate punctuation (a period). There are no spelling errors or awkward phrasings that would make the sentence difficult to understand.
1	The sentence "I forgot how good beer tastes." is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "I", which is the pronoun used for the speaker or writer. The verb is "forgot" which agrees with the singular subject "I". The object complement describes the taste of the beer, so it follows a linking verb (in this case, "to forget"). It uses the infinitive form because it's describing a general quality rather than a specific action. Overall, the structure and usage of words in this sentence follow standard English grammar rules.
1	The sentence "This teacher is a genius" is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("this teacher") and a predicate ("is a genius"). Additionally, it uses proper capitalization and punctuation.
0	The verb "remain" should be used with a subject that does not change or move (e.g., "A good friend remains loyal to me"). In this case, the intended meaning seems to be that the person referred to as "him" has maintained their friendship with the speaker. To express this idea correctly, one could say "A good friend has been retained by him," or more naturally, "He has kept a good friend in me."
1	The sentence "John ate his noodle quietly" is grammatically correct. Here's a breakdown of why: * "John" is a proper noun that serves as the subject of the sentence. It is correctly capitalized and modifies the verb "ate." * "ate" is the simple past tense form of the verb "eat," which indicates completed action in the past. It agrees with the singular subject "John." * "his" is a possessive determiner that shows ownership or association between the noun it modifies ("noodle") and its antecedent ("John"). * "noodle" is a countable noun that refers to a type of food. It is modified by the adverb "quietly." * "quietly" is an adverb that describes how the action (eating) was performed. It provides information about manner. Overall, each word plays a clear role in the sentence, making it grammatical and easy to understand.
1	The sentence "A smith hammered the metal" is grammatically correct. Here's a breakdown of why it works: * "A smith": This is a singular noun that refers to a person who makes things out of metal, often using a forge or other heat source. It follows the standard pattern for articles ("a," "an," or "the") followed by a singular countable noun. * "hammered": This is the past tense of the verb "to hammer." In this context, it means that the smith used forceful blows to shape the metal. * "the metal": This is a definite article ("the") followed by a plural noun. While "metal" can be either singular or plural depending on context, here it's clear that we're referring to a specific piece (or pieces) of metal that were being shaped by the smith. Overall, the sentence has a subject ("a smith"), a predicate ("hammered the metal"), and proper use of grammatical structures such as articles and verb tenses. Therefore, I would rate it as grammatically correct.
1	The sentence "Sandy removed her ballet shoes" is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple sentence structure where the subject (Sandy) performs the action (removed) on the object (her ballet shoes). All words are spelled correctly, and there are no punctuation or grammar errors.
1	The sentence "This week will be a difficult one for us." is grammatically correct. Here's why: - "This" refers to a specific week that has been mentioned or implied beforehand. It could also refer to the current week if no other time frame has been established. - "week" is a noun referring to a period of seven consecutive days starting from Sunday and ending on Saturday. In this case, it serves as the subject of the sentence. - "will be" indicates future tense and links the subject ("week") to its adjective complement ("difficult"). - "a" is used before a singular countable noun to indicate quantity when there is no particular example being referred to. - "difficult" describes the quality of the upcoming week. - "one" emphasizes the uniqueness of the week being discussed. - "for us" shows the relationship between the difficulty of the week and the speaker (and others).
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence, "Benny," is clearly identified, and we understand that Benny performed work ("worked") at a specific location ("a shoe factory"). Additionally, the time frame for his employment is specified as being during his time as a student. All elements of the sentence fit together well to convey clear meaning without any grammatical errors or awkward phrasing.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject "she" has a singular verb agreement with "would sing." Additionally, the word "that" is used correctly to introduce the content clause expressing purpose or result. All other elements of the sentence follow standard English grammar rules.
1	The sentence "This proved a decisive factor" is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple sentence with a subject ("this") and a predicate ("proved a decisive factor"). The verb "prove" agrees with its singular subject "this," and the article "a" precedes the noun phrase "decisive factor." No errors can be found in this sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("the crocodile"), a verb ("devoured") and an object ("the doughnut"). There are no spelling or punctuation errors. Therefore, it can be classified as a correct sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "John," and he is modified by the adjective "afraid." The object of his fear is "Bill." Both names are in common noun form, which is appropriate for this context. Additionally, the word order follows standard English syntax rules.
0	The sentence "John put under the bathtub" is grammatically incorrect because it lacks a preposition to complete the phrase started by "put." A corrected version could be "John put the book under the bathtub" or "John put himself under the bathtub," depending on context.
1	The sentence "John placed Kim behind the garage" is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("John"), a verb ("placed") that agrees with the subject in number, and an object ("Kim"). Additionally, there is a prepositional phrase ("behind the garage") that describes where Kim was placed. All of these elements form a complete thought, making it a proper sentence.
0	The sentence "Kim depends for Sandy" is incorrect because it uses "depends for" instead of "depends on." In English, we use "depends on" to indicate a relationship where one thing relies on another for support or success. Therefore, the corrected sentence would be "Kim depends on Sandy."
1	The sentence "John put the book in the box" is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("John"), an auxiliary verb ("put"), a direct object ("the book") and a prepositional phrase ("in the box"). Each of these elements plays a clear role within the structure of the sentence. Additionally, the tense of the verb is appropriate for the context (simple past), indicating that the action occurred at some point in the past.
1	The sentence "John taught English Syntax to new students." is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "John" is a proper noun that refers to a person. It is correctly capitalized and used as the subject of the sentence. * "taught" is a past tense verb that indicates that John performed an action (teaching) on something or someone (English syntax and new students). * "English Syntax" is a compound object made up of two noun phrases that describe what John taught. Both words are appropriately capitalized since they refer to specific subjects. * "to" introduces the prepositional phrase "to new students," which describes who received the teaching. This part of the sentence is also grammatically correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "John," who is doing the regarding. The verb is "regards" which links the subject to its object, "Bill." Finally, we have the prepositional phrase "as a good friend" modifying how John regards Bill. Overall, the sentence has a clear structure and follows standard English grammar rules.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence, "Kim," is doing the action denoted by the verb "put." The direct object of the sentence, "the box," receives the action of the verb. There are no grammatical errors or awkward phrasing in this sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple subject ("The chickens") and a predicate ("seem fond of the farmer"). The verb tense is consistent throughout the sentence, and all words are spelled correctly. Additionally, the sentence structure follows standard English conventions for word order and punctuation.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It follows standard English syntax rules for subject-verb agreement (the plural subject "executives" matches with the plural verb "be") and uses proper article usage ("the"). Additionally, there are no misspelled words or other errors present in this sentence.
0	The sentence contains a grammatical error. Specifically, the verb tense used for the first subject ("Fred") does not agree with the verb tense used for the second subject ("nominated"). It would be grammatically correct to say either "That Fred was unpopular *and* nominate Bill" or "*Nominating* Fred was unpopular, so they nominated Bill." In general, it's important that all verbs in a single clause match each other in terms of tense (past, present, future) and aspect (simple, continuous, perfect).
1	The sentence "They were taking a hard look at possible FTA" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "They" refers to one or more people who are performing an action. In this case, it serves as the subject of the sentence. * "were taking" is the past continuous tense form of the verb "to take," which indicates that the action was ongoing or happening over a period of time in the past. It agrees with the plural subject "they." * "a hard look" functions as an adverbial phrase modifying the verb "looking." It means they were examining something carefully. * "at" introduces the prepositional phrase "at possible FTA." * "possible FTA" stands for Free Trade Agreements. This is the object of the preposition "at" and represents what they were looking at carefully.
0	The preposition "against" is incorrect in this context. It seems that the speaker wants to say that John paid them for a book. In this case, the correct preposition would be "for," so the sentence should read: "John paid me for the book."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "the committee," which is a plural noun taking a singular verb ("will study") because it refers to a single group acting as a unit. The infinitive phrase "setting up" functions as the direct object of the verb "study." The prepositional phrase "of setting up a national computer network" modifies the verb by explaining what specifically the committee will be studying. Overall, the structure and syntax of the sentence are clear and proper.
0	The verb "made" is a transitive verb that requires a direct object to complete its meaning. In this case, "them" is acting as the direct object of the verb "made." However, there is no clear action being performed on the direct object "them," which makes the sentence unclear and grammatically incorrect. A better way to phrase the sentence could be "We made them behave rudely" or "We caused them to be rude."
1	The sentence "After reading the pamphlet, Judy threw it into the garbage can." is grammatically correct. There are no spelling errors, punctuation errors or grammatical structures that violate the rules of standard English. Additionally, the word choice is appropriate for the context provided. Therefore, I would classify this sentence as being grammatically correct.
0	The verb must agree in number with the subject it refers to. In this case, "students" is plural, so the verb should also be plural. Therefore, the correct sentence is: "Students studying English read Conrad's Heart of Darkness while at university."
1	The sentence "I read some of the book." is grammatically correct. The subject "I" is followed by a verb tense that indicates past action, which agrees with the meaning conveyed by the word "read". Additionally, the article "the" before "book" specifies a particular book being referred to, making the phrase "some of the book" appropriate for referring to a portion of it. Therefore, no corrections need to be made to this sentence.
1	The sentence "Most of the fruit is rotten" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "Most" functions as a determiner that indicates a large quantity or amount. It modifies the noun phrase "the fruit." * "Of" is a preposition indicating a relationship between two elements, in this case, "most" and "the fruit." * "The" is a definite article used to refer to specific objects already mentioned or known by both speaker and listener. * "Fruit" is a plural countable noun referring to sweet-tasting produce from plants. * "Is" is a linking verb connecting the subject ("most of the fruit") to its predicate adjective ("rotten"). * "Rotten" is a past participle functioning as an adjective describing the state or condition of the fruit.
0	The sentence contains a double negative, which can lead to confusion about the intended meaning. A corrected version could be "Neither student failed." Alternatively, if the intent was to emphasize that neither student did poorly, it would still be clearer to say "Both students succeeded" or "Neither student failed to succeed," since using two negatives together can imply a positive but may cause momentary uncertainty for readers.
0	The error in this sentence lies in the lack of a determiner before 'water'. A more grammatically correct version would be "I drank some of the water" or "I drank some water". Without a determiner (such as 'the' or 'some'), the noun phrase 'some water' is incomplete, making the sentence incorrect.
0	The noun "hair" should be plural because it is referring to individual strands coming from someone's head. Therefore, the correct form would be "golden hairs." Alternatively, if only one strand of hair is being referred to, it should be specified (e.g., "a gold-colored hair").
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("the boy"), a verb ("waved"), and an object ("his father"). Additionally, it uses appropriate prepositions ("in" and "to") to indicate location and direction. There are no spelling errors or awkward phrasings that would detract from its clarity or accuracy as a properly constructed English sentence.
1	The sentence "That dog is so ferocious, it even tried to bite itself." is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "that dog," which is singular. The verb that agrees with a singular subject is also singular, as we see in "is" (third person present tense of "to be"). Therefore, there is no agreement error between the subject and the verb in this sentence. Additionally, word order, punctuation, spelling, and usage are all correct in this sentence.
0	The verb 'wash' requires an object pronoun (me, you, him, her, it, us, them) instead of a reflexive pronoun (myself, yourself, himself, herself, itself, ourselves, themselves). Therefore, the grammatically correct form of the sentence would be "He washed you." or "He washed himself," depending on context.
0	The sentence contains a grammatical error known as a dangling modifier. The phrase "easy to please" is intended to modify the noun "John," but it's actually modifying the implied subject of the sentence (which would be "you" or another unspecified person). A corrected version might read: "John is easy to please for Kim." However, that revised sentence still sounds awkward; a better way to express the idea might be: "Kim finds it easy to please John."
0	The sentence "There seemed to be intelligent" is grammatically incorrect because it lacks a clear subject and verb agreement. A more appropriate way to phrase this would be "It seemed that he/she was intelligent." or "Intelligent beings seemed to be present."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence, "John," is the person who is trying to do something, which is expressed by the infinitive phrase "to please Stephen." This structure is a common way to express an attempt or effort to accomplish something in English.
0	This sentence is grammatically incorrect because of the improper use of the word 'fountain'. The phrase 'a fountain' refers to a physical object, whereas 'John to be a fountain' does not make any sense in this context. It seems that there was a mistake in using 'John' as a 'fountain', which changes the meaning of the whole sentence. Therefore, it would require revision for proper understanding and accuracy.
0	The verb "tries" is in the third person present tense, which requires a subject that also agrees in number (i.e., it should be singular). However, the subject of the sentence, "it," refers to something unspecified leaving the country. A more specific noun or pronoun should replace "it." Additionally, if we assume "it" refers to some entity trying to escape from a place, the correct form would still require a gerund (-ing) after "trying": "It is trying to leave the country."
1	The sentence "John tries to leave the country" is grammatically correct. Here's why: - "John" is a proper noun that serves as the subject of the sentence. - "tries" is the base form of the verb, which agrees with the singular third-person subject "John." It indicates an attempt or effort being made by John. - "to leave" functions as the infinitive phrase acting as the direct object of the sentence. This part shows what John is trying to do. - "the country" refers to a specific country and acts as the indirect object of the sentence. It describes where John wants to go when leaving. Overall, the structure of the sentence is clear, concise, and adheres to standard English grammar rules.
1	The sentence "Under the bed seems to be a fun place to hide" is grammatically correct. Here's why: - The subject of the sentence is "under the bed," which functions as an adverbial phrase modifying the verb "seems." It tells us where something appears to be. - The linking verb "seems" connects the subject to the predicate nominative "a fun place to hide." This part of the sentence describes what "under the bed" appears to be. - The word order follows standard English syntax rules. Overall, there are no grammatical errors or awkward phrasings that would make this sentence incorrect.
0	The verb "is" should be used instead of "to be" because the subject "there" is singular. Also, "sheep" should be pluralized as "sheeps" when we use it with a determiner like "some." However, "sheep" can function as both singular and plural, so no s is needed here. Therefore, the corrected sentence is: "There is said to be a sheep in the park." or "There are believed to be sheep in the park."
0	The verb tense in the sentence is incorrect. Instead of "I hope to would study," it should be "I hoped to study" or "I hope to study." In the first option, the past tense implies that the speaker wanted to study in France before but may no longer have that desire. In the second option, the present tense expresses a current wish to study there in the future.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence, "John," is a singular noun that agrees with the singular verb "can kick." Additionally, the direct object of the sentence, "the ball," is correctly identified by the action verb "kick."
0	The verb "rain" is an intransitive verb which does not take a direct object. It also describes weather conditions and thus uses third person singular form (i.e., rains) rather than its base form when referring to future tense or present simple tense. Therefore, the grammatically correct sentence would be "John will be raining tomorrow." However, it still sounds unnatural because we typically don't say that someone "will be raining". A more natural way to express this idea might be "It will rain tomorrow."
0	The verb tense is incorrect in this sentence. Instead of "there to will rain," it should be "it will rain." Also, "expect" does not require a preposition before its object; we can simply say "I expect it to rain." So the corrected version would be: I expect it to rain.
1	The sentence "John was found in the office" is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("John"), a helping verb ("was"), a past participle verb form ("found"), and a prepositional phrase ("in the office") that functions as an adverbial of place, indicating where John was found. There are no spelling errors or misplaced words, so the sentence can be understood easily by native speakers of English.
0	The verb tense used in this sentence is incorrect. In English, when we talk about a current or ongoing situation (in the present), we use the base form of the verb (does/do + verb). Therefore, the correct question would be "Does the child being in the school?" However, it's more common to say "Is the child in the school?" instead.
1	The sentence "It did not rain" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "it," which is used as a dummy subject to form a grammatical structure for negated sentences referring to weather conditions. The verb in the sentence is "rain" in its past tense form "did not rain." This structure correctly conveys that it was not raining during a specific time period in the past. Therefore, there are no errors in this sentence.
0	The sentence "John wants not to leave the town" is grammatically incorrect because it violates the rule of negation in English grammar. Instead of using "not" after a verb that already contains negative polarity such as "want(s) not", we use "do-support" or simply contract "does not" into "doesn't". Therefore, the corrected version would be either "John doesn't want to leave the town" or "John wants not to go away from the town."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject-verb agreement is consistent throughout (Mary likes, Bill hates), and each clause contains a complete thought expressing opposite preferences using coordinating conjunctions (but).
1	The sentence "They needn't take this exam" is grammatically correct. The word "needn't" is a contraction of "do not need," which can be used to express that something is not necessary or required. In this case, it indicates that the subjects (they) do not have to take the exam. Therefore, I would classify this as a correct sentence.
1	The sentence "Ann may spend her vacation in Italy" is grammatically correct. It consists of a subject ("Ann"), a modal verb ("may"), a base form of the verb ("spend"), a possessive adjective ("her"), and a location complement ("in Italy"). All elements are used correctly and there are no grammatical errors or awkward constructions that would make it difficult for native speakers to understand the intended meaning.
1	The sentence "They love to play golf, but I do not." is grammatically correct. In the first clause, "they" is a plural subject that agrees with the verb phrase "love to play," which is also in the present tense. In the second clause, "I" is a singular subject that agrees with the negative auxiliary verb "do not." This type of construction (called "subject-auxiliary inversion") is required for standard English negation in statements. Overall, the coordination between clauses using the conjunction "but" is appropriate as well.
1	The sentence "George has spent a lot of money, hasn't he?" is grammatically correct. It is a question that uses subject-auxiliary inversion (has -> hasn't) to form a tag question. Additionally, the use of the pronoun "he" as a reference to George later in the sentence maintains proper agreement between subjects and their corresponding pronouns.
0	The sentence contains an error related to verb tense agreement. The word "scarcely" means almost not or barely, so it's typically followed by a negative form of a verb. However, here it is used incorrectly with the past simple tense "could." Instead, we should use the past perfect tense "had been able to" for consistency. A corrected version would be: "As a statesman, scarcely had he done anything worth mentioning."
1	The sentence "We never found any of the unicorns" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "We" is a subject pronoun used correctly as the subject of the sentence. * "never" is an adverb modifying the verb phrase "found." It indicates that the action did not occur at any time in the past. * "found" is the past tense of the verb "find," which agrees with the subject "we." * "any" is a determiner used to modify the plural noun "unicorns," indicating that none were discovered. * "of the unicorns" is a prepositional phrase acting as an adjunct of quantity, specifying what was being searched for but not located. Overall, each word is used appropriately, and the grammatical structure of the sentence follows standard English conventions.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no spelling errors or punctuation mistakes. Additionally, the structure and syntax of the sentence follow standard English rules. Furthermore, it correctly uses the possessive form (Korea's) to indicate ownership of something by a singular noun ending in 's'. Overall, the sentence conveys its intended meaning clearly without any ambiguity.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "somebody," which is a singular, third-person pronoun that requires a singular verb. In this case, "apparently struck" agrees with "somebody." Additionally, the phrase "during the early morning hours" correctly modifies when the action occurred. Overall, the syntax and word choice are appropriate for standard English usage.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple past tense verb ("was driven") that agrees with its subject ("the car"), which is also in the third person singular form. Additionally, the word order follows standard English syntax rules, making it a well-formed sentence.
1	The sentence "Ricky can be relied on" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "Ricky" is a proper noun that refers to a person or thing (in this case, a person). Proper nouns always start with a capital letter. * "can be" is the auxiliary verb used here to indicate possibility or ability. It agrees with the subject "Ricky." * "relied on" is the past participle form of the verb "rely," which means "to depend on someone or something for support." In this context, it implies that Ricky is trustworthy and reliable. * Overall, the sentence has a clear structure and meaning, making it a grammatical English sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It uses the past participle form of the verb "sleep" to indicate that someone had been using the bed for sleeping before the present moment.
0	The verb tense used in the sentence does not make logical sense. The past tense of the verb "weigh" would be "weighed," but it's incorrect to say that a "pound" (a unit of weight) did the action of weighing something else. Instead, the sentence should state what object or person did the action of weighing the pound. For example, "The book was used to weigh the pound."
1	The sentence "Who do you think Tom saw?" is grammatically correct. It is a question asking for the identity of the person that someone thinks Tom saw. The word order follows the rules for subject-auxiliary inversion in questions in English, so there are no errors to point out.
1	The sentence "he had spent five thousand dollars" is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple past perfect tense verb phrase ("had spent") followed by the object ("five thousand dollars"). There are no spelling, punctuation, or grammatical errors in this sentence.
0	The pronouns used in this sentence do not agree. It should be "he" instead of "her" because the previous noun, "Fed," implies a male subject. Therefore, the corrected sentence should read: "Fed knows which politician he to vote for." However, even after changing "her" to "he", the sentence still does not make sense. There seems to be a missing verb or preposition before "to vote". For example, it could be rephrased as: "Fed knows which politician he should vote for."
0	The sentence contains a pronoun without a clear antecedent, making it unclear who "he" refers to. A more specific subject or context would be needed for clarity. Additionally, the phrase "how did you guess" implies uncertainty about whether something actually happened, whereas the use of the past tense verb "fixed" indicates certainty. It might be better to say "How did you know he fixed the computer?" if asking how someone became aware of a completed action, or "How did he fix the computer?" if seeking information on what steps were taken.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "the committee," which is a plural noun taking a singular verb ("knows"). This is because committees function as unitary actors rather than collections of individuals when performing their official functions. The clause "whose efforts to achieve peace" is a relative clause modifying an implied but unwritten "people." It uses the possessive form "whose" correctly; "whose" can be used for people or things (e.g., "the car whose engine is making that noise"), unlike "who" or "that," which can only refer to people. Finally, the infinitival phrase "to achieve peace" acts as the object of the relative pronoun "whose"; it's modified by the adjective "peaceful." Therefore, there are no grammatical errors in this sentence.
0	The sentence "Which house does your friend live?" is missing a verb tense agreement between the subject ("your friend") and the main verb ("live"). It should be either "which house does your friend lives in?" or "which house does your friend live in?" (the latter being grammatically correct). Additionally, it may also require a preposition such as 'in' or 'at'.
1	The sentence "the baker from whom I bought these bagels left" is grammatically correct. It uses a relative clause ("from whom I bought these bagels") to provide additional information about the noun phrase ("the baker"). This construction is formal and somewhat old-fashioned, but it is still commonly used in written English. The verb tense is consistent throughout the sentence, and there are no misspelled words or other errors that would affect its meaning or grammaticality. Therefore, the sentence can be considered grammatically correct.
1	The sentence "I found the place where we can relax." is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple sentence with a subject ("I"), a verb ("found") and an object ("the place"). Additionally, it includes a clause expressing purpose or reason ("where we can relax") which is set off by a pair of punctuation marks (in this case, two commas) to show that it's nonessential information. All parts of speech and grammar rules follow standard conventions, so there are no errors to correct.
0	The phrase "with whom" indicates that the pronoun should be possessive ("whose"), but here it's used as the object of a preposition ("in love with"). A correct version would be "Jack is the person whom Jenny fell in love with," or better yet, using the objective case form directly after the verb "is": "Jack is the person Jenny fell in love with."
1	The sentence "There is a bench to sit on." is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("a bench"), a helping verb ("is"), and a predicate complement ("to sit on"). Additionally, it uses proper prepositional phrasing with "on" indicating where one can sit on the bench.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "I", which is the person performing the action. The verb is "met", which describes the action being performed. The object of the sentence is "the man", which is the receiver of the action. Finally, we have a relative clause "who grows peaches" that modifies "the man". This clause includes its own subject ("who") and verb ("grows"), so it's a complete clause. Overall, the sentence has a clear structure and follows standard English grammar rules.
0	The sentence contains a common grammatical error known as a pronoun agreement error. In this case, "his" does not agree with the plural subject "you." A correct version of the sentence would be: "Which topics did you choose without getting his approval?" or "Which topic did you choose without getting their approval?" depending on whether one or multiple people were being referred to by "you."
0	The sentence contains a pronoun error. It should be "you got bored" instead of "Mary got bored". Also, it lacks a comma after "Which topic", making it a run-on sentence. A corrected version would be: "Which topic did you get bored discussing, because Mary talked about it for so long?"
1	The sentence "That is the reason why he resigned" is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("that"), a linking verb ("is"), a complement ("the reason") that renames the subject, and an adverbial clause of cause ("why he resigned"). All words are spelled correctly, all punctuation marks are used appropriately, and there are no awkward or unclear constructions. Therefore, it is a well-formed sentence in standard English.
1	The sentence "It bothers me that John coughs" is grammatically correct. Here's a breakdown of why it works: * "It" serves as the subject of the sentence and refers to an unspecified or general situation (in this case, being bothered). * "bothers" is the verb, which agrees with its singular subject "it." This verb indicates the action taken by the subject. * "me" is the object of the preposition "that," referring to the person who experiences the feeling of being bothered. * "that" introduces a subordinate clause ("John coughs") providing additional information about what specifically is causing the bothering sensation. * "John" is the subject of the embedded clause, while "coughs" is the corresponding verb indicating his action.
0	The verb "to please" should be followed by a subject and a base form of a verb (without to). In this case, it would be more grammatically correct to say "John is easy to please." This structure shows that John receives pleasure from something or someone else's actions, rather than implying that John himself can actively do the pleasing.
1	The sentence "Kim is eager to please Tom" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Kim," which is followed by a linking verb "is." After the linking verb, we have the adjective phrase "eager to please" modifying the subject, and finally, we have the object "Tom." All parts of speech are used correctly and the syntax follows standard English rules, making it a grammatically correct sentence.
1	The sentence "That we invaded Iraq really bites" is grammatically correct. Here, "that" is a conjunction used to introduce a subordinate clause, "we invaded Iraq" is the subject of the sentence, and "really bites" is the predicate, which consists of an adverb "really" modifying the verb phrase "bites". Although it might be more common to hear expressions such as "I regret that...", or "It's unfortunate that..." followed by an undesirable event, there's nothing inherently wrong about using "bite" metaphorically to express disappointment over something that has already happened. Therefore, I would say this sentence is acceptable in informal contexts, even if its tone may come across as less than fully mature or serious.
0	The first word of the sentence should be capitalized. Therefore, the corrected version would be: "It annoys me that Fido barks."
1	The sentence "Who achieved the best result was Angela." is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "who," which refers to a person who has been previously mentioned or implied. The verb "was" agrees with the singular subject "who." Finally, the object of the preposition "of" is "the best result," which modifies the noun "who." Therefore, there are no errors in this sentence.
1	The sentence "It was the peasant girl who got it" is grammatically correct. Here's a breakdown of why that is so: - "It" serves as the subject of the sentence and refers to something or someone unspecified. - "was" is the past tense form of the linking verb "to be," which agrees with the singular subject "it." - "the peasant girl" is a noun phrase serving as the complete subject of the relative clause "who got it." It consists of the definite article "the," the adjective "peasant" modifying the noun "girl," and the whole noun phrase functions as the antecedent for the relative pronoun "who." - "who" is a relative pronoun introducing the relative clause "who got it." It refers back to the antecedent "the peasant girl" and agrees in number (singular) with its antecedent. - "got" is the simple past tense of the irregular verb "get" and completes the meaning of the relative clause "who got it," indicating possession or acquisition by the referent "the peasant girl."
0	The error in this sentence lies in the plural form used after "anyone." Since "anyone" refers to a single individual, it requires a singular verb or pronoun to follow. Therefore, the correct version of this sentence would be: "That kind of person is hard to find anyone to look after." OR "Those kinds of people are hard to find anyone to look after." depending on whether we're referring to one type (singular) or multiple types (plural) of persons.
1	The sentence "A sick owl doesn't hunt mice." is grammatically correct. It follows standard subject-verb-object word order and uses proper verb tense agreement between "sick" (adjective) and "doesn't hunt" (verb phrase). Additionally, it employs appropriate article usage before both nouns.
1	The sentence appears grammatically correct. It uses proper subject-verb agreement ("who has" instead of "who have") and follows a logical structure. Additionally, all words are spelled correctly and punctuation marks are used appropriately. Therefore, I would classify this as a correct English sentence.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The phrase "any language other than English" is a prepositional phrase modifying "language," and it is set off by a pair of punctuation marks (here, a pair of commas), which indicates that it is nonessential to understanding the meaning of the sentence. This is a common way to include additional details in a sentence without interrupting its flow.
0	The sentence contains a contraction error. It should be "I'm sure we have even gotten these tickets!" instead of "I'm sure we even got these tickets!". In American English, "have" is used after "I'm sure," followed by the past participle form of the verb (in this case, "gotten").
0	The sentence contains a contraction error. It should be "I'm not even sure if/whether we have gotten these tickets!" instead of "I'm even sure we got these tickets!"
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. Here's a breakdown of why: * The subject-verb agreement is correct - "it" (singular) matches with "is" (singular). * The phrase "because I have any sympathy for urban guerrillas" is a dependent clause modifying the independent clause "I helped him." Both clauses contain their own subjects ("I") and verbs ("have," "helped"), so there is no confusion or ambiguity about who did what. * The term "urban guerrillas" is a proper noun referring to a specific group of people, so it does not need an article before it. * Overall, the sentence conveys a clear meaning without any grammatical errors.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The clause "it isn't because..." sets up a negative cause-and-effect relationship, which is followed by the reason for the speaker's anger ("Sue said anything bad about me"). This structure is clear and coherent, making the sentence grammatically sound.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The independent clause "That he was hungry" contains a subordinating conjunction ("that") that introduces a clause functioning as the subject of the sentence. The second independent clause "John whined" expresses the main action of the sentence. Together, they form a complex sentence with two clauses joined by a comma to show their relationship.
0	The sentence contains two grammatical errors. First, there is no need for both "gave" and "a book," as they convey the same meaning. Second, it would be more appropriate to say "I gave Mary a book after the party." This order makes it clear that the speaker gave the book to Mary rather than vice versa.
0	The second part of this sentence should be connected to the first part using a conjunction such as "so" or a transition word such as "therefore." As it stands, there is no clear connection between the two clauses, making the sentence grammatically incorrect. Here's one way to fix it: * Corrected version: Because she's so pleasant, I really like Mary therefore. * Or because she's so pleasant, I really like her for that reason.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are two independent clauses ("Though he may hate those that criticize Carter" and "it doesn't matter") connected by a conjunction ("but"), which makes the sentence a compound sentence. Additionally, each clause has a subject and a verb, so they can stand alone as complete thoughts. Therefore, the sentence structure is correct. Furthermore, there are no misspelled words or incorrect word choices, making the sentence free of grammatical errors.
0	The sentence contains a grammatical error known as subject-verb agreement. In this case, "would" does not agree with its subject "John." A correct version of the sentence could be "Without a job, John would not be happy," or "With no job, John wouldn't be happy." Here, "would not" (or "wouldn't") agrees with the singular subject "John."
0	The correct form of this sentence should be "I have **much** of the manuscript **to type**" or "I have **a lot of** the manuscript **left to type**." In the first corrected version, we use 'much' before a singular noun (manuscript) without an article ('the'). In the second corrected version, we can also say 'a lot of', which means 'much' but requires a plural noun or a singular noun with a determiner such as 'the'.
1	The sentence "He's a more reliable man" is grammatically correct. Here, we have a contraction ("he's") which stands for "he is," followed by the article "a" and the adjective "more reliable." Since all of these elements follow standard grammar rules, I will assign it a score of 1.
0	The sentence contains a minor error known as a double negative, which can make the meaning of the sentence unclear. Instead of saying "Any trouble is what I don't want," it would be better to say "I don't want any trouble." This way, the negatives do not cancel each other out, leading to a clearer and more direct statement.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "they," which refers to a plural noun that has been mentioned earlier or is implied in the context. The verb "may grow" indicates possibility, while "as high as" shows comparison. Finally, "bamboo" serves as the point of reference for the height being discussed. All elements conform to standard English grammar rules, making the sentence correct.
0	The sentence contains a grammatical error. The phrase "as many errors as" requires a plural noun to follow it, but instead we have the singular noun "20." A corrected version could be: "Some of them made as many errors as twenty." Alternatively, if referring specifically to individual instances of making an error rather than counting up all those errors, one might say "some of them made as many errors as did twenty others," where both "errors" and "others" are grammatically plural.
0	The pronoun "himself" is a reflexive pronoun that refers back to the subject of the sentence. In this case, the subject is "Sally," which is a female name. Since "Sally" cannot kiss herself, we need to use the correct form of the reflexive pronoun, which would be "herself." Therefore, the corrected version of the sentence would be "Sally kissed herself."
1	The sentence "Drew believes I think Rosie loves magazine ads." is grammatically correct. Here's a breakdown of why: * "Drew" is the subject of the first clause, and it is followed by the verb phrase "believes". This forms a complete thought. * "I think" is another clause that adds additional information about what Drew believes (i.e., that the speaker thinks something). It is set off by a comma to show that it is nonessential to understanding the meaning of the sentence. * "Rosie loves magazine ads" is the object of the second clause ("I think"). It consists of the subject "Rosie", the verb "loves", and the direct object "magazine ads". All three elements are required for a grammatical sentence. Overall, the sentence contains four clauses, all of which are punctuated correctly and follow standard rules for word order and structure. Therefore, it can be considered grammatically correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It contains a list of five names (Dave, Dan, Erin, Jaime, and Alina) followed by a verb tense that indicates past action (left). The use of a comma after each name except for the last one is also correct according to standard English punctuation rules.
1	The sentence "Hopefully, we'll make it through the winter without snow." is grammatically correct. Here, "hopefully" functions as a sentence adverb modifying the whole clause "we'll make it through the winter without snow," indicating that the action is done with hope or expectation. It has no connection to location or manner. The verb tense agrees with the subject, and there are no punctuation errors or awkward phrasings. Overall, the sentence flows well and conveys its intended meaning clearly.
0	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in this sentence. The singular noun "leather" does not agree with the plural verb form "shows". Additionally, it's unclear what "Blue" is modifying in this context. A better way to phrase this would be: "The blue leather handbag shows off how pretty Betsy is."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject "Gwen" is clearly identified as doing the action of hitting something (the direct object), which is "the baseball". Both nouns and verbs agree in number (singular) and tense (past). No punctuation or spelling errors can be found either.
0	The sentence contains a spelling mistake. It should be "I think you knew the answer" instead of "I hit that you knew the answer". In addition to that, it's also important to note that "that" can often be omitted from sentences like these without changing their meaning.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It uses a common structure for expressing uncertainty or surprise, using "either" implicitly (I've either lost my wallet or I've lost my mind). Each half of the sentence has a subject ("I") and a verb ("have lost"), followed by the object of the verb ("my wallet" or "my mind"). Both halves use parallel structures to connect related ideas.
1	The sentence "It was a brand new car that he bought" is grammatically correct. Here's why: - The subject of the sentence is "it," which refers to the car being described. - The verb tense used is past simple ("was") for the linking verb, indicating that the action took place in the past. - The predicate adjective "brand new" describes the noun "car." - The relative clause "that he bought" provides additional information about the car by using the relative pronoun "that" as the subject and the past simple verb form "bought." Overall, the sentence has proper syntax, word choice, and punctuation.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of both clauses (he) agrees with their verbs (likes, hates), and each clause contains a complete thought expressing a single action or state (likes cookies, hates crumb cake). Additionally, the coordinating conjunction 'and' connects two independent clauses properly.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "they," who are doing the action of chasing. The direct object is "the man," which receives the action of being chased. Finally, we have the prepositional phrase "with the car" that tells us how or by what means they were chasing him. All parts of the sentence are clear and concise, making it a grammatically sound construction.
1	The sentence "I didn't have a red cent" is grammatically correct. This phrase is an idiomatic expression that means someone did not have any money.
0	The sentence contains multiple errors. There is no article before "Blackwell," which makes it unclear what "from Blackwell" refers to. Additionally, there should be a conjunction such as "and" between "poems" and "takes." A corrected version might be: "The book of poems and 'From Blackwell' takes a very long time to read." However, since I am unsure about the intended meaning of "from Blackwell," I cannot provide a definitive correction.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There is a noun phrase ("the one with a red cover") that functions as the subject of the sentence, followed by a verb phrase ("takes a very long time to read"). The verb agrees with the singular subject, so there is no error in number agreement or tense usage. Additionally, the modifying phrases provide clear information about which book is being referred to, making the meaning easily understandable.
1	The sentence "John has a fear of dogs" is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("John"), a helping verb ("has"), a noun that acts as a direct object ("fear"), and a prepositional phrase ("of dogs"). Each word is spelled correctly, and there are no missing or extra words. Additionally, the sentence follows standard English grammar rules for subject-verb agreement (the singular subject "John" matches with the singular helping verb "has") and punctuation (there is a period at the end of the sentence).
0	In this sentence, the verb "is" is being used incorrectly. Instead of saying "The building's the roof is leaking," it should be "The building's roof is leaking." This is because when we use a possessive noun (in this case, "building's") to show ownership or association, there is no need for another article ("the"). Therefore, the corrected version removes the second "the".
0	In this sentence, there is a mistake in the use of the possessive form. The correct phrase would be "the panther's coat," indicating that the coat belongs to the panther. Additionally, it is redundant to say "dark black." Instead, simply saying "the panther's coat is black" would suffice. So, the corrected sentence would be: "The panther's coat is black."
1	The sentence "Colin asked if they could get a mortgage" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "Colin" is the subject of the sentence and it is singular, so we use the auxiliary verb "asked." This form of the verb agrees with the singular subject. * "if they could get a mortgage" is a subordinate clause that functions as the direct object of the main clause. It contains the modal verb "could," which indicates possibility or permission. * The pronoun "they" refers to more than one person, but it can also be used as a gender-neutral singular pronoun to refer to a single individual whose gender is unknown or irrelevant. In this context, it is unclear whether "they" refers to multiple people or a single individual, but either way, its usage is grammatically acceptable.
0	This sentence contains a logical fallacy known as a "false cause" or "non sequitur." Just because the speaker saw someone get into a taxi does not mean that person committed a robbery later on. Therefore, the sentence is grammatically correct but semantically flawed.
1	The sentence "I know you eat asparagus." is grammatically correct. It consists of a subject ("I"), a verb ("know") that agrees with the subject, and an object clause starting with the conjunction "that" (although it's often omitted in informal speech), which contains another subject ("you") and its own predicate ("eat asparagus"). All elements are used appropriately for this structure to be considered grammatically accurate.
1	The sentence "John's drum will always bother me" is grammatically correct. Here's a breakdown of why it works: * "John's drum": This is a possessive form indicating that the drum belongs to John. It follows standard English grammar rules for forming possessives. * "will always bother": This part contains the future tense of the verb "to bother." In this context, it implies that the speaker anticipates continuous disturbance from John's drum in the future. * "me": This refers to the speaker who experiences discomfort due to John's drum. The structure and components of the sentence adhere to proper English syntax and usage, so I would rate this as being grammatically correct.
1	The sentence "An evil thought struck Dave" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "an evil thought," which is the thing that has been experienced by the indirect object "Dave." The verb "struck" indicates that the action came from outside of Dave (as opposed to something he deliberately did himself), so it's a valid way to describe having a sudden idea or realization come into one's mind. There are no grammatical errors or awkward phrasings in this sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "John," which is the person performing the action. The verb is "put," which describes the action that John is doing. The object of the sentence is "the book," which is what John is putting. Finally, "on the table" tells us where he put it. All of these elements together form a complete and grammatically correct sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence, "Phillip," is the person who performed the action described by the verb, "gave." The direct object of the sentence, "the medal," is the thing that was given. Finally, the indirect object of the sentence, "the soldier," is the person who received the medal. All of these elements are used correctly, so the sentence is grammatical.
0	The verb "thinks" requires a subject and a verb in its clause. Here, the clause is "Andy to eat salmon flavored candy bars." However, it's missing a helping verb, so it should be "Andy to eat salmon flavored candy bars" or "Andy eating salmon flavored candy bars". Additionally, there should be a preposition between "Andy" and "to", such as "Andy for eating" or "Andy to eat". So, a possible correction could be "Heidi thinks that Andy is supposed to eat salmon flavored candy bars" or "Heidi expects Andy to eat salmon flavored candy bars".
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Heidi," who is thinking something about someone else (Andy). We know this because of the word "that" introducing a clause expressing what Heidi's thoughts are regarding Andy ("Andy should eat salmon flavored candy bars"). There are no grammatical errors or awkward phrasings in this sentence; it follows standard English rules for syntax and usage.
1	The sentence "He danced" is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple present tense verb ("danced") that agrees with its subject ("he"). No errors in grammar, spelling, or punctuation can be found in this sentence.
0	The sentence "Did Calvin his homework?" is incorrect because it lacks proper verb agreement and word order. A correct version of this question would be "Did Calvin do his homework?" This formulation follows standard English grammar rules for subject-verb agreement (Calvin is singular; therefore, we use the singular form of the verb) and word order (the auxiliary verb comes before the main verb).
1	The sentence "Sylvia was slapping Jeff upside the head in martial arts class" is grammatically correct. It contains a complete thought and follows the standard structure of subject-verb-object. In this case, the subject is "Sylvia," the verb is "was slapping," and the object is "Jeff upside the head." Additionally, the phrase "in martial arts class" provides further context for the action. There are no apparent grammatical errors or awkward phrasings in this sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The conditional structure "If + past simple, would + infinitive" is used to express hypothetical or unlikely events in the present or future. In this case, "if I were a rich man" implies that the speaker is currently not rich but imagines what they would do if they were.
1	The sentence "If he were a rich man, he'd buy a diamond ring" is grammatically correct. It uses the subjunctive mood to express a hypothetical situation, which is appropriate in this context. Specifically, it employs the past subjunctive form of the verb "to be," namely "were," rather than the indicative form "was." This usage correctly indicates that the speaker is imagining or speculating about a condition (the subject being wealthy) that does not currently obtain. Therefore, I would classify this sentence as grammatically correct and assign it a score of 1.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "John," which is a noun in third person singular form. The verb that follows must agree in tense and number with the subject; here, the verb "is" agrees with the subject "John" because it's present tense and singular. Additionally, the phrase "likely to leave" indicates probability or expectation about John leaving, so the meaning is clear as well.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "the manager," which is a singular noun. The verb that agrees with a singular noun in simple present tense is "laughs." However, when we add the past tense suffix "-ed" to "laugh," it becomes "laughed," which still remains grammatically consistent as the past tense form of "laugh." Therefore, there is no mistake in this sentence.
0	The sentence "Was sunk." is not grammatically complete as it lacks a proper subject and context to make sense. A grammatically correct version of this statement could be something like "The ship was sunk," which provides a clear subject (the ship) for the verb tense used ("was sunk").
0	The sentence contains a mistake related to verb tense agreement. The past tense of the first auxiliary verb ("did") does not agree with the base form of the main verb ("think"). It should be either "Who do you think kissed the gorilla?" (present tense) or "Who did you think had kissed the gorilla?" (past perfect).
1	The sentence "Have you seen my model airplane collection?" is grammatically correct. The subject-auxiliary inversion ("have" before "you") indicates a question form, which is appropriate here. Additionally, all words are spelled correctly and punctuation is used appropriately.
1	The sentence "It seems that Lucy was mugged" is grammatically correct. Here's a breakdown of why: - The subject pronoun "it" is used correctly as the subject of the sentence. - The verb phrase "seems to be" is conjugated appropriately for third person singular present tense ("it") and expresses uncertainty or conjecture about the situation described by the subordinate clause "that Lucy was mugged." - The subordinating conjunction "that" introduces the subordinate clause, which contains the simple past tense verb "was mugged," indicating that the action took place in the past. This is appropriate because the event being referred to (Lucy being mugged) occurred prior to the time when the speaker is making the statement. Overall, the sentence follows standard English grammar rules and conventions, so it is considered grammatically correct.
1	The sentence "I ate a salad that was filled with lima beans" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * The subject of the sentence is "I," which is a pronoun referring to the speaker or writer. It agrees with the verb "ate." * The main verb of the sentence is "ate," which indicates past tense action. This verb agrees with its subject. * There is a relative clause modifying the noun phrase "a salad": "that was filled with lima beans." This clause contains two verbs: "was" (linking verb) and "filled" (transitive verb). Both verbs agree with their subjects ("that" and "salad," respectively), and both verbs follow standard rules for word order and form. * Overall, the sentence follows all relevant grammatical rules, including agreement between subject and verb, proper use of tenses, and clear syntax.
1	The sentence "There were four men arriving at the station when I pulled up" is grammatically correct. Here's why: - The subject of the sentence is "there," which functions as a placeholder indicating the existence or presence of something. In this case, it refers to the four men. - The verb "were" agrees with the plural subject "four men." It is the past tense form of "to be." - The direct object is "four men," which follows the transitive verb "arriving." - The prepositional phrase "at the station" modifies where the action (arriving) took place. - Finally, the clause "when I pulled up" provides additional information about the time frame of the main clause (the part before the comma). This type of subordinate clause starts with a conjunction such as "when" and can function within complex sentences without causing grammatical errors.
1	The sentence "Jean is reluctant to dance" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Jean," which is a proper noun and therefore capitalized. The verb of the sentence is "is," which agrees with the singular subject "Jean." The infinitive phrase "to dance" correctly follows the adjective "reluctant," indicating what Jean is unwilling or hesitant to do. Therefore, there are no grammatical errors in this sentence.
1	The sentence "I want her to dance" is grammatically correct. It consists of a subject ("I"), a verb ("want"), and an infinitive phrase ("her to dance") that functions as the direct object of the sentence. This structure is common in English for expressing desires or requests related to another person's actions.
1	The sentence "Jean persuaded Robert" is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple tense verb phrase ("persuaded") that links its subject ("Jean") to its object ("Robert"). Both proper nouns follow standard capitalization rules, and there are no spelling errors or awkward phrasings.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Jean," and the verb is "wants." The indirect object is "Bill," and the infinitive phrase "to do the Macarena" functions as the direct object. The sentence expresses a clear idea and all of its components follow standard rules for syntax and word usage in English.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "the children," which is a plural noun. The verb that agrees with a plural subject should also be in its plural form, so "admire" (third-person present tense) is used correctly here. Additionally, there are no any spelling errors or awkward phrasings, making it a proper sentence in standard English.
1	The sentence "Who has Peter talked with?" is grammatically correct. It is a question asking about the person or people that Peter has communicated with. The word order follows standard English syntax rules for questions, where the auxiliary verb (has) comes before the subject (Peter), followed by the past participle of the main verb (talked).
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Heidi," a proper noun that refers to a person. The verb of the sentence is "likes," which agrees with the singular subject in number (third-person present tense). The object of the sentence is "her violin." There are no grammatical errors or awkward phrasing, making it a complete and coherent sentence.
0	The pronoun used in this sentence does not agree with its antecedent. In the sentence, "John" is the subject who is doing the thinking, so the object of his thought ("Mary") should be referred to as "him," not "himself." The reflexive form "himself" would only make sense if John were also the direct object or indirect object of a verb (e.g., "John saw himself in the mirror"). Therefore, the correct version of this sentence would be: "John thinks that Mary loves him."
0	The sentence contains a minor error in pronoun reference. It would be more appropriate to say "Which pictures of him does John like?" or "Which pictures does John like of himself?" In the original sentence, using both "himself" (a reflexive pronoun) and "of himself" is redundant and incorrect.
0	The sentence contains a minor error in its verb tense agreement. Although "any" can be used as both singular and plural, it's more common to use "owls hunt mice" (plural) instead of "any owl hunts mice" (singular). This inconsistency creates confusion about whether we refer to one or multiple owls hunting mice.
0	This sentence contains a double negative ("didn't" and "no indefinite article"), which results in a logically inconsistent statement. The corrected version of the sentence could be either "Any man didn't eat dinner." (which would imply that some men ate dinner) or "No man ate dinner."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The modal verb "could" indicates possibility, which is used appropriately here. Additionally, subject-verb agreement is maintained throughout the sentence, as "pilot" (singular) matches with "could be" (also singular).
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. Here's a breakdown of the structure: * Everybody (pronoun referring to all individuals) who attended last week's huge rally (clause indicating the group of people being referred to)    * , (comma separating two independent clauses) * whoever they were (adverbial clause modifying the verb phrase "signed")    * signed (simple past tense of the transitive verb "sign," indicating completed action) * the petition (direct object of the sentence, receiving the action of signing) The coordinating conjunction "whoever" connects two independent clauses and creates a correlation between them. This construction effectively conveys that everyone who went to the rally also signed the petition, regardless of their individual identities or characteristics.
1	The sentence "Anybody who attended last week's huge rally signed the petition." is grammatically correct. Here are a few reasons why: * "Anybody" is a singular pronoun that refers to an unspecified person. It agrees with its verb form, "attended," which also shows agreement with a singular subject. * "Last week's" modifies "rally" correctly by showing when it occurred. * "Huge" functions as an adjective describing the size of the rally. * The gerund phrase "attending last week's huge rally" provides additional information about the people referred to by "anybody". * "Signed" is a past tense verb that indicates completed action and agrees with the plural noun "people." Overall, there are no grammatical errors or awkward phrasings in this sentence, so I would rate it as correct.
0	This sentence contains a common misconception about tigers but is grammatically correct. However, it's important to note that while many tigers do have orange fur and black stripes, there are also exceptions, such as white tigers with dark stripes. Therefore, using the word "any" may be misleading. A better way to phrase this would be: "Tigers typically have orange fur, marked with black stripes."
0	Albinism in animals (including tigers) is characterized by a lack of pigmentation, which results in white or pale skin and hair or feathers. Therefore, it's incorrect to say that any albino tiger has orange fur; instead, they would have white or pale fur without any markings or stripes due to their condition.
0	The sentence contains a vague pronoun reference. It's unclear what the subject of the second clause ("you") refers to - it could be anyone, not necessarily the person who was previously mentioned as having the ability to pick flowers. To make the sentence clearer, we might rephrase it by saying, for example, "You must pick any flower that you see."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "any pilot," which is modified by the prepositional phrase "on duty today." This limits the scope of the subject to only those pilots who are currently working. The verb of the sentence is "could be flying," which indicates possibility in the present tense. Overall, the structure and grammar of the sentence are correct, making it a valid English sentence.
1	The sentence "You may pick every flower, but leave a few for Mary." is grammatically correct. There are no spelling errors or punctuation mistakes. Additionally, the sentence structure follows standard English rules, making it easy to understand.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It contains two independent clauses ("The Dodgers beat the Red Sox" and "were beaten by the Giants") that are connected by a coordinating conjunction ("and"). Each clause has a subject ("The Dodgers," "they" or "was beaten" implies "they") and a verb ("beat," "were beaten"), so they can stand alone as complete thoughts. Additionally, each clause has a different subject and verb tense, which shows that these events happened separately (the Dodgers both did something and had something done to them).
1	The sentence "In which car was the man seen?" is grammatically correct. It consists of a preposition ("in"), an article ("which"), a noun ("car"), another article ("the"), a verb ("was"), another noun ("man"), and a past participle ("seen"). All of these words are used correctly, so there is no reason to mark the sentence as incorrect.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. Here's a breakdown of why: * "The man" is a noun phrase that serves as the subject of the sentence. It is grammatically correct. * "who Mary loves and Sally hates" is a relative clause modifying "the man." The verb in the relative clause agrees with its antecedent ("man") in number (singular). Also, the coordinating conjunction "and" connects two verb phrases ("loves" and "hates"), which refer to different subjects ("Mary" and "Sally"). Both clauses have the same structure and form, so they are parallel and balanced. * "computed" is the main verb of the sentence, agreeing with its singular subject "the man" in number. * Overall, the sentence has a clear meaning, expresses a complete thought, and follows standard English grammar rules.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It contains a relative clause ("which Mary made") that modifies the noun "kennel." The verb tense agrees within both clauses; the simple past tense of "has been stolen" corresponds to the action completed in the past described by "Mary made." Additionally, the pronoun "which" correctly refers to the antecedent "kennel," ensuring clarity for the reader.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no spelling errors or awkward phrasings that need to be corrected. Additionally, the sentence structure flows well and all of the words are used appropriately within their context. Therefore, I would classify this as a correct English sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. All of the words are spelled correctly, all of the punctuation marks are used properly, and there are no awkward or confusing phrasings. Additionally, each clause follows standard English syntax rules, making it easy to understand who did what and to whom.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It consists of a noun phrase ("the dog") and a verb phrase ("stole the turkey"). Both phrases contain appropriate determiners (the), nouns (dog, turkey) and tense indicators (stole). Therefore, it follows standard English syntax rules.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It consists of a noun phrase ("a tall building") which has a determiner ("a"), an adjective ("tall") modifying the noun "building," and the head noun itself ("building"). The sentence is missing a finite verb to form a complete thought or clause, but as it stands, it's still considered grammatical because all its components follow standard rules for English syntax within a noun phrase.
1	The sentence "This building is tall" is grammatically correct. The subject "this building" is singular and the verb "is" agrees with it. Additionally, the word "tall," which describes the height of the building, is appropriately used as a predicate adjective following a linking verb ("is").
1	The sentence "I like the book which you gave me." is grammatically correct. In this sentence, the relative clause "which you gave me" modifies the noun phrase "the book". This type of relative clause provides additional information about the antecedent (in this case, "book") and can be set off by a pair of commas to show that it's nonessential or restrictive if the meaning would still be clear without it. Here, no commas were used because the relative clause is essential for identifying which specific book the speaker likes.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("Captain Wentworth"), a verb ("wrote"), and an object ("a letter to Anne Elliot"). The sentence follows standard English syntax rules for word order (subject-verb-object) and punctuation.
0	The auxiliary verb "was" should be changed to "will" because it indicates a question about future action (asking whether Alison plans to come to the party). Also, there shouldn't be a space before the question mark. So, the corrected sentence would be: "She asked, 'Will Alison be coming to the party?'"
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The word "never" is used correctly as a negative adverb to modify the verb phrase "had been offended." Additionally, the past perfect tense ("had been") is appropriately used here because it describes an action completed before another past action. In this case, the action of realizing occurred after Sir Thomas's being offended.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Fanny," which is a noun that refers to a person. The verb tense used is past perfect ("had regretted"), indicating that Fanny's regret occurred before some other action or time in the past. The preposition "to" correctly introduces the indirect object of the sentence, which is "Aunt Norris." Overall, the sentence follows standard English grammar rules and is clear in its meaning.
1	The sentence "Knowing the country well, he took a short cut" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "Knowing the country well" is a participial phrase that modifies the subject of the sentence ("he"). It indicates that the person being referred to has knowledge about the country. This construction is grammatical and commonly used in English. * "He took a shortcut" is a simple clause that consists of a subject ("he") and a verb ("took"), followed by the object complement "a shortcut." This structure is also grammatically correct. Overall, the sentence is coherent and concise, making it a valid English expression.
1	The sentence "He left the train with somebody else's wallet in his pocket." is grammatically correct. It contains a main clause ("he left the train") and a dependent relative clause ("with somebody else's wallet in his pocket"). Both clauses contain the necessary subject-verb agreement and use appropriate verb tenses. Additionally, the possessive pronoun "somebody else's" correctly modifies the noun "wallet," indicating that it belongs to someone other than the person referred to as "he."
1	The sentence "Magnus went to Ireland" is grammatically correct. It consists of a proper noun (Magnus), a past tense verb (went), and a place name (Ireland). There are no spelling errors or awkward phrasings, so I would rate this sentence as 100% correct.
0	The sentence is missing a preposition after "send." A correct version would be "Who did John send the book to?" or "To whom did John send the book?"
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("the idea"), a verb ("dismayed"), and an object ("that the Dome was dull"). The sentence expresses that the idea of the dome being dull caused disappointment to the prime minister. There is no grammatical or spelling error present in this sentence.
0	In English, it is more common to say "He came right in without even knocking" instead of "Came right in he did without so much as a knock." The latter sentence is unnecessarily complicated and does not follow standard subject-verb-object word order.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Harriet," which is a noun that refers to a person. The verb in the sentence is "admired," which agrees with the singular subject in number (third-person present tense). Additionally, there is an object of the verb, which is "Mr. Knightley." Overall, the structure and usage of words follow standard English grammar rules.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It consists of a subject ("the book") and a predicate ("is boring"). The verb "is" agrees with its singular subject "book," and the adjective "boring" correctly describes the book.
1	The sentence "Ethel wishes to ask you some awkward questions" is grammatically correct. It consists of a noun phrase ("Ethel"), followed by a verb phrase ("wishes to ask") and another noun phrase ("you some awkward questions"). Each part of the sentence agrees with each other in number (singular) and tense (present), making it a well-formed English sentence.
1	The sentence "Emma made Harriet some food" is grammatically correct. Here's a breakdown of why it works: * "Emma" is the subject of the sentence, performing the action described by the verb. * "made" is the past tense of the verb "make," which indicates that Emma performed the action in the past. * "Harriet" is the indirect object, receiving the benefit of the action (in this case, getting food). * "some food" is the direct object, the thing being made for Harriet. The sentence has a clear structure and follows standard English grammar rules, so I would rate it as 1.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple sentence structure (subject + verb + object), where "the window" serves as the subject, "was broken" is the verb phrase, and "with a hammer" is a prepositional phrase that describes how the action was carried out. All elements are used appropriately, making it a proper sentence in English.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. Here's a breakdown of why: * "The fugitive" is a noun phrase that serves as the subject of the sentence. It consists of the definite article "the" and the noun "fugitive." * "lay" is the past tense of the verb "lie," which means to be or stay in a horizontal position. Since "fugitive" refers to a person here, it makes sense to use "lay" instead of "lie" because people can actively place themselves in a lying-down position (as opposed to things like books, for example). * "motionless" modifies "lay," describing how the fugitive was lying down - without any movement. * "in order to avoid discovery" is a prepositional phrase that explains why the fugitive was being motionless. It includes the infinitive "to avoid" followed by the gerund "discovery." Both work together to convey the intended meaning effectively. Overall, the sentence communicates its message clearly and concisely while adhering to grammatical rules.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "the guard," which is singular. The verb that agrees with a singular subject is "marched." The object of the verb is "the prisoners," which is plural. The prepositional phrase "round the yard" describes where the action took place. Therefore, there are no grammatical errors in this sentence.
1	The sentence "Frank Churchill crossed the street" is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("Frank Churchill"), a verb ("crossed") and a direct object ("the street"). Additionally, it follows standard English word order (Subject-Verb-Object) and has no spelling or punctuation errors. Therefore, I would classify this as a correctly written English sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Emma and Harriet," which is a compound noun phrase connected by the conjunction "and." The verb tense is past tense ("were attacked"), indicating that the action occurred yesterday. There are no other grammatical errors or awkward phrasings in this sentence.
1	The sentence "Fiona might be here by 5 o'clock" is grammatically correct. Here's a brief explanation of each part: * "Fiona": This is a proper noun (a name), so it does not need to follow any capitalization rules other than starting with a capital letter. * "might be": This auxiliary verb construction indicates possibility or uncertainty about Fiona's arrival time. It agrees with the subject "Fiona," which is singular. * "here": An adverb that describes location; in this case, it refers to the current place where the speaker is located. * "by 5 o'clock": A prepositional phrase indicating when Fiona may arrive. "By" means before or no later than, while "5 o'clock" specifies a particular time on the clock.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It contains two independent clauses joined by the conjunction "and". Each clause has its own subject ("I" and "of the opinion") and verb phrase ("am expecting" and "is a desirable one"). Additionally, the preposition "of" is correctly followed by the gerund form "the opinion", which functions as a noun in this context.
1	The sentence "Pat was awarded the Golden Fleece Award and very upset about it." is grammatically correct. There are no spelling errors or punctuation issues. Additionally, the sentence structure follows standard English syntax rules, where the subject (Pat) is followed by a verb phrase (was awarded) and two objects (the Golden Fleece Award and very upset). Therefore, I would rate this sentence as being grammatically correct.
0	The sentence contains two grammatical errors. First, "alienating" would be a more appropriate verb than "alienated" to maintain consistency with the present tense of "beating." Second, there is no possessive form or pronoun indicating ownership for "his dog," which requires an apostrophe (i.e., "his dog's"). A corrected version might read as follows: "Kim alienates cats and is beating his dog."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject "they" agrees with the verb "knew." The clause "that pictures of each other would be on sale" correctly follows the pattern of reported speech. Each word is spelled correctly, there are no missing or extra words, and the sentence conveys a complete thought.
0	The sentence contains a pronoun "Terry" which does not agree with its antecedent (the word or words that the pronoun refers to). In this case, there is no clear antecedent for "Terry." A possible correction could be: "Which articles did Terry fail to read before filing?" This would make it clear that we are talking about documents (articles) filed by someone named Terry.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "I", which is followed by a verb tense ("want") that agrees with the subject. There is also an infinitive phrase "to try" and another verb phrase "buy some whiskey". All words are spelled correctly and there are no missing or extra punctuation marks.
0	The present participle form of a verb (ending in -ing) must be preceded by an auxiliary verb such as 'is', 'am', or 'are' if it follows another verb in the simple present tense. In this case, 'goes' is incorrect because it requires no auxiliary verb when used alone. It would need to say 'She goes AND buys some whiskey,' or better yet for proper parallel structure, 'She goes to buy some whiskey.'
0	The subject of the sentence "Kim and Terry" is plural (consisting of two people), so it requires a plural verb to agree with it. In this case, the verb "is" should be changed to "are", making the corrected sentence "Kim and Terry are happy."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Kim," and the verb is "gave." The direct objects of the verb are "a dollar" and "a dime," which are properly modified by the prepositional phrases "to Bobbie" and "to Jean," respectively. There are no grammatical errors or awkward phrasing in this sentence.
1	The sentence "This girl in the red coat will put a picture of Bill in the mailbox and on your desk before tomorrow" is grammatically correct. The subject "this girl" is followed by the verb phrase "will put," which is in the future tense and agrees with the subject. The direct object "a picture of Bill" follows the verb, and the prepositional phrases "in the mailbox" and "on your desk" provide more information about where the action takes place. Finally, the time frame for the action is specified as "before tomorrow." All elements of the sentence are used correctly and work together to convey a clear meaning.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It has a clear subject ("the girl in the red coat"), verb ("will put"), and object ("a picture of Bill") for each clause. Additionally, there is no misplaced punctuation or misspelled words. Therefore, it receives a score of 1.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("this girl in the red coat"), a verb ("will put"), and an object ("a picture of Bill"). Additionally, it includes clear temporal information about when the action will take place ("before tomorrow"). There are no spelling or punctuation errors, making the sentence fully coherent and understandable to native speakers.
1	The sentence "Ann bought a first edition of Richard III for $1000." is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("Ann"), a verb ("bought"), and an object ("a first edition of Richard III"). Additionally, it includes necessary prepositional phrases ("of Richard III" and "for $1000") that provide more information about what was bought and how much it cost. There are no grammatical errors or awkward phrasings, so the sentence receives a score of 1.
1	The sentence "John became deadly afraid of flying" is grammatically correct. Here's a breakdown: * "John" is a proper noun that serves as the subject of the sentence. It refers to a specific person named John. * "became" indicates a change in state or condition over time, which shows causality between the subject and predicate. * "deadly" functions as an adverb modifying the adjective "afraid," emphasizing the intensity of fear experienced by John. * "afraid" is an adjective describing John's emotional response. * "of flying" is a prepositional phrase acting as the object of the verb "was afraid." This part of the sentence describes what John developed a strong fear towards.
1	The sentence "What John promised is to be gentle" is grammatically correct, although it might sound a bit awkward or formal to native speakers. A more common way to phrase this idea would be "John promised to be gentle." However, there's nothing technically wrong with the original sentence, so I will still mark it as correct.
0	The sentence contains a minor error known as a question fragment. A complete sentence requires both a subject ("Henri") and a predicate or verb phrase ("wants to buy"). In addition, there needs to be some indication of what kind of books Henri is looking for; otherwise, it's unclear how one could provide an appropriate response to his query. Here's a corrected version of the sentence: "Henri wants to buy which books about cooking?" or "Which books about cooking does Henri want to buy?"
1	The sentence "I will fix the computer for Carol" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * The subject of the sentence is "I," which is a pronoun that refers to the speaker. It agrees with the verb "will fix." * The main verb in the present tense is "will fix" (future tense), indicating that the action will take place in the future. * There is a direct object "the computer," which receives the action of the verb. * Finally, there is a prepositional phrase "for Carol," which shows who the action is being done for. Overall, all parts of the sentence work together well, making it grammatically correct.
1	The sentence "Smith loaned a valuable collection of manuscripts to the library" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Smith," which is the person performing the action. The verb "loaned" indicates that Smith performed the action in the past. The direct object of the sentence is "a valuable collection of manuscripts," which is what was loaned. Finally, "to the library" tells us where the action was directed. Therefore, there are no grammatical errors in this sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple sentence with subject-verb-object word order: "The paper" (subject) is being cut (verb) "by Mary" (object). There are no spelling errors or awkward phrasings that would make it incorrect.
1	The sentence "It was from six to nine or it took place from six to nine" is grammatically correct. Both clauses of the sentence, "it was from six to nine" and "it took place from six to nine," use the preposition "from" followed by a time expression (in this case, numbers representing hours) and ending with the word "to." This structure is commonly used when expressing ranges of time in English. Therefore, there are no errors in grammar, usage, or syntax that would warrant returning a value other than 1 for this input.
1	The sentence "Suddenly, there arrived two inspectors from the INS" is grammatically correct. However, it could be improved for readability by using a more active construction such as "Suddenly, two inspectors from the INS arrived." Nonetheless, since the original sentence is grammatically valid, I will still assign it a score of 1.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It consists of two independent clauses ("The soup cooks" and "thickens") that are connected by a comma to form a compound sentence. Each clause contains a subject ("the soup") and a verb ("cooks," "thickens"). Additionally, there is no ambiguity or confusion caused by the use of the comma, as it clearly separates the two clauses. Therefore, the sentence is grammatically sound.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence ("I") is the person performing the action, which is expressed by the verb "gave." The indirect object of the sentence is "the charity," which receives the direct object "money." All elements are used correctly and follow standard English grammar rules.
1	The sentence "John asked." is grammatically correct. It consists of a proper noun (John) followed by a verb in past tense (asked). No errors can be found here.
0	The sentence "I saw even the student" is grammatically incorrect because of the placement of the word "even." In this context, it would be more appropriate to say "I even saw the student," indicating that seeing the student was a notable or unexpected event. Alternatively, if the intended meaning is that the speaker saw every single student, the sentence could be corrected as "I saw even all the students" or "I saw every student."
0	This sentence is grammatically incorrect because it lacks a main verb that connects "John" and "Mary." The intended meaning seems to be something like "John whispered that Mary had left," but as written, there is no clear relationship between the two actions described. In addition, without additional context or punctuation, the sentence could also potentially mean that John whispered to Mary, who then left; however, even if we interpret the sentence this way, it would still be missing necessary words for clarity (e.g., "John whispered to Mary and she left").
0	In English, we typically use if-clauses to express a situation where someone is wondering about something. The word "that" is also unnecessary here. A correct version of the sentence would be: "Mary wonders whether Bill will come."
0	The verb "will" indicates future tense, but it needs to be followed by a base form of the verb (in this case, "theater" should be "go"). A correct version would be "Sophie will go to the theater."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of both clauses ("John") is the same, so there's no need for a conjunction to connect them. Additionally, the past tense verb forms ("finished" and "drank") agree with their subjects in number (singular) and time (past). There are also no spelling or punctuation errors in this sentence.
0	The subject of the sentence, "Herself," is a reflexive pronoun that refers back to the subject of the sentence. This implies that the subject is performing the action on itself, but in this case, "likes" requires an object, which would be another person or thing. Therefore, it does not make sense for "herself" to be the subject here. A possible correction could be "Mary's mother likes herself."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "each of the boys," which is plural. The verb that agrees with a plural subject should also be plural, so "fought" is the correct form to use here. Additionally, the preposition "with" indicates a conflict or disagreement between two parties, making "some of the other boys" a suitable object for the sentence.
0	The pronoun used to refer back to the subject of a sentence should match its grammatical number (singular or plural) and gender (masculine, feminine, neuter). In this case, the object of the verb "likes" should be the reflexive pronoun corresponding to "John's mother," which would be "herself." Therefore, the corrected sentence should read: "John's mother likes herself."
0	The pronoun used for the subject of the sentence should match the grammatical gender of the noun it refers to. In this case, the subject of the sentence "Mary" is female but the pronoun used "himself" implies a male subject. A more appropriate way to phrase the sentence would be "Mary revealed herself to John."
1	The sentence "Mary believes that Bill saw himself" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "Mary" is the subject of the main clause, and it is a proper noun, so there is no error here. * "believes" is the verb of the main clause, and it agrees with the singular subject "Mary." It also shows the present tense, which fits the context. * "that" introduces a subordinate clause, and it functions as a conjunction to connect two clauses together. * "Bill" is the subject of the subordinate clause, and it is a proper noun, so there is no error here. * "saw" is the verb of the subordinate clause, and it agrees with the singular subject "Bill." It also shows the past tense, which implies that the action happened before another action or time frame. * "himself" is a reflexive pronoun that refers back to the antecedent "Bill," indicating that Bill was both the doer and the receiver of the action.
1	The sentence "John heard that they criticized themselves" is grammatically correct. The subject of the main clause is "John," which is a singular noun. The verb "heard" agrees with the singular subject "John." The subordinate clause "they criticized themselves" also has a plural subject "they" and the corresponding verb form "criticized." Therefore, both clauses follow the agreement rule between subjects and verbs, making the entire sentence grammatical.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence, "Mary," is clearly identified, and the verb tense is consistent throughout the sentence. Additionally, the subordinating conjunction "that" introduces a dependent clause ("she is smart") which provides additional information about the subject's thoughts or beliefs. Overall, the sentence is clear, concise, and follows standard English grammar rules.
1	The sentence "Henry found that Bill is sad" is grammatically correct. It consists of a main clause ("Henry found") and a subordinate clause ("that Bill is sad"). Both clauses contain simple present-tense verbs ("finds," "is"), which agree in number with their subjects ("Henry," "Bill"). Additionally, there are no punctuation or spelling errors, making the sentence grammatically sound.
0	The sentence contains a small error in verb tense agreement. The present participle ("considers") must agree in tense with its subject ("John"), so it should be parallel with the verb form used to describe Mary's feelings about herself. Therefore, we need to use the past participle instead: "John considered himself proud of Mary." Alternatively, if John still has those same feelings, we can say "John considers himself to be proud of Mary" or simply "John is proud of Mary".
0	The correct form of this sentence should be "You should sit there before." In this corrected version, "there" comes after "sit," which is grammatically correct because it indicates where the subject ("you") should sit. Additionally, placing "before" last emphasizes its importance as a time adverb.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject ("a nurse") is singular, so the verb must also be singular. In this case, "is" is used correctly as the third-person singular present tense of the verb "to be." Additionally, the word "available" functions appropriately as an adjective describing the state or condition of the nurse.
0	The verb "hopes" requires a singular noun as its subject, but "everyone" is plural. Additionally, the indirect object "everyone" needs to be preceded by "for." A correct version of this sentence would be "Everyone hopes for everyone else to get enough sleep," or simply "Everyone wants others to sleep well."
1	The sentence "Everyone hopes that he will sleep" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "Everyone" is a singular, gender-neutral pronoun used to refer to all people collectively. It requires a singular verb form such as "hopes." In this case, "everyone" serves as the subject of the main clause. * "that" introduces a subordinate clause functioning as the direct object of the main clause. * "he" refers back to "everyone," which although grammatically singular, can be interpreted inclusively here to mean anyone regardless of their gender identity. * "will sleep" is a present tense verb phrase expressing future time reference. Since it follows "he," it agrees with the third person singular subject. Therefore, no grammatical errors exist in this sentence.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It uses the past perfect tense ("remembered") to indicate that the action of remembering happened after another past action ("giving"). This creates a clear chronological sequence of events and conveys the intended meaning effectively. Therefore, there are no errors in grammar or usage that would require correction.
0	The verb "promise" requires a base form of the verb that follows it in a clause. Therefore, the sentence should be "John promises Mary to shave himself." instead of "John promise Mary to shave himself."
1	The sentence "John convinced Bill that Mary should sleep" is grammatically correct. It contains a main clause ("John convinced Bill") and a subordinate clause ("that Mary should sleep"). Both clauses contain proper subject-verb agreement, and the verb tense remains consistent throughout the sentence. Additionally, there are no misspelled words or incorrect word choices, making it a valid sentence in standard English.
0	This sentence is grammatically incorrect due to a missing conjunction between the two clauses "I saw Bill" and "you did so Mary." A proper correction would be "I saw Bill while you did something," or "I saw Bill when you did so Mary." The lack of a clear subject for the second clause also adds confusion.
0	The verb tense needs to be consistent throughout the sentence. In this case, the past simple tense ("did") should match with its corresponding verb in the subject-verb agreement form, which would be "gave" instead of "was give". A corrected version of the sentence could read as follows: "What Mary did was give Bill a book." Alternatively, for passive voice: "What Bill was given by Mary was a book."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple tense verb phrase ("sniffed") and its subject ("bears"). No words or phrases seem to be missing from the sentence. Additionally, there is no incorrect word usage or other error that would warrant changing the score.
1	The sentence "to steal talismans from witches is dangerous" is grammatically correct. It consists of an infinitive phrase "to steal talismans," a prepositional phrase "from witches," and a linking verb "is" followed by the adjective "dangerous." There are no grammatical errors or awkward phrasing that would make it difficult for a native speaker to understand. Therefore, I would rate this sentence as being grammatically correct and assign it a score of 1.
0	The sentence "Anson demonized" is grammatically incomplete as it lacks a direct object or an infinitive verb to complete its meaning. For instance, it could be corrected to "Anson demonized the proposal," or "Anson demonized running in public places." Without additional context or information, it's impossible to determine what Anson might have demonized, making the original sentence incorrect.
0	The verb "kick" requires a singular or plural object to complete its meaning. In this case, "yourselves" is a reflexive pronoun that refers back to the subject of the sentence. However, since we typically use "yourself" as the reflexive pronoun for second-person singular subjects (e.g., "you kicked yourself"), using "yourselves" instead suggests that there is more than one person involved. Therefore, the sentence is grammatically incorrect if it's meant to refer to only one person. If it's meant to refer to multiple people, then the sentence would be correct, but without additional context, I am assuming the former interpretation.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. Here's a breakdown of why: * "The" is a definite article used to refer to a specific book. * "I" refers to the speaker or writer. * "said" is the past tense of say, indicating that the speaker previously made a statement about the book. * "that" introduces a clause ("that I'd never read") which functions as the direct object of the verb "said". * "I'd" is a contraction for "I had", indicating that the speaker had expressed a previous intention regarding the book. * "never" indicates that the speaker had no plans to read the book in the past. * "read" is the base form of the verb, indicating an action completed in the past (in this case, the intended action).
0	The verb "demonized" needs to agree with its subject in number, so it should be either "demonizes" (if Anson is singular) or "demonize" (if Anson is plural). Additionally, there seems to be a missing preposition before "up." A possible correction could be "Anson demonized the situation by raising it up the Khyber," assuming that "the Khyber" refers to something specific previously mentioned in context.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The phrase "might be going" expresses possibility in the future tense, which correctly conveys uncertainty about attending the party.
0	The sentence "Kick you!" is grammatically incorrect because it lacks a subject. A complete sentence must have both a subject and a predicate (verb). In this case, there is only a verb ("kick") but no clear subject indicating who or what will be doing the kicking. To make this sentence grammatically correct, consider adding a proper subject such as "I kick you" or changing it to an imperative form without needing an explicit subject, e.g., "Kick (me)!"
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Jason", who is performing the action of persuading. The verb "persuaded" is conjugated correctly for the singular third-person subject. The indirect object is "the doctor," which receives the direct object "to treat Medea." The infinitive phrase "to treat Mededa" functions as the direct object of the sentence, indicating what was persuaded. Overall, the sentence has a clear structure and proper syntax.
0	The sentence contains a small error in subject-verb agreement. A more grammatically correct version would be "Who **did you** get an accurate description **from**?" or "Who have you gotten an accurate description of?" depending on context and intended tense.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "The Peter" is a valid way to refer to a specific person named Peter when there may be multiple Peters being discussed. It functions as a definite article (the) plus a name. * "we all" refers to a group of people that includes the speaker and others. * "like" indicates a positive feeling or attitude towards Peter. * "was" agrees in number with the singular subject "Peter." * "at the party" tells us where Peter was located.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "The" is correctly used as a definite article before the noun "government." * "Government's" indicates possession, meaning that the fines are being imposed by the government. * "Imposition" is a valid word choice here, referring to the act of making something be done or accepted, especially by using one's authority. * "A" is correctly used as an indefinite article before the noun "fine," indicating that any fine would fit this description.
1	The sentence "Did Athena help us?" is grammatically correct. It consists of a question tag ("did") followed by the subject ("Athena"), the auxiliary verb "help" (in past tense), and the object "us". All words are spelled correctly, and there are no punctuation or agreement errors. Therefore, I would classify this as a correct English sentence.
1	The sentence "You wanted to meet the man I saw" is grammatically correct. Here's a breakdown of why: - "You" is a subject pronoun used as the direct address. - "wanted" is the past tense of the verb "to want." It agrees with the subject "you," indicating that the action was completed in the past. - "to meet" forms an infinitive phrase acting as the object complement for the verb "wanted." This part tells us what the subject "you" intended or desired to do. - "the" is a definite article specifying which particular noun (in this case, "man") is being referred to. - "man" is a singular countable noun referring to an adult male human being. - "I" is a first-person singular subject pronoun serving as the subject of the relative clause "I saw." - "saw" is the simple past tense form of the verb "to see." It indicates that the speaker performed the act of seeing a specific person (the man) in the past.
0	The verb "demonize" means to portray someone or something as evil. It requires a reflexive pronoun (e.g., himself, herself) if the subject of the sentence performs the action on itself. In this case, since Anson is performing the action on David, there's no need for a reflexive pronoun. However, it still sounds odd because we usually don't use "demonize" casually like that. A more appropriate way would be "Anson criticized David every day."
0	The sentence contains a spelling mistake. The word "programme" should be spelled as "program." In American English, it's spelled "program," while in British English, it can also be spelled "programme" with two 'm's. However, in this case, since the context suggests that the radio station is a British one (Radio 4), using the American spelling would make the sentence incorrect according to British English conventions.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Medea," which is the person denying something. The verb is "denied," which indicates that the action being described happened in the past. The object of the sentence is "poisoning the phoenix," which is what Medea is denying having done. The sentence has a clear structure and follows all standard rules for English syntax.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. There are no spelling errors or awkward phrasing. Additionally, all of the words fit together logically to convey a clear meaning. In this case, we learn that someone hid an elixir (a magical potion) inside a hole located underground.
0	The sentence "Extremely frantically, Anson danced at Trade" is grammatically incorrect because "Trade" is a vague object for the verb "danced." It's unclear what or where Anson was dancing, making it difficult to determine the intended meaning of the sentence. To make the sentence grammatically correct, consider specifying the location (e.g., "at the trade show") or adding a direct object that clarifies the action being performed by Anson (e.g., "with joy").
0	The sentence contains multiple errors that make it difficult to understand. The subject of the sentence ("you") has no clear action or verb associated with it, making it unclear what is being asked. Additionally, the phrase "who Medea gave" lacks a proper object; we need to know what Medea gave to someone for the question to be complete and grammatically correct. A possible correction could be: "What (or whom) did Medea give?" This version provides a clearer structure while maintaining the intended meaning.
1	The sentence "It's Anson that I like" is grammatically correct. Here, "it's" is a contraction of "it is," which serves as the subject of the sentence. "Anson" functions as the direct object, receiving the action of the verb "like." This construction is commonly used to express a preference or fondness for someone or something. Therefore, there are no grammatical errors in this sentence.
0	The verb "tried" in this context requires a direct object, but there is no noun or pronoun directly following it that can serve as its object. Additionally, the preposition "to" should come before the infinitive "poison", so the correct form of the sentence would be: "Medea tried **to** poison her children."
0	The verb tense used in this sentence is incorrect. In the first part of the sentence, "I felt" indicates a past action or emotion. However, in the second part of the sentence, "I know" implies present knowledge. To make the sentence grammatically correct, it should be changed to either "I feel that I knew you" (if referring to a past relationship) or "I feel that I know you" (if implying current familiarity).
0	The sentence contains a double subject ("he" and "can"), which is incorrect. It should be either "Will he do it?" or "Can he do it?" depending on whether the emphasis is on the willingness to perform the action (will) or the ability to perform the action (can).
0	The sentence "I ate that she was happy" is grammatically incorrect because it uses the wrong word to connect its two clauses. Instead of "that," a conjunction such as "because" or "while" would be appropriate here. Additionally, the verb tense in the second clause ("was happy") does not agree with the subject "she." It should instead be "is happy" if referring to her current state. A corrected version could read "I saw that she is happy" (assuming the speaker sees her happiness in the present) or "I ate while she was happy" (if the eating occurred during a time when she was happy).
1	The sentence "Anson believed himself to be handsome" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "Anson" is a proper noun and serves as the subject of the sentence. It is correctly spelled and capitalized. * "believed" is the past tense of the verb "to believe," which takes the direct object "himself." * "Himself" is a reflexive pronoun that refers back to the subject "Anson." Reflexive pronouns indicate that the subject performs the action on itself. * Overall, the sentence follows standard English syntax rules and has no grammatical errors.
1	The sentence "We arrived about six o'clock" is grammatically correct. The word "about" is used correctly as a preposition to indicate approximately. Additionally, "six o'clock" is a common phrase that means the time when the hour hand of a clock points directly upwards (12 on a 12-hour analog clock). Therefore, there are no grammatical errors or awkward phrasing in this sentence.
0	The verb tense used in this sentence is incorrect for the intended meaning. "Gilgamesh is having fought" suggests that the action of fighting a dragon is currently ongoing and was also ongoing in the past, but there's no mention of when or how long the action took place. It would be more appropriate to use simple past tense ("Gilgamesh fought the dragon") if the intent is to convey that the action has been completed. Alternatively, one could say "Gilgamesh has been fighting the dragon" if the intention is to indicate that the action started in the past and continues up until now without interruption.
0	The reflexive pronoun "himself" is incorrect in this context. Instead of modifying a noun or pronoun as its antecedent (as in "Anson saw himself in the mirror"), it stands alone as if it were a subject ("Himself was happy"). This error creates confusion about who is being referred to. To fix the problem, one could say either "Anson thought he was happy," or replace "thought" with "considered" for greater emphasis on self-assessment: "Anson considered himself happy."
1	The sentence "Fortunately Hermione passed biology" is grammatically correct. It consists of a subordinating conjunction ("fortunately") that introduces an adverbial clause modifying the main clause "Hermione passed biology." Both clauses contain simple subjects and predicates, making for a complete sentence that expresses a single idea or action. No grammatical errors can be found here.
0	The sentence contains a double negative ("might not" and "but"), which can lead to confusion about the intended meaning. To convey negation only once, we could say either "I might go to the party or I might stay home to wash my hair" (showing two possibilities) or "I am not going to the party because I will be washing my hair instead" (stating one certain choice).
0	The reflexive pronoun used here (myself) does not agree with the subject of the sentence (I). Instead, a regular object pronoun should be used. A corrected version would read: "I thought he liked me."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It consists of a subject ("the butler"), an auxiliary verb ("sent"), and an object ("the poison"). Additionally, it contains a prepositional phrase ("to Dinah") that modifies the verb by telling us who received the poison. All of these elements combine to form a complete thought or idea, making it a well-formed sentence in English.
0	This sentence contains redundant phrasing that can be simplified for clarity and coherence. The phrase "to appear to seem" is repetitive because both verbs ("appear" and "seem") convey a similar meaning - that of giving the impression of being something. Therefore, we can remove one of these words without changing the intended meaning of the sentence. A clearer version could be: "Jason appears to be sick." or "Jason seems to be sick." However, since the original sentence includes both verbs, it creates confusion and ambiguity, making it less effective in conveying its intended message.
0	The sentence "What did you ask who saw?" is grammatically incorrect because it lacks a clear subject and verb agreement. A more appropriate way to phrase the question would be "Who did you ask what they saw?" or "What did you ask (someone) when you asked them about seeing something?"
1	The sentence "We linguists love to argue" is grammatically correct. Here's why: - The subject of the sentence, "we," is a pronoun that refers to a group of people, including the speaker or writer. In this case, it specifically refers to linguists. - The verb "love" is correctly conjugated for the plural first-person pronoun "we." It indicates that the action (loving) is done by the group referred to as "we." - The infinitive phrase "to argue" functions as the direct object of the sentence. It tells us what we linguists love doing. Overall, the structure of the sentence is clear and concise, making it easy to understand. Therefore, I would rate this sentence as grammatically correct and assign it a score of 1.
0	The sentence "He can will go" is grammatically incorrect because it contains two auxiliary verbs ("can" and "will") that perform similar functions, resulting in redundancy and awkwardness. In standard English usage, one or the other verb would be sufficient to convey the intended meaning. A possible correction could be "He can go" or "He will go," depending on whether the emphasis is on his ability or intention to go.
0	The sentence "How fierce the battle?" is not grammatically correct because it lacks a necessary auxiliary verb to form a question. A more appropriate way to phrase this question would be "How fierce was the battle?" or "How fierce is the battle?" depending on the intended context.
0	The sentence contains a mistake known as a question fragment. It sets up a question but does not include one. A corrected version could be: "Which king did you ask about?" or "Which city did you ask me about having been invaded by?"
0	The phrase "some disgruntled old pigs" does not make sense in this context as it implies that the pigs themselves are disgruntled, which is unlikely since they are objects being eaten by humans. A more appropriate way to express this idea would be "some old pigs that humans love to eat." Additionally, using "those" before "ditches" suggests a specific group of ditches has been previously mentioned or established, but no such reference exists in the provided sentence. Using "these" instead may help clarify the meaning if there was prior mention of particular ditches.
0	In this sentence, the subject ("that banana") and verb ("is eating") are incorrectly arranged. The proper structure of a simple sentence requires that the subject comes before the predicate (verb). Moreover, only animate beings can eat; therefore, it's illogical to say that 'a banana eats a monkey'. A more appropriate formulation would be: "The monkey is eating that banana."
0	The sentence lacks necessary context to be considered grammatically correct. In its current form, it's unclear what or who is being referred to by the pronoun "them." A complete sentence requires a subject and predicate; in this case, both noun and verb components are missing. For example, a more complete version of this sentence could be "Burn the papers!" or "The crowd decided to burn them," which provide clear subjects and verbs for understanding the intended meaning.
1	The sentence "It stinks that Aphrodite is omnipotent" is grammatically correct. There are no spelling errors, punctuation errors, or grammatical errors in the sentence. Additionally, the word choice is appropriate for formal writing, and the sentence is clear and concise. Therefore, I would classify this sentence as being grammatically correct and assign it a score of 1.
1	The sentence "Agamemnon seems to be a maniac" is grammatically correct. Here's why: - The subject of the sentence is "Agamemnon," which is a proper noun referring to a character from Greek mythology. Proper nouns are always capitalized. - The verb in the present tense is "seems." This verb agrees with the third person singular subject (i.e., "Agamemnon") because it has an added -s at the end. - The predicate adjective "to be a maniac" describes the subject by giving more information about its state or condition. Predicate adjectives follow linking verbs such as "be," "seem," and "appear" and modify the subject directly. In this case, "maniac" functions as an adjective that tells us something about Agamemnon's behavior or personality.
1	The sentence "Will Anson come to the party?" is grammatically correct. It consists of a main verb ("will come") and its subject ("Anson"), as well as a prepositional phrase ("to the party"). All words are spelled correctly and used appropriately for standard English. Additionally, there is no punctuation or agreement error present.
1	The sentence "I wondered who Medea had poisoned" is grammatically correct. Here's a breakdown of why that is: - "I wondered" is a verb phrase in the past tense indicating that the speaker was curious about something in the past. - "who" functions as a relative pronoun introducing a clause (had poisoned) to identify which person or thing is being referred to by the noun ("Medea"). - "Medea" is a proper noun referring to a character from Greek mythology known for her acts of vengeance against those who wronged her. - "had poisoned" is a verb phrase in the past perfect tense, used here to indicate that some action occurred prior to another action in the past. In this case, the action of poisoning happened before someone started wondering about it. Overall, all elements of the sentence work together well to convey a clear meaning.
1	The sentence "I inquired when could we leave" is grammatically correct. However, it may sound more natural to say or write "I asked when we could leave." Both "inquire" and "ask" can mean to seek information about something, but "ask" is more commonly used in everyday language than "inquire". Additionally, using "when could we" as a single unit instead of separating them into two different clauses makes the sentence flow better. Nonetheless, since both versions are technically correct, I will still give it a score of 1 for grammatical accuracy.
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect because it lacks a clear subject and verb agreement. It's unclear who or what was doing the kicking, and to whom or what they were kicking. A corrected version of the sentence could be "They kicked the ball" or "The dogs kicked him," depending on the intended meaning.
0	The verb "ate" should be in present tense to match the subject "monkey." The past tense of eat is "ate," but the correct form for present tense is "eats." Therefore, the corrected sentence would read: "The monkey eats the banana."
0	The sentence contains a double modal error. In English grammar, we cannot use two modals together in one sentence. Therefore, the corrected version of the sentence should be either "I would like to swim" or "I could swim."
1	The sentence "I kicked myself" is grammatically correct. It consists of a single clause with a subject ("I") and a verb ("kicked"). The meaning of the sentence can vary depending on context (e.g., it could mean that the speaker physically kicked themselves or used the phrase metaphorically to express self-reproach), but its grammatical structure is correct regardless.
0	This sentence is incorrect because a bookcase is an inanimate object and cannot run. The verb "run" typically refers to motion undertaken by animate objects or living beings. Incorrect subject-verb agreement also contributes to the error in this sentence. A more appropriate verb choice for an inanimate subject such as "bookcase" would be "stood." Therefore, a grammatically correct version of the original sentence might read, "The bookcase stood," assuming no additional context exists that warrants another verb tense or form.
1	The sentence "I shaved myself" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "I", which is the person performing the action described by the verb "shaved". In this case, "shaved" is the past tense form of the verb "shave", indicating that the action was completed in the past. The reflexive pronoun "myself" is used correctly to indicate that the subject performed the action on themselves. Therefore, the sentence is grammatically correct.
0	The phrase "muscle bound" is being used incorrectly here; it's actually an adjective that means having tight or inflexible muscles due to excessive weightlifting. In this context, I believe what was intended was for "muscle-bound" to be a noun referring to someone who has large muscles (e.g., "Anson became muscular"). However, since "muscle-bound" is still commonly recognized as an adjective, using it as a standalone noun would likely cause confusion among native speakers of English. A more appropriate way to express this idea might be something along the lines of "Anson developed big muscles."
