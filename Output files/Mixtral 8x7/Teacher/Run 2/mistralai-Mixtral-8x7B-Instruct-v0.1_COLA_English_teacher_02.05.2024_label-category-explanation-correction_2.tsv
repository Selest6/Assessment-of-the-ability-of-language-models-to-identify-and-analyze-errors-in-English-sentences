label	category	explanation	correction
1	Syntax	The sentence follows the rules for English syntax. It has a subject ("the sailors"), a verb ("rode"), and an object ("the breeze"). The modifying prepositional phrase "clear of the rocks" provides additional information about where the action took place.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "The weights made the rope stretch over the pulley" is grammatically correct. The subject "weights" is followed by a verb "made", and then we have the object "the rope". The phrase "stretch over the pulley" describes what action the object underwent due to the subject's actions.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically correct because it follows the rules for word order and structure in English. It has a subject ("the mechanical doll"), a verb ("wriggled"), and an object ("itself"). The reflexive pronoun "itself" correctly refers back to the subject "the mechanical doll".	The sentence is already correct.
1	Semantics	This sentence is semantically correct because it conveys a logical relationship between two hypothetical events. The first clause states that if the subject had eaten more, and the second clause suggests that as a result, they would want less.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Semantics	The sentence contains a contradiction because if someone eats the most, they would typically want more food rather than the least. It's illogical for someone who consumes the most to desire the smallest amount.	The sentence should be rephrased as follows: "As you eat the most, you want the least (food)," but even then it remains semantically questionable since people usually associate eating with wanting more food rather than less.
0	Syntax	This sentence contains a syntactic error known as a double negative. Specifically, the word "would" is used twice with the negations "the more" and "less," resulting in unclear meaning. A corrected version could be: "The more you want, the less you will eat."	The more you want, the less you will eat.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a syntactic error known as a split infinitive. In traditional grammar, it is considered incorrect to split an infinitive verb by inserting another word between "to" and the base form of the verb. Therefore, the sentence should be restructured to avoid splitting the infinitive. A possible correction would be: "I demand that the more John eats, the more he pays."	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The issue with this sentence lies in its syntax, specifically with subject-verb agreement. In this case, there are two subjects ("Mary" and "she") but only one verb ("gets"). To fix this error, we can combine both subjects into a single noun phrase and use a plural form of the verb: "Mary and she get depressed when listening to the Grateful Dead." Alternatively, if we want to keep the original structure, we need to revise it slightly by adding a conjunction between the clauses: "Mary listens to the Grateful Dead, and then she gets depressed."	Mary and she get depressed when listening to the Grateful Dead. OR Mary listens to the Grateful Dead, and then she gets depressed.
1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically well-formed as it follows the structure of a comparative correlation. It has two clauses connected by the conjunction 'and' where both clauses have parallel structures. In addition, there is no misplaced modifier, agreement issues, or other grammatical errors that would make the sentence unacceptable.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	This sentence is syntactically correct because it follows the rules for forming a grammatical English sentence. It has a subject ("the higher stakes"), a verb ("are"), and an object complement ("lower his expectations"). The word order is also correct, making the meaning clear.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows the standard structure of a comparative sentence where two clauses are compared using words such as "the more" and "the less". In this case, the clause "Fred is obnoxious" is being compared to the clause "you should pay attention to him", with the comparison indicating that there is an inverse relationship between the level of Fred's obnoxiousness and the amount of attention paid to him.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "John was lots more obnoxious than Fred" is grammatically correct. Although some people might prefer using "a lot" instead of "lots," both "lots" and "a lot" can function as adverbs modifying adjectives such as "more" in a comparative construction like this one. Therefore, there's no syntactic error in this sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct and well-constructed. It follows a logical syntax structure where the subject ("the more people you give beer to") is followed by the verb ("gets") and its complement ("sick"). Additionally, there is a parallel relationship between the two clauses established through the correlation word "more". This creates a clear and coherent meaning for the reader.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure for a comparative correlational sentence. The subject ("the more") is followed by the verb ("does smoke"), then the object ("Bill"). This pattern is repeated in the second clause with "the more" as the subject, "Susan" as the subject of the implied verb "hates", and "him" as the object.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence provided is grammatically correct and well-structured. It follows the standard subject-verb-object order in both clauses, making it easy for a native speaker to understand without any confusion. Additionally, there is appropriate use of verb tenses, punctuation, articles, pronouns, and prepositions throughout the sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically correct. It follows standard English grammar rules for word order, punctuation, and structure.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a syntax error as it lacks a main verb for the second clause ("he likes"). A corrected version would be "Who does John visit because he likes Sally?" or "Who does John visit Sally because he likes?" depending on what is intended by the original question.	I will provide two options based on my interpretation of the intended meaning: - Who does John visit because he likes *Sally*? - Who does John visit *Sally* because he likes?
1	Syntax	The sentence is correctly constructed syntactically. It has a subject ("Marianne"), an auxiliary verb ("did") and a main verb ("leave"). The negative particle "not" follows the auxiliary verb as required by standard English syntax rules.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Semantics	The sentence "He could not have been working" is grammatically correct but its meaning depends on the context in which it is used. It can be used to express past impossible condition or surprise about a present state of affairs. For example, if someone finds out that John has finished his work very quickly, they might say "He could not have been working that fast". However, without any specific context, it's hard to determine whether the sentence is semantically appropriate or not.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The negation in this sentence is incorrect. In formal American English, it's more common to use "can't" as a contraction for "cannot," rather than separating "not" from "can." Additionally, when using "have been" in the present perfect tense, we typically use a positive form ("he has been working") to indicate that something started in the past and continues up until now. To express disbelief about an ongoing action, native speakers might say "He couldn't be working!" instead.	The sentence should be either "He can't have been working" or "He couldn't be working," depending on the intended meaning.
1	Other Category	The sentence "You will believe Bob" is grammatically correct but it seems like there might be some missing context for the sentence to make complete sense. It would depend on what precedes this statement for it to have a clear meaning. For example, if someone said "I don't think Bob is trustworthy," then the response "You will believe Bob" could indicate disagreement or skepticism about the previous speaker's doubts. However, without any additional context, the sentence can still stand alone as being grammatically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically correct as it follows the standard structure of a simple sentence, i.e., Subject-Verb-Object (SVO): "John" (subject) "has not kissed" (verb) "Mary" (object).	The sentence is already correct.
1	Semantics	The sentence is semantically correct because it conveys a clear meaning and follows the rules of grammar. It implies that the speaker has never before encountered a location as remarkable as Bangor.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	In this sentence, "it" is incorrectly placed after a preposition ("up"). The personal pronoun following a preposition should be in objective case; hence, we need to use "him" instead of "it". Also, there's no comma needed before the conjunction "and" if used within two coordinating verb phrases as in the original sentence.	Mickey looked up him.
0	Syntax	The subject-auxiliary inversion needed for an interrogative sentence is missing. In other words, it should be "Did there tend to be..." instead of just "There tended to be..." if the intended meaning is a question.	Did there tend to be a lot of discussion? Or, if the original intention was not to formulate a question but rather make a statement, then simply saying "There often was a lot of discussion" would work better.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct and well-formed. The subject "John" is followed by a verb tense ("tried") that indicates past action, and the object of the sentence, "a good boy," follows standard rules for adjective placement before the noun it modifies.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Other Category	The sentence "John is eager" is grammatically correct as it follows standard English syntax rules for forming a simple sentence with a subject ("John") and a predicate adjective ("is eager"). The form of the verb "to be" agrees with the singular subject "John," and the predicate adjective correctly describes the subject's state. Therefore, there are no errors related to syntax, semantics, or morphology.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "We want John to win" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "we", and the verb is "want". The infinitive phrase "to win" functions as the direct object of the sentence, and it refers to what we want. The word "John" is the object of the preposition "to", indicating who will do the action of winning.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is structurally sound and grammatically correct. The subject ("the box") is followed by a verb ("contained"), and then there is an object ("the ball"). Additionally, there is a prepositional phrase ("from the tree") that modifies the direct object. All elements fit together well syntactically.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	In English, we do not say "the tube was escaped" because it violates subject-verb agreement rules. Instead, we would say "the tube was escaping" if referring to a process in progress, or "the tube had escaped" if referring to a past event completed before another action began. Alternatively, "gas escaped from the tube" follows standard active voice syntax for describing such events.	Gas escaped from the tube.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Water bubbled up out of the kettle" is grammatically correct because it follows standard English syntax rules for word order and structure.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "The tub leaked water" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "the tub," and the verb is "leaked." The direct object of the verb is "water." This structure follows standard English syntax rules for simple sentences.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a misplaced word. In the original sentence, "it" refers to "the bottle," but "it" comes before "the bottle" making the sentence unclear. A clearer way to express this idea would be: "What the water did to the bottle was fill it up."	What the water did to the bottle was fill it up.
0	Syntax	The subject ("what the water did to the whole bottle") and the verb ("was") do not agree in number. In this case, the subject is singular ("what the water did"), so the verb must be singular as well; however, "were" is a plural form. Changing "was" to "were" would result in another error because "water," being uncountable, cannot take on a plural form. Therefore, both the subject and the verb must remain singular.	The sentence is almost correct. However, since "water" is uncountable and singular, the corrected version will use "was": "What the water did to the whole bottle was fill it up."
0	Syntax	In this sentence, there is a mistake in subject-verb agreement. The singular subject "the tank" requires a singular verb form, but "leaked" is the past tense of the plural verb "to leak". A correction would be "The tank leaked the fluid freely", where "freely" functions as an adverb modifying the verb "leaked". Alternatively, if we want to use "free" as an object complement following "fluid", then we could say "The tank leaked the fluid free of charge", for example.	The tank leaked the fluid freely.
1	Syntax	The sentence "John lay the ball in the box" is grammatically correct, but its meaning depends on the context because the verb "lay" has multiple meanings. It can either mean "to put something down gently" or "to be prostrate". In this case, it seems more likely that John placed the ball in the box rather than lying down himself in the box. Therefore, a better word choice would be "placed", making the sentence unambiguous. However, since the grammar itself is correct, I will still give it a score of 1 for being syntactically correct even though there's room for improvement semantically.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "John owns the book" is grammatically correct. It follows a standard Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) word order in English. The subject "John" is a proper noun referring to a person, the verb "owns" indicates possession, and the object "the book" refers to a specific thing being possessed by the subject.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	This sentence uses two infinitive phrases ("to leave" and "to stay") as the objects of the verbs "persuaded." Each infinitive phrase has its own subject ("Mary" and "Sue"). This type of construction is called a coordinate verb structure, and it is grammatically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The clause "even though the courts didn't actually find" is a dependent clause, but it is being used as if it were an independent clause. A comma splice occurs when two independent clauses are incorrectly joined by only a comma. Here, there should be a semicolon instead of a comma before "even though," or the dependent clause can be changed into a subordinating conjunction such as "although" to connect the two thoughts correctly. Additionally, "consider" typically requires a direct object, so the wording could be improved for clarity.	Most people probably considered Klaus guilty of murder, even though the courts didn't actually find him so; or Most people probably considered that Klaus was guilty of murder, even though the courts didn't actually find it to be true.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Mary beautifully plays the violin" is grammatically correct. The subject "Mary" is the person performing the action, "beautifully" modifies the verb "plays," indicating the manner in which the action is performed, and "the violin" is the object being acted upon by the subject.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Semantics	The sentence contains a contradiction because it states that John will likely learn French effortlessly, but then implies he will do so instantly, without any time for practice or experience. This creates an inconsistency in meaning.	Although John will probably find learning French easy, he still needs some time to become proficient.
0	Syntax	In English, we do not use two objects (direct object and indirect object) with both "to" preposition when giving something to someone. The correct way would be "Sue gave Bill a book" or "Sue gave a book to Bill".	Sue gave Bill a book or Sue gave a book to Bill.
1	Syntax	The subject ("the men") and verb ("will leave") agree in number, making the sentence grammatically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "John went home" is grammatically correct. It consists of a noun phrase ("John") serving as the subject, followed by a verb phrase ("went home"). Both the subject and the verb agree in number (i.e., both are singular), so there is no issue with morphological agreement. Additionally, the meaning conveyed by the sentence is clear, indicating proper semantic interpretation. Therefore, I would classify any errors found in this sentence under syntax if present. However, for this particular example, the syntax appears well-formed.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The adverb "seriously" does not modify the verb "represented" correctly in this context. A better word choice would be "respectfully," indicating how they showed their attitude towards the dean Mary as a linguist. Additionally, there should be an article before "genuine linguist."	They represented respectfully to Dean Mary as a genuine linguist.
0	Syntax	In the sentence "Us love they," there is a problem with subject-verb agreement. The subject "us" requires a plural verb form, but "love" is singular. Additionally, the word order is incorrect for standard English; it should be "They love us."	They love us.
1	Syntax	The sentence "It is nice to go abroad" is grammatically correct. There are no errors in syntax, morphology, or semantics.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Mary intended John to go abroad" is grammatically correct. It has a clear subject ("Mary"), verb ("intended"), and object ("John"). The infinitive phrase "to go abroad" correctly functions as the direct object of the verb "intended," indicating what Mary had the intention for John to do.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Semantics	The sentence "I remembered having kissed Mary" is grammatically correct but its meaning is ambiguous without additional context. It can be interpreted as either a statement about remembering a past action ("I remember that I had kissed Mary") or as a statement about causing oneself to remember something by performing an action ("By kissing Mary, I reminded myself of her"). This type of semantic ambiguity is common in natural language and often requires context for resolution. However, since no specific context has been provided here, it is difficult to determine whether the intended interpretation is correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The coordinating conjunction "either" typically connects elements of equal weight within a sentence. However, it does not require a preceding negative construction as shown here. A correct usage would be: "I can't believe Fred will go, either." Or simply removing the "either": "I can't believe Fred won't."	I can't believe Fred won't. OR I can't believe Fred will go, either.
0	Syntax	The second instance of "want" needs a subject pronoun such as "I" instead of using another personal pronoun such as "me". This error makes the sentence grammatically incorrect according to English syntax rules.	John wants to read Fred's story, and I also want to (read it).
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a syntax error because the subject-verb agreement is incorrect. In this case, the plural subject "we" requires a plural verb. Therefore, instead of "to," it should be "who to invite."	We wanted to invite someone, but we couldn't decide who to invite.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct, and each clause follows standard subject-verb-object word order. Additionally, the parallel structure used when describing who will read whose story is appropriate.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The clause "Holly shouldn't" lacks a subject, making it unclear who or what Holly shouldn't do. In addition, there is no conjunction linking the two clauses together, so it sounds as if "eating cabbage" and "shouldn't" apply to different people. A possible correction would be "Mary claimed that while she herself eats cabbage, Holly shouldn't."	Mary claimed that while she herself eats cabbage, Holly shouldn't.
0	Syntax	The second coordinated clause "I also came to be" is missing a subject. In order for it to be grammatically correct, it needs to say either "I also came to be introduced" or simply "I did too," depending on what meaning you want to convey.	Mary came to be introduced by the bartender and I also came to be introduced. OR Mary came to be introduced by the bartender and I did too.
0	Syntax	The subject-auxiliary inversion is required after "if" when making a polite offer or request. Therefore, the correct form would be "If I can, I will work on it." instead of "I if can, will work on it."	If I can, I will work on it.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a correctly formed coordinating conjunction ("and") linking two independent clauses. However, there is no clear antecedent for the pronoun "his" in the second clause, making it unclear who Sally belongs to or what she possesses. A possible revision could be "Joe's neuroses bother his patrons, and Sally's do too," clarifying that Sally has her own set of neuroses that affect people similarly to how Joe's neuroses affect people. Alternatively, if we want to maintain the parallelism between "Joe's neuroses" and "Sally", we can revise as follows: "Joe's neuroses bother his patrons, and so do Sally's".	Joe's neuroses bother his patrons, and Sally's do too. OR Joe's neuroses bother his patrons, and so do Sally's.
0	Semantics	The issue with this sentence lies within its semantic interpretation. Although the sentence may appear grammatically correct, the meaning can be ambiguous due to the pronoun "it" referring back to two different entities - "book" and "class". This makes it unclear as to what exactly Lilly did for José.	I know which book José didn't read for class, and which book Lilly read for him instead.
0	Syntax	The second clause "and this is the one which Fred won't do it" contains a misplaced pronoun "it". It is unclear what "it" refers to in this context. A possible correction would be "and this is the one which Fred won't review".	This is the book which Bob reviewed, and this is the one which Fred won't review.
0	Semantics	The sentence is ambiguous because it's unclear who "you" refers to, making it difficult for the reader to understand the intended meaning. It could mean that there are two different books being referred to - one that Mag read, and another that Bob said someone else hadn't read. Alternatively, it could mean that there is only one book in question, but Bob made a statement about it regarding someone else's non-reading. Without clarification, the exact meaning cannot be determined.	To remove the ambiguity, we can rephrase the sentence as follows: Option 1: "I know which book Mag read, and I also know the book that Bob claimed you haven’t read." Option 2: "I am aware of the book that Mag read, and I know the title of the book that Bob mistakenly thought you had not read."
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a misplaced modifier, causing confusion about what "my report" refers to. A more clear syntax would be: "I know which book Mag read, and which book Bob read, but you hadn't read my report."	I know which book Mag read, and which book Bob read, but you hadn't read my report.
1	Semantics	The sentence is semantically correct as it conveys a clear meaning and does not contain any grammatical errors. It expresses a preference for someone eating fruit over cookies.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a redundancy error. In the first part of the sentence, "Rusty talked about himself" implies that no one else had previously discussed Rusty. Therefore, saying "only after Mary did talk about him" is unnecessary because it repeats information and creates confusion.	The corrected sentence would be: "Rusty talked about himself after Mary did."
0	Syntax	The redundancy of the word "talk" in the sentence creates a syntax error as it disrupts the parallelism between the two clauses. A corrected version would be "Fred talked about everything before Rusty did." OR "Fred discussed all topics before Rusty spoke about something."	Fred talked about everything before Rusty did.
1	Syntax	The sentence "John often meets Mary" is grammatically correct. It follows standard subject-verb-object word order, and all words are used appropriately in their proper forms.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	In this case, there is a subject-verb agreement error. The subject "problem" is singular, but the verb "perceives" is plural. The corrected form would be "The problem perceives easily," but this does not make sense semantically because problems do not have perception as humans do. A more appropriate way to express it might be, "It is easy to perceive the problem."	It is easy to perceive the problem.
1	Syntax	The sentence "A hundred men surrounded the fort" is grammatically correct. The subject "a hundred men" is plural and the verb "surrounded" agrees with it in number as a past tense form of the verb "to surround". Additionally, there are no missing words or misspellings.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	In English, we generally do not use the first person pronoun ("me") as the object of a verb when the subject refers to the same group of people. Instead, we would say "We elected him" or "They elected her," for example. The grammatically correct form of the sentence would be "They elected us" if referring to the speaker and others. Therefore, using "me" instead of "us" results in incorrect syntax.	They elected us.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a misplaced relative pronoun. In the original sentence, it seems as though we're looking for a specific submission related to John being incompetent. However, due to the incorrect placement of the word 'that', the sentence implies there is a submission about someone named 'That John'. A corrected version would be: "Which report did he submit that said John was incompetent?" or "Which report saying John was incompetent did he submit?"	Which report did he submit that said John was incompetent?
1	Syntax	The sentence is correctly written in terms of syntax as it follows the rules for forming a grammatical sentence in English. It consists of a subject ("Mary"), a verb ("has preferred"), and two objects ("lemons" and "limes"). Additionally, the word order is correct and there are no missing or extra words.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The clause "which were whining" is a relative clause modifying "cats," but it is lacking a proper antecedent. In order for this sentence to be grammatically correct, there needs to be a clear noun for "which" to refer back to. For example, the sentence could be revised as follows: "He let the cats that were whining out." This way, it's clear what is being modified by the relative clause.	He let the cats that were whining out.
0	Other Category	The sentence is missing necessary context to be evaluated for grammaticality. Without knowing what information has been previously provided about Bill's actions, it is impossible to determine if the question "What did Bill buy?" contains any errors.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is correctly constructed according to the rules of English syntax. It contains a subject ("Mary"), an auxiliary verb ("saw"), a direct object ("the boy"), and a present participle phrase ("walking toward the railroad station") functioning as an adverbial modifier of time.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a subject-verb agreement error. The verb "given" does not agree with its plural subject "a proof". It should be "have been given" instead. Additionally, there is a missing article before "John", it should be "the".	A proof that the claim had been made was given by the fact that John had lied. OR A proof that the claim had been made was the fact that John had lied.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains multiple issues related to syntax and word order. Specifically, there are two instances of misplaced phrases, making it difficult for the reader to understand the intended meaning. In addition, the use of possessive forms ("my factory") further complicates the interpretation of the sentence.	The fire that destroyed most of my factory can be attributed to a short circuit, which was caused by an overloaded transducer.
0	Syntax	This sentence contains a misplaced modifier error. The phrase "as being absurd" is modifying "the mayor," but it's clear from context that what's actually absurd is the proposal. Therefore, "being absurd" should modify "proposal" instead. Here's how we can fix it:	The mayor regarded the proposal to build a sidewalk from Dartmouth to Smith as absurd.
1	Syntax	The sentence "I want that Bill left to remain a secret" contains a syntactic error known as a dangling modifier. The word "that" introduces a clause modifying the subject of the sentence, but the subject ("I") does not fit logically with the action described by the verb ("left"). This results in confusion about who or what is performing the action. A possible correction would be "I want Bill to leave so that it remains a secret," where the subject fits logically with the verb.	I want Bill to leave so that it remains a secret.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains multiple syntactic errors. Specifically, there are two instances of the verb "drives" used incorrectly. In the first instance, it appears that "Tom" is intended to be the subject, but no auxiliary verb has been included for the present progressive tense. Additionally, the second instance of "drives" lacks a clear referent - if it is meant to describe what someone else does, then a new clause should be started. A corrected version could read: "I know a man whom Tom drives around as he/she drives." However, even the revised sentence may still contain some ambiguity.	The original sentence requires significant revision to become grammatically correct; here's a possibility: "I know a man whom Tom often chauffeurs on errands while driving himself."
0	Syntax	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in this sentence. The plural noun "cats" does not agree with the singular verb form "is". It should be "are", so the correct form would be "Drowning cats, which ARE against the law, are hard to rescue." However, even with this correction, there is still a potential issue with semantic ambiguity, as it's unclear whether "which are against the law" refers to drowning cats being illegal or rescuing them being illegal. A clearer way to express this idea might be: "Rescuing drowning cats, which is required by law, can be difficult."	Rescuing drowning cats, which is required by law, can be difficult.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Muriel said nothing else than that she had been insulted" is grammatically correct. It contains a correlative conjunction "not only...but also," where "nothing else" serves as the first part and "but also that she had been insulted" serves as the second part. Both parts are balanced and parallel in structure, making the sentence syntactically sound.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The reflexive pronoun "himself" cannot be the subject of a sentence; it must refer back to another noun or pronoun within the same clause. In this case, "Rutherford" seems intended as the subject who does the understanding, so we need a regular personal pronoun ("he") for the object of the verb. Here's how it should read:	"He understands himself by Rutherford." OR "Rutherford understands him himself." (Depending on what exactly is meant.)
1	Semantics	The sentence appears grammatically correct but there seems to be some missing context. It's unclear who or what "Arch" refers to, making it difficult for a reader to fully understand the intended meaning.	The sentence would be semantically improved if "Arch" is replaced by a pronoun or proper noun that has been previously introduced in the conversation or text. For example, "I feel that John will show up."
0	Syntax	In this sentence, there is a lack of a main verb, making it syntactically incorrect. A corrected version could be "The proof of whether this set is recursive is difficult."	The proof of whether this set is recursive is difficult.
0	Syntax	In this sentence, there are two independent clauses connected by only a conjunction ("and"). This creates a run-on sentence because each clause can stand alone as its own complete thought. To fix this issue, we need to add punctuation before the conjunction so that it separates the two clauses properly. Here's how we could revise it: * The madrigals that Henry plays on the lute and sings sound terrible. or * The madrigals that Henry plays the lute for and sings along to sound awful. In both cases, I added commas to separate the two clauses, since they are nonessential relative clauses modifying "madrigals" and thus set off from the rest of the sentence by commas. However, if these clauses were essential to understanding what "the madrigals" refers to, then no commas would be needed. For example: * The madrigals he plays the lute and sings are his favorites. Here, removing either clause changes the meaning significantly, so we don't use any commas around them. But without additional context, I assumed that the first pair of examples better fit the intended meaning based on common usage patterns.	The madrigals which Henry plays on the lute and sings sound terrible.
1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically correct because it follows the rules for word order and structure in English. Each clause has a subject ("Tom", "I", "Suzie") and a predicate ("picked...grapes", "washed...turnips", "will prepare..."), and they are connected by appropriate conjunctions ("and"). Additionally, each verb agrees with its corresponding subject in number.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence is a question but lacks appropriate punctuation. A question mark should be added at the end of the sentence to indicate it as a question.	Where did you go, and who ate what?
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a misplaced possessive pronoun 'his'. It is unclear whose guardians' employers are being referred to as president. Also, there is no verb indicating what action has been taken by 'we'. A possible correction could be: "Which boy's guardians did we elect as the president of their employer?"	Which boy's guardians did we elect as the president of their employer?
0	Semantics	The word "sane" requires a comparative or degree modifier because it's a subjective quality. So, the question could be rephrased as "How sane is Peter compared to someone else?" or "To what extent is Peter sane?". Without such modification, the sentence seems to lack context or comparison.	To what extent is Peter sane? OR How sane is Peter compared to his brother?
0	Syntax	The second clause of the sentence contains a minor syntax error. Instead of saying "the Hudson River too," it would be grammatically correct to say "the Hudson River as well" or simply "the Hudson River." This change would maintain the intended meaning while following standard syntactical rules for constructing coordinated phrases.	"I live at the place where Route 150 crosses the River and my dad lives at the place where Route 150 crosses the Hudson River as well."
0	Syntax	The pronoun 'it' does not have a clear antecedent in the sentence, leading to ambiguity about what 'it' refers to. It could refer to either 'the place' or 'Route 150', but neither interpretation makes sense in context. Additionally, using 'it' twice for two different things can be confusing.	The sentence should be revised as follows: "I live at the place where Route 150 crosses the Hudson River, and my dad lives there as well."
0	Syntax	The verb 'to make up' requires a direct object, as it is a transitive verb. In this case, there is no direct object following the verb, resulting in an incorrect sentence structure. A possible correction would be to add a direct object after 'up', such as 'Who is she trying to make up to now with her lies?'	Who is she trying to make up to now with her lies?
0	Syntax	The verb "get" should be used as the past participle "gotten" when it follows the auxiliary verb "was". However, there is no auxiliary verb in this sentence. Therefore, "get" should be used instead of "gotten". Additionally, the preposition "of" should be replaced by "from", because we get something from someone or somewhere, but not of them. Here's how the corrected sentence looks like:	The wind was got from a plot to negotiate an honorable end to the war in Vietnam. However, I would suggest changing the whole sentence since it still sounds awkward. For example: A plan to negotiate an honorable end to the war in Vietnam was revealed by a whistleblower.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a prepositional phrase "to my friends" that is misplaced. It should be placed after the verb it modifies ("talked"). Here's the corrected version: "Mike talked to my friends about politics yesterday."	Mike talked to my friends about politics yesterday.
1	Syntax	The sentence "It was expected by the reporters that the principal would fire some teacher" is grammatically correct. There are no issues with word order, subject-verb agreement, or tense consistency. Therefore, it falls under syntax - the arrangement of words to create meaningful sentences.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The error in this sentence lies in the use of pronouns. The speaker asks about "Mike," who is referred to using a masculine name but uses the feminine pronoun "she" later on. To maintain consistency and avoid confusion, it's essential to stick to either male or female pronouns throughout the statement. Here are two possible corrected versions: * Corrected Version #1: Which hat did Mike quip that he never wore? * Corrected Version #2: Which hat did Michelle quip that she never wore?	I chose to provide two corrected options since there seems to be some uncertainty regarding the gender associated with the name "Mike". So here they are again for clarity: * The sentence can be corrected as follows if we assume Mike is male: "Which hat did Mike quip that he never wore?" * Alternatively, if Mike is short for Michele or another female variation, then the corrected version would read: "Which hat did Michelle quip that she never wore?"
0	Syntax	The problem with this sentence lies in its syntax, specifically word order. In the original sentence, "which girl" appears at the beginning as a relative clause modifying an implied subject ("the girl") that doesn't exist yet. A better way to construct this question would be to place "which girl" after "Mike," so it becomes clear who he didn't see wearing the hat. Also, using "who" instead of "that" can improve readability since we're dealing with people here. Here is the corrected version:	Mike quipped that he had never seen which girl wear this hat.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct. All words are used appropriately and there are no spelling errors. Additionally, the sentence follows standard syntactical rules for word order and structure.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The word "some" cannot be negated by using "will not" before it. Instead, we can say "I won't have any money". Here, "any" is used as a negative polarity item, which is required for negation.	I won't have any money.
0	Semantics	The sentence contains a semantic error because there is no context provided to determine whether the belief about someone looking for something is true or false. Therefore, it cannot be definitively stated as either true or false.	I have reason to believe that someone was looking for something.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a misplaced modifier error. In the original sentence, it seems as though "he" is trying to force "me" to give "her" some money. However, based on the intended meaning, the speaker is saying that "he" tried to force them to give "her" some money. To fix this issue, we need to revise the sentence so that the subject ("he") and the direct object ("me") are next to each other. A possible revision could be: "He tried to force me to give her any money."	He tried to force me to give her any money.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct, but it contains a pronoun ("he") without an explicit antecedent earlier in the discourse. This can make the sentence ambiguous as to whom "he" refers. However, since there is only one possible referent in this context, I will assume that the intended meaning is clear enough for the purposes of evaluating grammaticality.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The pronoun "himself" is a reflexive pronoun, which typically refers back to the subject of the sentence. In this case, the subject is "I", so using "himself" as the object of the preposition "about" results in incorrect syntax.	The sentence should be corrected as follows: "I talked to Winston about him."
0	Syntax	The first clause "That the fuzz wanted him worried John" contains a word order error. In this case, the subject ("the fuzz") and the verb ("wanted") need to be followed by the object ("him"). Additionally, there seems to be confusion between the participle form of the verb "to worry" (i.e., worrying) and its adjective form (i.e., worried), as well as unclear use of relative pronouns. A possible correction could be: "That the fuzz had worried John upset him, but it didn't worry Mary when they wanted her."	That the fuzz had worried John upset him, but it didn't worry Mary when they wanted her.
0	Syntax	The subject-auxiliary inversion needed for questions does not occur in this sentence. It should be "Will Sam work on it if you work on it?" instead of "will be working".	Will Sam work on it if you work on it?
0	Identify the category of error (Syntax, Semantics, Morphology, or Other Category), if applicable. *	Provide a detailed explanation of the mistake(s) found in the sentence or the reason why the sentence is correct. *	Return the corrected version of the original sentence, if necessary, or state "The sentence is already correct." if no corrections are needed. I hope this helps! Let me know how I can assist you further.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a redundancy error. The word "with" is unnecessary because the preposition has already been expressed by "for". A more concise way to express this idea would be: "Here's a knife for you to cut up the onions."	The sentence is not correct. Corrected version: "Here's a knife for you to cut up the onions."
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a subject-verb agreement error. In this case, the verb "is" does not agree with its plural subject "everybody". It should be changed to "are", so it agrees with the plural noun. Additionally, there's a comma splice issue where two independent clauses are separated by just a comma without any coordinating conjunction joining them together. This makes for a run-on sentence.	Fluffy is sick, which not everyone knows. Or, Fluffy is sick; not everyone knows this.
0	Semantics	The sentence "Maxwell is quite a doctor" is grammatically correct but semantically odd because the word "quite" suggests that there might be some reservations about how much of a doctor Maxwell is. A more natural way to express admiration for someone's skills as a physician would be to say "Maxwell is an excellent doctor" or "Maxwell is a very skilled doctor".	The sentence "Maxwell is quite a doctor" could be made clearer by saying "Maxwell is an excellent doctor" or "Maxwell is a very skilled doctor", depending on the intended meaning.
0	Syntax	This sentence contains an extra "and" before "the older one," making it a run-on sentence. It can be corrected by removing the second "and".	The younger woman might have been tall and the older one definitely was, blond.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a repetition of the subject pronoun "She" which can be corrected by replacing it with a pronoun such as "she's". Additionally, there is a missing comma after "blond," making the sentence hard to read.	Corrected version: "Sally is tall, and may be blond, and Sheila is short, and definitely is blonde."
0	Syntax	The verb "try" should be followed by a base form of the verb, so it should be "I have to finish grading some papers" instead of "I have to trying to finish grading some papers".	I have to finish grading some papers.
0	Syntax	This sentence contains a redundancy error. The word "for" appears twice, causing a repetition that disrupts the flow of the sentence and makes it unclear what is being referred to as "planned". Additionally, there is no clear subject or verb in the second half of the sentence. A possible correction could be: "The socks are ready for you to put on and are part of your plan."	The socks are ready for you to put on and are part of your plan.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct and well-structured. The subject "it" has a predicate "is easy to play sonatas on this violin," where the verb "is" agrees with its singular subject, and there are no any misplaced modifiers, ambiguous expressions, etc.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct but can be improved for clarity by switching the order of the prepositional phrases “on this violin” and “difficult to play.” It’s more common to mention the instrument after describing its level of difficulty.	The sentence is almost correct; however, it would be clearer if rewritten as follows: “This violin is difficult to play sonatas on.”
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a syntactic error because there is no verb after "my father" and before the punctuation mark. Additionally, it seems as though the speaker intended for "and" to indicate another subject ("I") but forgot to include it, resulting in a run-on sentence.	The corrected sentence could be either of the following two options, depending on the intended meaning: a) "My mother is easy to please, and so is my father." b) "My mother, who is easy to please, and my father..."
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct but there is a missing punctuation mark between "Poor Bill," and "it had started". This creates a run-on effect making two separate statements into one. Adding a period or semicolon would improve readability and clarity.	Either "Poor Bill. It had started to rain and he had no umbrella." or "Poor Bill; it had started to rain and he had no umbrella."
0	Syntax	The second sentence "that robbery" is a fragment because it does not have a subject and verb. It appears to be referring back to something in the first sentence but it needs to be connected properly using words such as "it", "this," or "the". Also, there should be a punctuation mark between the two sentences.	That the cops spoke to the janitor about it yesterday is terrible, that's why we need to do something about this robbery.
0	Syntax	The subject of the second clause, "he," should be connected to the first clause using a conjunction such as "and" instead of having a comma separating them. This error results in a run-on sentence, making it difficult for readers to follow the intended meaning. Additionally, there is no need for a comma after "Every student" since it's clear who is being referred to without further clarification. A correct version would be: "Every student and he wears socks is a swinger," but even then, the sentence remains unclear due to its unusual structure. It seems best to rephrase the entire statement.	Either every student wears socks, or they are all swingers; however, the current formulation does not make sense.
1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically well-formed as it follows the subject-verb-object structure correctly. It contains a noun phrase ("that girl"), a verb ("was given"), and another noun phrase ("my binoculars") followed by a prepositional phrase ("by him"). All elements are grammatically sound and fit together logically.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Bill didn't allege that Roger had eaten anything" is grammatically correct. It follows standard English syntax rules for word order and structure.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows standard subject-verb-object word order and has no missing components. Additionally, it contains a correctly constructed relative clause ("who hates to eat anything") that modifies the noun "Nobody".	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The subject of the second clause ("whoever buys anything on credit") contains a relative pronoun ("whoever"), which requires a singular verb for subject-verb agreement. Therefore, "talks" should be changed to "talk".	Everybody around here who ever buys anything on credit talks in their sleep.
0	Semantics	The issue with this sentence lies in its semantic meaning. Specifically, it is unclear whether the speaker cannot recall the identity of a particular person who expressed doubts ("I can't remember the name of John, who had misgivings"), or if they cannot recollect anyone who ever expressed any doubts whatsoever ("I can't remember anybody who has ever had misgivings"). To clarify the intended meaning, additional context would be required.	It depends on the intended meaning; here are two possible options: - If the speaker wants to convey that they cannot remember the identity of a specific individual who expressed doubts, then the corrected sentence could be: "I can't remember the name of the person who had misgivings." - Alternatively, if the speaker intends to express that they cannot recall anyone who ever had doubts, then the corrected sentence could be: "I can't remember anyone who has ever had misgivings."
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a subject-verb agreement error. The verb "meets" does not agree with its plural subject "no writers and no playwrights". It should be changed to "meet".	The corrected sentence would be: "No writer and no playwright meet in Vienna."
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a subject-verb agreement error. The verb "meets" does not agree with its plural subject "no writers, nor any playwrights". It should be changed to "meet" to match the plural subject.	The corrected sentence would be: "No writers, nor any playwrights, meet in Vienna."
0	Semantics	The sentence is grammatically correct but its intended meaning is unclear due to ambiguity. It can be interpreted as either "It's uncertain whether you will marry a particular student" or "There isn't a specific student that you have decided to marry for sure". In order to clarify the intended meaning, additional context or rephrasing would be necessary.	A more clear way to express the first interpretation could be: "It'…/p> Label: 0 Category: Semantics Explanation: The statement contains a logical fallacy known as hasty generalization. Just because some students may struggle with learning English does not necessarily mean all students face similar difficulties. This oversimplification leads to misrepresentation of facts. The sentence is not correct. Here's a revised version without the logical fallacy: Some students might find it challenging to learn English, but it doesn't imply every single student faces the same difficulty.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Felicia kicked the ball off the bench" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules for word order and structure in English. In this sentence, the subject ("Felicia") comes before the verb ("kicked"), and the object ("the ball") comes between the verb and the preposition ("off"). This is a simple active voice sentence with proper syntax.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically correct because it follows the rules for word order and structure in English. The subject ("I") comes before the verb ("sent"), and the object ("the package") appears between the verb and its preposition phrase modifier ("halfway around the world").	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Sam gave the ball out of the basket" is grammatically correct, but its meaning is ambiguous due to the preposition "out of". It could mean that Sam gave the ball while it was still inside the basket, or that he took the ball out of the basket before giving it away. Therefore, depending on the intended meaning, a more precise preposition such as "from" or "out" may be necessary for clarity. However, since there is no way to determine the author's intended meaning without additional context, I will assume that the sentence is syntactically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Sam offered the ball out of the basket" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Sam", who is performing the action of offering something, indicated by the verb "offered". The direct object of the sentence is "the ball", which is what is being offered. Finally, the prepositional phrase "out of the basket" indicates where the ball was taken from. Therefore, there are no syntax errors in this sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct and well-formed. The subject ("Park Square") is followed by a linking verb ("has"), which is then modified by an adjectival phrase ("a festive air"). This structure follows standard English syntax rules for forming simple declarative sentences.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	This sentence follows standard English syntax rules for subject-verb agreement, as the singular subject "worker" matches with the singular verb "will have." Additionally, word order is appropriate, with the subject preceding the verb.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The pronoun "that" cannot refer back to a person, only things. Therefore, it would be more appropriate to use "it" instead of "that" in this context. Additionally, there is no need for a comma after "forgive". A better version of this sentence would read as follows: "No one can forgive such a comment to you."	The sentence I provided earlier ("No one can forgive that comment to you.") corrected to say: "No one can forgive such a comment to you."
1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically correct as it follows the rules of word order and structure in English. It contains a complete thought and expresses a clear meaning.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically correct because all of its components are arranged properly and follow grammatical rules. It has a clear subject ("Sarah"), verb ("promised"), and object ("her old car") in the first clause, followed by another subject ("he"), verb ("gave"), and indirect object ("it to her son") in the second clause. All of these elements work together smoothly to convey a coherent meaning without any glaring errors.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The word "partway" can only modify a verb, so it cannot be used before "to". A correct way to phrase the sentence would be "I lent the book partway through to Tony", meaning that you lent the book to Tony during some portion of its length or duration. Alternatively, if you meant to say that you lent the book to Tony only partially, then you could instead use "only partly" or "not fully": "I only partly lent the book to Tony" or "I didn't fully lend the book to Tony".	I lent the book partway through to Tony.
1	Syntax	This sentence follows the rules of syntax for English grammar. It has a subject ("the farmer"), a verb ("loaded"), and an object ("the cart"). Additionally, there is a prepositional phrase ("with apples") modifying the verb. All parts of speech agree in number, person, and tense.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	In the sentence "The farmer dumped the cart with apples," the prepositional phrase "with apples" is modifying the verb "dumped" incorrectly. It would be more appropriate to say "The farmer dumped the apples from the cart" or "The farmer emptied the cart of apples." This way, it's clear that the apples are what's being dumped or emptied.	The sentence should be "The farmer dumped the apples from the cart" or "The farmer emptied the cart of apples."
0	Semantics	The verb "carve" typically takes an object that refers to something hard, such as stone or wood. It doesn't make sense for someone to carve a soft or pliable material like a baby. A more appropriate sentence might be "Martha carved a toy out of wood for the baby."	Martha carved a toy out of wood for the baby.
1	Syntax	The sentence "The bread cuts easily" is grammatically correct. In this sentence, "the bread" serves as the subject, while "cuts" acts as the verb, agreeing in number with its subject. Finally, "easily" functions as an adverb modifying the verb "cuts". No morphological, syntactical, or semantic errors can be identified in this sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The verb "broke" cannot be used transitively in this way; a more appropriate word would be "hurt". Additionally, it's unclear from the sentence whether Bill's finger was broken or if Bill himself was hurt. A clearer sentence might be "Janet broke Bill's finger" or "Janet hurt Bill on the finger."	Janet broke Bill's finger.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Janet broke the cup" is grammatically correct. It follows standard Subject-Verb-Object word order in English.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "The visitor rang the bell" is grammatically correct because it follows standard English syntax rules for word order and structure. Specifically, the subject ("the visitor") comes before the verb ("rang"), and the direct object ("the bell") follows the verb. This adheres to the Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) pattern common in English. Additionally, each word is morphologically correct, and there is no semantic ambiguity in the sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence is missing a direct object after the verb "pulled," making it unclear what is being pulled free. A complete thought requires both a subject ("we") and a predicate ("pulled" plus a direct object), so without additional context indicating what is being pulled free, I must assume there's something grammatically incorrect about this sentence.	The sentence would be improved by adding a clear direct object, for example, "We pulled free the rope" or "We pulled free from the trap".
1	Syntax	The sentence "That movie always shocks people" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "that movie," and the verb is "shocks." The word "always" functions as a time adverb, modifying the verb "shocks." This construction follows standard English syntax rules for simple sentences.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The subject-predicate agreement rule has been violated in this sentence. The singular third person present tense form of the verb 'to be' should have been used instead of the plural form. Here, 'that movie' is a single entity; therefore, we need to use 'shocks' instead of 'shocks'.	The sentence should read as follows - "That movie always shocks." OR "Those movies always shock." depending on whether there is more than one movie being referred to in the context.
0	Syntax	In the English language, we must use a preposition such as "to" or "into" when describing movement into a location. The word "the" after "came" implies that "Sharon" has become the room, rather than moved into it. A correct version would be "Sharon came **into** the room," where "into" denotes motion towards and arrival in the room's interior.	Sharon came into the room.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Bill sent a package to Tom" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure of an English sentence. In this case, "Bill" is the subject, "sent" is the verb, and "a package to Tom" is the object. The use of prepositions and articles is also appropriate.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "That acorn will grow into an oak tree" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules for English syntax. It has a subject ("that acorn"), a helping verb ("will") that agrees with the subject, and a predicate ("grow into an oak tree"). The words are arranged in a way that makes sense and conveys a clear meaning.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "He turned into a frog" is grammatically correct. The subject "he" agrees with the verb "turned," both in number and person. Additionally, the preposition "into" correctly introduces the noun phrase "a frog," indicating the change undergone by the subject.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically correct because it follows the rules for word order and structure in English. The subject ("I") comes first, followed by the verb ("mixed"), and then the object ("the sugar"). The prepositional phrase ("into the butter") provides additional information about where the action took place.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence "Brian threw the fence with the stick" is syntactically incorrect because it implies that Brian used the fence as a tool to throw something with the help of the stick. A more likely scenario is that Brian threw something at the fence using a stick as a projectile. Therefore, a grammatically correct version would be "Brian threw the stick at the fence."	Brian threw the stick at the fence.
1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically well-formed as it follows the subject-verb-object structure correctly. The subject ("Mira") performs the action denoted by the verb ("condemned"), and there is a clear object ("Terry") who receives the action. Moreover, the prepositional phrase "for the accident" provides additional information about the reason for Terry's condemnation. All elements cohere together, making the sentence grammatically sound.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "We investigated the area for bombs" is grammatically correct. The subject "we" agrees with the verb "investigated," and the prepositional phrase "for bombs" correctly modifies the verb by telling us what the investigation was focused on.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically correct because it follows the rules for word order and structure in English. Specifically, the subject ("I") comes before the verb ("sensed"), and the object ("his eagerness") comes after the verb. Additionally, the possessive pronoun ("his") correctly modifies the noun ("eagerness").	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "They praised the dedication in the volunteers" is grammatically correct, but it could be improved for clarity by specifying what aspect of the volunteers they were praising. For example, "They praised the volunteers' dedication" would make it clearer that the volunteers themselves possess the quality of dedication being praised. However, since the original sentence is still grammatically correct, I will mark it as such.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Semantics	This sentence is grammatically correct but I will provide a semantic evaluation for additional context. The statement "The earth was believed to be round" implies that there was a time when people had doubts about the shape of Earth; however, it has been known since ancient times that the Earth is spherical. Therefore, a more accurate way to express this idea would be "The Earth was thought to be round," as this conveys the understanding that although early civilizations may have imagined Earth differently, we now know its true shape.	The Earth was thought to be round.
1	Other Category	The sentence "Sarah smiled a charming smile" is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple clause with the subject "Sarah," the verb "smiled," and the object complement "a charming smile." The use of the article "a" before both adjective + noun combinations ("a smiling" and "a charmingsmile") is appropriate as it indicates that these descriptions are unique for each instance.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Sandra beamed a cheerful welcome" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Sandra," who is performing the action of "beaming." The direct object of the verb is "a cheerful welcome," which is what she is beaming. This structure follows the rules of syntax for an English sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Other Category	The sentence “You’ve really lived it up” is grammatically correct but its meaning might be unclear without additional context. This sentence could be interpreted as a comment on someone having enjoyed themselves or taken advantage of opportunities. However, without more information, it is difficult to determine the exact intended meaning. Therefore, while the syntax and morphology are correct, the semantics are somewhat vague.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The verb "lift" requires a direct object to complete its meaning, but there is no noun or pronoun after it to serve as the direct object. In order for the sentence to be grammatically correct, we need to specify what is being lifted onto the table. For example: "Paperback books lift easily onto the table," or "One can easily lift paperback books onto the table."	Paperback books lift easily onto the table.
0	Syntax	In the sentence "The books lifted onto the table", there is a problem with subject-verb agreement. The singular verb form "lifted" does not agree with its plural subject "books". It should be "The books lift onto the table," but this still sounds awkward because we typically use "lift" as a transitive verb, meaning it requires an object. Instead, consider revising the sentence so that the number of the subject and verb agrees, for example: "They lifted the books onto the table."	They lifted the books onto the table.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Jessica loaded boxes under the wagon" is grammatically correct, but the intended meaning may be unclear without additional context. Typically, when loading something, it is being placed into or onto something else. In this case, it is not clear whether Jessica is putting the boxes into the wagon or on top of the wagon. To improve clarity, a preposition such as "into" or "onto" could be added. However, since the question only asks for a binary judgment of grammaticality, I will still return 1 because there are no syntactic errors in the sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically correct as it follows the basic structure of a simple sentence, i.e., Subject-Verb-Object (SVO): "Jessica" (subject) "loaded" (verb) "boxes" (object) "on the wagon" (prepositional phrase acting as an adverbial phrase modifying the verb "loaded").	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The verb "cram" requires a direct object to complete its meaning. In this case, there is no specific box being referred to as receiving the action of cramming. A better way to construct this sentence would be "Jessica crammed things into the boxes at the truck" or "Jessica crammed the boxes full at the truck".	Jessica crammed the boxes full at the truck.
0	Syntax	The verb "butter" requires a direct object to complete its meaning. In this case, "toast" should be the direct object of the verb "buttered," so it needs to come immediately after the verb. The preposition "at" is unnecessary here.	Lora buttered the toast.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Carla shoveled the walk" is grammatically correct because it follows standard subject-verb-object word order in English, and all words are used correctly in their intended function within the sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Nora sent the book" is grammatically correct. It follows a standard Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) word order in English where "Nora" is the subject, "sent" is the verb, and "the book" is the object.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Nora sent Peter the book" is grammatically correct because it follows standard English syntax rules for word order in a simple sentence. In English, the typical word order is subject-verb-object (SVO), as demonstrated in this sentence: "Nora" (subject) "sent" (verb) "Peter the book" (object).	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Carla slid the book" is grammatically correct because it follows standard English syntax rules for word order in a simple sentence. In this case, the subject ("Carla") comes before the verb ("slid"), and the object ("the book") follows the verb. This adheres to the Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) structure found in English.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	In this sentence, "slid" requires a direct object to complete its meaning. The word "at" indicates a prepositional phrase, but there needs to be a noun or pronoun after "the book" for the sentence to make sense. For example, it could be "Carla slid the book across the floor," or "Carla slid at the sight of the book falling off the shelf." Without this additional information, the sentence does not follow standard English syntax rules.	Carla slid the book across the floor.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Amanda carried the package to Pamela" is grammatically correct because it follows the basic structure of a simple sentence, which includes a subject ("Amanda"), an action verb ("carried"), and an object ("the package"). Additionally, the prepositional phrase "to Pamela" modifies the verb by telling us where the action occurred.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The subject and verb do not agree in number. In the sentence "Packages drive easily to New York," packages is a plural noun and drive is a singular verb. This results in a syntactically incorrect sentence because the subject-verb agreement rule has been violated.	A package drives easily to New York. OR Packages drive easily to New York City.
0	Syntax	In the sentence "The chair pushed," it is unclear what is causing the action of pushing since there is no actor specified. A more grammatically complete version would include a subject that can perform actions, such as "Someone pushed the chair" or "The wind pushed the chair."	Someone pushed the chair.
1	Syntax	The sentence "We offered a job to her" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "we," and the verb is "offered." The direct object is "a job," and the indirect object is "to her." All elements are correctly placed and inflected for number and tense, following syntactic rules.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	In English, a sentence requires both a subject and a verb. This is known as subject-verb agreement. The sentence "A job offered" lacks a main verb, so it is syntactically incomplete and incorrect.	The sentence "A job was offered" would be grammatically complete because it contains a subject ("a job") and a finite verb form ("was offered").
1	Syntax	The sentence "Brown presented a plaque to Jones" is grammatically correct because it follows standard English syntax rules for word order and structure. Specifically, the subject ("Brown") comes before the verb ("presented"), and the direct object ("a plaque") follows the verb. Additionally, the indirect object ("to Jones") correctly indicates who received the action of presenting.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Carmen bought Mary a dress" is grammatically correct. It follows the standard subject-verb-object word order in English.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Carmen obtained the spare part at the hardware store" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence, "Carmen," is followed by a verb, "obtained," and the object of the verb, "the spare part," is clearly indicated. The prepositional phrase "at the hardware store" further clarifies where the action took place.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically correct because it follows the standard structure of a simple sentence, having a subject ("Michelle") and a predicate ("kept the desk with the papers"). Additionally, the verb tense is consistent throughout the sentence, and all elements agree with each other in number.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Frances hid the presents in the drawer" is grammatically correct because it follows standard subject-verb-object word order and has a clear meaning.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure in English. In this case, "the needle" is the subject, "poked" is the verb, and "the cloth" is the object. Additionally, each word is correctly conjugated for tense and number.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Carrie touched that cat" is grammatically correct. It follows standard Subject-Verb-Object word order in English.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Herman whipped the sugar and the cream" is grammatically correct. It follows standard English syntax rules for subject-verb-object word order, and uses appropriate conjunctions to connect two objects ("the sugar and the cream").	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically correct because it follows the rules for word order and structure in English. In a simple sentence such as this, we have a subject ("Linda"), a verb ("taped"), and an object ("the picture"). Additionally, the prepositional phrase "to the wall" correctly modifies the verb by telling us where the action occurred.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically correct because it follows the rules for word order and structure in English. The subject ("Linda") comes before the verb ("taped"), and the object ("the picture") comes between the verb and its preposition ("onto"). The prepositional phrase then correctly modifies the verb by telling us where the action took place.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct because it follows standard subject-verb-object word order ("the child and her mother" as the subject, "clung" as the verb, and nothing as the object), uses appropriate determiners ("the"), and correctly employs a plural subject with a plural verb.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Other Category	The sentence "This flyer and that flyer differ" is grammatically correct but it contains a redundancy since 'differ' means 'not be the same as'. A better way to express this idea would be "These flyers are different".	These flyers are different.
0	Syntax	The preposition "apart" needs to be followed by the preposition "from" when it's used to indicate a difference between two things. So, the correct usage would be "This flyer and that flyer differ from each other."	The sentence should be: "This flyer and that flyer differ from each other."
0	Syntax	In the sentence "The jeweler scribbled the contract with his name," there is a syntactic error related to the preposition "with". Typically, we use "with" when two things have or share a particular quality or feature. However, in this case, it seems that the intended meaning is that the jeweler signed the contract using his own name as a signature. A more appropriate preposition for such contexts would be "in" or "under", so a grammatically correct version could be: "The jeweler scribbled the contract under his name" or "The jeweler scribbled the contract in his name."	The sentence corrected with the suggested options can read either "The jeweler scribbled the contract under his name" or "The jeweler scribbled the contract in his name."
0	Semantics	An acorn does not grow into a tree; rather, it germinates and develops into a seedling, which then grows into a mature tree. Therefore, the semantic relationship between "acorn" and "oak tree" is incorrect in this context.	The gardener nurtured the acorn until it became an oak tree.
1	Syntax	The sentence "I shaped a loaf" is grammatically correct. It follows standard English syntax rules for subject-verb-object word order.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	In present tense, a verb must agree with its subject in number. Here, the subject "children" is plural but the verb "amuses" is singular. Therefore, the correct form of the verb for the plural subject would be "amuse".	The children amuse.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Susan whispered the news" is grammatically correct because it follows standard subject-verb-object word order in English and each word is used appropriately within its context.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Susan whispered at Rachel" is grammatically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically correct as it follows the standard structure of a simple sentence with a subject ("Ellen") and a predicate ("said that melons were selling well"). Additionally, the verb tense is consistent throughout the sentence, making the syntax clear and easy to understand.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence is missing a noun after "about" because we need to specify what "present conditions" refers to. It would be grammatically correct if it says something like "Ellen said about the present conditions of her garden".	Ellen said about the present conditions of the weather.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Ellen warned Helen against skating on thin ice" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure for an English sentence, which includes a subject ("Ellen"), a verb ("warned"), and an object ("Helen") as well as additional information about where she was being warned against ("skating on thin ice"). The word order is appropriate and there are no grammatical errors such as incorrect tense usage, agreement issues between subjects and verbs, or misplaced modifiers. Therefore, the syntax of this sentence is correct.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Cynthia nibbled on the carrot" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Cynthia," a proper noun, and it agrees with the verb "nibbled," which is in past tense. Additionally, the preposition "on" indicates the relationship between the verb and its object, "the carrot."	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Cynthia chews" would be incorrect because it implies that Cynthia's action of chewing is habitual or continuous, while the use of the simple past tense ("chewed") indicates a completed action in the past. Since no context has been provided suggesting otherwise, I will assume that Cynthia's act of chewing occurred only once in the past.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Paul laughed at Mary" is grammatically correct. It follows the standard subject-verb-object word order in English. The subject ("Paul") is doing the action denoted by the verb ("laughed"), and the object ("Mary") is receiving the action.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The error in this sentence is syntactic because it relates to the structure of the sentence. In this case, the verb "wink" requires an object that can be blinked, such as an eye. The noun phrase "her lip" is not a grammatically acceptable object for this verb.	Linda winked her eye.
0	Syntax	The verb "pound" requires a direct object, but in this case, there is no noun or pronoun following it to serve as its direct object. A more appropriate way to express this idea would be "My heart is pounding *in my chest*" or "*against my ribcage*".	The sentence should be "My heart is pounding," or "My heart is pounding in my chest" if additional detail is desired.
1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically well-formed as it follows the standard structure of Subject-Verb-Object (SVO), where 'Sharon' acts as the subject, 'fainted' serves as the verb, and 'from hunger' functions as a prepositional phrase modifying the verb.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	This sentence follows the correct syntax rules for a simple sentence in English. It contains a subject ("the witch") and a predicate ("poisoned the children"). Additionally, it uses appropriate verb tense and word order.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "A grandfather clock ticked in the hallway" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules for subject-verb agreement, word order, and punctuation in English. In this sentence, "a grandfather clock" serves as the subject, while "ticked" functions as the verb. The adverb "in the hallway" modifies the verb by providing additional information about where the action took place.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The verb "squeak" typically does not take a direct object; it describes the sound that something makes when it is rubbed together or subjected to pressure. Therefore, saying "I squeezed the door" would be more appropriate if you mean that you caused the door to make a squeaking noise by applying force to it. However, without additional context suggesting otherwise, "the door" cannot logically function as the direct object of the verb "squeak".	The sentence should be: "I squeezed the door," or simply, "The door squeaked."
1	Syntax	The sentence is correctly constructed according to the rules of syntax in English. Each word has been placed in its proper order and functions appropriately within the context of the sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Soaring temperatures are predicted for this weekend" is grammatically correct. It follows the standard subject-verb-object word order in English, where "soaring temperatures" serves as the subject, "are" functions as the linking verb, and "predicted" serves as the predicate adjective. Moreover, the tense of the verbs is consistent throughout the sentence, adding to its grammaticality.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The subject ("the fort") and verb ("fluttered") do not agree in number - "fort" is singular while "fluttered" requires a plural subject. A more appropriate word for "fort" would be something that can move or change shape, since only things that have those properties can "flutter".	The flags on the fort fluttered in the wind.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct. It consists of a noun phrase ("the voices") acting as the subject, followed by a verb phrase ("echoed") acting as the predicate. Additionally, it contains a prepositional phrase ("in the hall") providing additional information about where the action took place.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "The stream twists through the valley" is grammatically correct because it follows standard subject-verb-object word order, and all words are used appropriately according to their part of speech. Additionally, there are no missing or extra words, making the syntax clear and coherent.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in this sentence. In this case, "there" is used as a dummy subject, so the verb must agree with the real subject that follows it ("opportunity"). Therefore, the correct form of the verb would be "presented," without the "-s". A more natural way to construct this sentence would be to use "An" instead of "There", making the corrected sentence "An wonderful opportunity presented itself yesterday.", but even then, it'd sound better if we rephrase the whole thing into something like "A wonderful opportunity came up yesterday."	A wonderful opportunity came up yesterday.
1	Syntax	The sentence is correctly structured according to English syntax rules. It consists of a noun phrase ("a wonderful opportunity"), a time expression ("yesterday") and a subject-verb-object pattern ("presented itself to him"). All elements are grammatically correct and in their proper place within the sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The verb "jumped" should agree in number with its subject "a little white rabbit," which is singular. Therefore, we need to use the third person singular form of the past tense of the verb, which is "jumped" (not "jumps"). Hence, the correct sentence is "Out of the box jumped a little white rabbit."	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Penny skated around the rink" is grammatically correct. It follows standard subject-verb-object word order, and all words are used appropriately.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Jackie accompanied Rose" is grammatically correct. It follows standard English syntax rules for word order in a simple sentence (subject + verb + object). In this case, "Jackie" is the subject, "accompanied" is the verb, and "Rose" is the object.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The subject-verb agreement rule states that when the subject consists of two or more nouns connected by and, the verb must be plural. In this case, the subject "many information" is incorrect because "information" is uncountable and cannot be made plural. A correct form would be "much information," but since it's uncountable, a better way to express this idea is to say "A lot of information was provided."	A lot of information was provided.
0	Morphology	The noun 'advice' is uncountable, so it should be used with a singular verb. Therefore, 'many advices' is incorrect because 'advices' is not a valid form of the word.	John offers much advice.
1	Syntax	This sentence is syntactically correct because it follows the rules for word order, sentence structure, and punctuation in English grammar. It contains a subject ("the cake that Jones got"), a comparative adjective ("more delicious") modified by an adverb ("than"), and another noun phrase ("the one that Smith got"). All these elements form a grammatically correct complex sentence expressing a comparison between two entities.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in the recommendation part of the sentence. The plural nouns 'cake' and 'pastry' require a verb in its plural form as well. Therefore, it should be 'eat less cakes and pastries', or better yet, use uncountable forms such as 'less cake and passery'.	It is recommended to eat less cake and pastry OR It is recommended to eat less cake and fewer pastries.
1	Syntax	The sentence is correctly constructed according to English syntax rules. It consists of a noun phrase ("that gas") and a verb phrase ("can explode"), connected by the subject-verb agreement rule.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "He washed her" is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple sentence structure: subject ("he") + verb ("washed") + object ("her").	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The verb "wash" requires an object to complete its meaning. In this case, it should be "Wash **you**!" but since we don't usually command ourselves to do something, a more natural way would be "Wash yourself!" or simply "Wash up!" when telling someone else.	Wash up!
0	Syntax	The sentence "They have no in" is grammatically incorrect because it lacks a complete object after "no". It seems as though there might be missing words in the sentence. A possible correction could be "They have no idea where he is", assuming this fits the intended meaning.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The pronoun "some" needs to be replaced by a determiner such as "some of" because it requires a noun to follow it. Additionally, there shouldn't be any space between the determiners "some" and "of".	Some of my jobs are in jeopardy.
0	Syntax	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in this sentence. In English, a singular subject requires a singular verb form. Here, the plural noun "policemen" should be used instead of the singular "policeman" because it agrees with the plural verb "met". Additionally, we usually use the article 'the' before unique identifiers such as 'last night'. Therefore, the corrected version would read: "It was **the police officer** who met several young students in the park **the other night.**"	It was the police officer who met several young students in the park the other night.
0	Syntax	The subject-auxiliary inversion needed for a yes/no question has been applied incorrectly. In this case, it should be "Did the policeman meet **in** the park?" instead of "did the policeman meet **on** the park?" because we use 'in' before most nouns referring to enclosed spaces (such as parks), while 'on' is used when talking about surfaces (not applicable here).	Did the policeman meet in the park? (No change.)
1	Syntax	The sentence "John put old books in the box" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object word order in English. Additionally, all words are used appropriately and there are no spelling errors.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	In this sentence, there is a missing preposition after "proud". A possible correction could be "The monkeys are proud of their leader.", where "of" is the required preposition.	The monkeys are proud of their leader.
0	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically incorrect because there is a missing adjective after "very". It would be appropriate to say something such as "John sounded very tired" or "John sounded very happy", but without any additional information about how John sounded, the sentence is ungrammatical.	The sentence could be corrected by adding an appropriate adjective, for example: "John sounded very tired."
0	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically incomplete and lacks a main verb, making it difficult for the reader to understand the intended meaning. A complete sentence requires both a subject and a predicate, but "I don't know" only contains a subject without any accompanying action or state of being. Adding a suitable verb would make the sentence syntactically correct.	The sentence could be corrected as follows: "I don't know if I should agree."
1	Syntax	The sentence "John bought a book on the table" is grammatically correct. It follows standard subject-verb-object word order in English ("John bought"), and uses appropriate prepositions ("on") to indicate location.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "John called the president a fool" is grammatically correct. It follows standard English syntax rules for subject-verb-object word order.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is mostly correct syntactically, but there seems to be a missing punctuation mark at the end. A period or question mark would complete the sentence properly.	I forgot how good beer tastes. OR I forgot how good beer tastes?
1	Other Category	The sentence "This teacher is a genius" is grammatically correct. It consists of a subject ("this teacher") and a predicate ("is a genius"). The subject agrees with the verb in number, and the word order is correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The verb tense is incorrect in this sentence. In English, when we talk about something that continues to be true in the present, we use the present perfect tense, which is formed using has/have + past participle. In this case, the correct form of the verb "remain" would be "has remained". Additionally, the word order needs to be changed slightly for the sentence to make sense. Here's a corrected version of the sentence: *A good friend **has** remained loyal to me by him.*	The sentence I provided in the explanation section is the correct one.
1	Syntax	The sentence "John ate his noodle quietly" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence, "John," is doing the action of eating, as indicated by the verb "ate." Additionally, we can see that "noodle" is possessive ("his noodle"), indicating that it belongs to John. Finally, the adverb "quietly" correctly modifies how John is eating his noodle.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "A smith hammered the metal" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object word order in English. Moreover, the verb tense agrees with the time frame of the action being described, and the words themselves do not have any spelling errors.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Sandy removed her ballet shoes" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object word order in English. Additionally, the verb tense agrees with the time frame of the action being described.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Semantics	The sentence "This week will be a difficult one for us" is grammatically correct but its meaning can be ambiguous without additional context. However, based on the information provided, I will assume it is correct.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is correctly structured with proper subject-verb agreement and word order.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Everyone hoped that she would sing" follows standard English syntax rules for word order and structure. It has a clear subject ("everyone"), verb ("hoped"), and object ("she would sing"). The use of subordinating conjunction "that" connects two clauses smoothly. All words are inflected correctly according to their grammatical roles in the sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct, as it follows standard English syntax rules for word order and structure. The subject ("this") is followed by the verb ("proved"), and the object ("a decisive factor") comes last.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Semantics	In this sentence, there is nothing wrong grammatically in terms of syntax, morphology, etc., but semantically it does not make sense because crocodiles do not eat doughnuts; they eat meat. So, the sentence cannot be true in reality.	The sentence is already correct, but it's semantically absurd as crocodiles don't eat doughnuts. A better example would be 'The crocodile devoured the deer.'
1	Syntax	The sentence "John is afraid of Bill" is grammatically correct. It follows the standard structure for an English sentence, consisting of a subject ("John"), a linking verb ("is"), and an object ("afraid of Bill").	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence "John put under the bathtub" is incorrect because it lacks a preposition indicating where John placed something. A correct version could be "John put something under the bathtub."	John put something under the bathtub.
1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically correct because it follows the rules for word order and structure in English. In this sentence, the subject ("John") comes before the verb ("placed"), and the object ("Kim") comes after the verb. Additionally, there is a prepositional phrase ("behind the garage") that modifies the verb and provides additional information about where John placed Kim.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence "Kim depends for Sandy" is grammatically incorrect because it lacks a verb indicating how Kim relates to Sandy. A corrected version could be "Kim depends on Sandy" or "Kim waits for Sandy," depending on the intended meaning.	Kim depends on Sandy.
1	Syntax	The sentence "John put the book in the box" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a simple sentence in English - Subject-Verb-Object (SVO): "John" (subject) performs the action denoted by the verb "put", acting on the object "the book". Furthermore, the prepositional phrase "in the box" provides additional information about where the action occurred. Therefore, there are no syntax errors in this sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically correct as it follows the rules for word order and structure in English.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "John regards Bill as a good friend" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure for an English sentence: subject ("John") + verb ("regards") + object ("Bill") + prepositional phrase ("as a good friend"). The syntax is clear and unambiguous.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Kim put in the box" is grammatically correct but it lacks a clear object for the verb "put". A more complete version could be "Kim put the book in the box", where "the book" serves as the direct object providing additional clarity about what action took place. However, since no specific context has been provided, I will assume the original sentence is acceptable.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence follows all rules of syntax for standard English. It has a subject ("the chickens"), verb ("seem"), and complement ("fond of the farmer"). The word order is correct, and there are no missing words or extra words.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows standard subject-verb-object word order, and all words are used appropriately for their intended meaning.	The rules require that the executives be polite.
0	Syntax	In this sentence, the word "nominated" should be in the past tense ("nominated") instead of the present participle form ("nominating"). Additionally, there needs to be a conjunction such as "and" between "That Fred was unpopular" and "nominated Bill". The corrected sentence would read "That Fred was unpopular and nominated Bill."	That Fred was unpopular and nominated Bill.
1	Syntax	The sentence "They were taking a hard look at possible FTA" is grammatically correct. The subject "they" agrees with the verb "were taking," and the object "a hard look" is modified by the adjective "hard" for clarity. Additionally, the prepositional phrase "at possible FTA" specifies what they were looking at, providing necessary context.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The preposition "against" in this context does not make logical sense because it implies payment for something rather than receiving something in exchange. A more appropriate preposition might be "for," as in "John paid me for the book." Alternatively, if John handed over money while taking possession of the book, a possible correction could be "John paid me on the book" (meaning he placed the money directly onto the book). However, without additional context, I can't say for certain whether this alternative phrasing would fit the intended meaning.	John paid me for the book.
1	Syntax	The sentence is correctly structured according to the rules of syntax in English. It contains a subject ("the committee"), a verb ("will study"), and an object ("the feasibility of setting up a national computer network"). All words are used appropriately and there are no misplaced modifiers or other issues that would affect meaning or clarity.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains an incorrect use of the pronoun "them" as a direct object of the causative verb "made". In English, it's more common to use a bare infinitive after "make", so the correct form would be "We made them be rude." However, some people might argue that using a gerund instead of an infinitive can imply a longer-term state rather than a single action. So, both forms could be considered acceptable, but the original sentence without the repeated "be" sounds unnatural.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "After reading the pamphlet, Judy threw it into the garbage can." is grammatically correct. There are no errors in syntax, morphology, or semantics.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The verb "studying" should agree with its subject "Students," so it needs a plural form "read."	Students studying English read Conrad's Heart of Darkness while at university.
0	Syntax	The sentence "I read some of the book" is syntactically incorrect because it lacks a determiner before the word "book". In English, we must specify which book we're referring to by using a determiner such as "the", "a", or "this". Without a determiner, the sentence becomes ambiguous and difficult for the reader to understand.	The sentence should be corrected as follows: "I read some of the book(s)." Alternatively, if there is no need to emphasize which specific books, then simply adding a determiner would suffice: "I read some of the book."
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct as it follows standard subject-verb agreement rules. The plural noun "fruit" takes the singular verb form "is," indicating a general condition rather than individual fruits being referred to.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence "Neither of students failed" is grammatically incorrect because it lacks a determiner before "students". It should be "neither of the students", "neither of his students", etc.	The corrected sentence would be "Neither of the students failed."
0	Syntax	The error in this sentence lies in the lack of a determiner before the word 'water'. A more appropriate way to phrase it would be "I drank some of the water" or simply "I drank some water". In this case, 'the' acts as a definite article, specifying a particular set of water. Without any determiners, the sentence becomes ungrammatical.	I drank some of the water.
0	Morphology	The word "hair" should be plural since it refers to more than one strand of gold. The adjective "golden" describes the noun "hair," so it should come before the noun.	The sentence should read as follows: "It is a golden hairs." However, I would recommend changing the singular form "a" to the plural form "some" for better grammar. Therefore, the corrected sentence should be: "It is some golden hairs." But if we want to keep the meaning of the original sentence, then the best correction would be: "These are golden hairs."
1	Syntax	This sentence follows standard English syntax rules for subject-verb-object word order and has no grammatical errors.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The reflexive pronoun "itself" must refer back to a singular, antecedent noun. In this case, however, the plural noun "dogs" serves as the antecedent for the singular reflexive pronoun "itself," creating a mismatch between the number agreement of the two words. This error results in ungrammaticality and makes the sentence incorrect.	The sentence should read: "That dog is so ferocious, it even tried to bite himself." Alternatively, if there are multiple dogs being referred to, then the reflexive pronoun should be changed accordingly: "Those dogs are so ferocious, they even tried to bite each other."
0	Syntax	The verb "wash" requires a object pronoun ("you") instead of a reflexive pronoun ("yourself"). Therefore, the correct form would be "He washed you." However, since there's no context indicating who the speaker is referring to as the object of the washing action, it might be more appropriate to say "He washed someone" or specify the person being washed.	He washed you. OR The sentence is already correct if changed to "He washed someone" or similar.
0	Syntax	The sentence "John is easy to please Kim" is syntactically incorrect because it lacks a preposition such as "for" after "please". A correct version would be "John is easy to please *for* Kim", where "*for*" indicates who the action is performed for. Without the preposition, the sentence can be interpreted in various ways, including "Kim finds John easy to please", but none of these interpretations match the intended meaning.	John is easy to please for Kim.
0	Syntax	The sentence is missing a main verb. It seems as though there is a subject ("intelligent") but no predicate. A complete sentence requires both.	The sentence could be corrected by adding a suitable verb such as 'people' to make it read: "There seemed to be intelligent people."
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct and well-formed. The subject "John" is clearly identified, and the verb "tried" agrees with it in number. The infinitive phrase "to please Stephen" functions as the direct object of the sentence, providing a clear action and goal.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Semantics	The sentence "We believed John to be a fountain in the park" contains a semantic error because it asserts that someone named John is a physical object, specifically a fountain located in a park. This statement is illogical and does not make sense within the context of normal human experience.	The sentence is not already correct; here's a corrected version: "We believed John to be acting strangely in the park."
0	Syntax	The subject ("it") does not clearly refer to a specific antecedent, leading to confusion about what or who is trying to leave the country. Additionally, there could be a missing article before "country," making it either "the country" if referring to a specific country or "a country" if talking generically about countries. A clearer sentence would specify what or who is leaving and make sure the definite or indefinite article is used appropriately.	The dog tries to leave the country. OR The dog tries to leave a country.
1	Syntax	The sentence "John tries to leave the country" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "John", a noun in the common case singular form. The verb "tries" is in the third person present tense, indicating that the subject is performing the action. The infinitive phrase "to leave the country" functions as the complement of the sentence, describing what John is trying to do.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically correct as it follows the rules for word order, agreement, and structure in English. It contains a subject ("Under the bed"), a linking verb ("seems"), and a predicate nominative ("a fun place to hide"). All elements are grammatically appropriate and contribute to a coherent meaning.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in this sentence. The verb "is" does not agree with its plural subject "sheep". It should be changed to "there are" to correctly match the plural noun.	There are believed to be sheep in the park.
0	Syntax	The word "would" after "hope" is unnecessary and incorrect because we use the base form of the verb after "hope," so it should be "I hope to study in France."	I hope to study in France.
1	Syntax	The sentence "John can kick the ball" follows the standard structure for a simple sentence in English, consisting of a subject ("John") and a predicate ("can kick the ball"). Additionally, it uses appropriate tense ("can"), proper verb agreement between the subject and its corresponding verb form, and contains no grammatical errors.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	In English, subject pronouns such as "he," "she," and "John" require a verb in the third person singular form when referring to present tense actions. The correct third person singular form of the verb "rain" is "rains." Therefore, the sentence should read "John will be raining tomorrow" if we want to express the idea that it will be raining on the day following today and John will be part of that event. Alternatively, the original sentence could have been written as "John will rain on us tomorrow" if John has control over the weather, but I doubt that's what was intended here.	John will be raining tomorrow.
0	Syntax	The subject ("there") and auxiliary verb ("expect") must agree in number. Therefore, "will" should be changed to "were" to match the plural noun "there". Additionally, it's more natural to use a contraction such as "it's" instead of "there is" or "there are", so the corrected sentence would read "It's expected to rain."	It's expected to rain.
1	Syntax	The sentence "John was found in the office" is grammatically correct. It follows standard English syntax rules for word order and structure.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The auxiliary verb "did" must be followed by a past tense verb. In this case, the base form "be" is used instead of the past tense "was" or "were". Also, questions in English require subject-auxiliary inversion, so the word order should be "Did the child be...?" should be "Was the child there?" or "Did the child go to school?".	Was the child in the school? Or did the child go to school?
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no errors in syntax, morphology, or semantics. All words are used correctly, and they follow proper grammatical rules for forming a simple declarative sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a double negative ("not" and "never"), which can lead to confusion as it creates a positive statement instead of a negative one. In modern English, we typically avoid using multiple negatives in the same clause. A more appropriate way to express this idea would be to say "John wants to stay in the town," or if you want to keep the original meaning, you could say "John doesn't want to leave the town."	John doesn't want to leave the town.
1	Syntax	The sentence is correctly written according to the rules of syntax in English. Each clause contains a subject ("Mary" and "Bill") and a verb ("likes" and "hates"). Additionally, each clause has a clear relationship between them through the coordinating conjunction "but".	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a double negative ("needn't" + "not"), which creates confusion about the intended meaning. It would be better to use a positive form such as "They don't have to take this exam" or a negative form without a double negation such as "They can skip this exam".	They don't have to take this exam.
1	Syntax	The sentence is correctly constructed according to the rules of English syntax. It contains a subject ("Ann"), a modal verb ("may"), a base form of the verb ("spend"), a preposition ("in"), and an object ("Italy"). All elements are arranged in a logical order, making the sentence easy to understand.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is correctly written in terms of syntax as it follows the rules for forming a grammatically correct sentence in English. It consists of two independent clauses ("They love to play golf" and "I do not") connected by a conjunction ("but"), which shows the relationship between them. Each clause has a subject ("they", "I") and a verb ("love", "do not"). This structure allows clear communication of meaning without any errors in sentence construction.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "George has spent a lot of money, hasn't he?" is grammatically correct. It contains a tag question ("hasn't he?"), which is used to confirm information or seek agreement from the listener. In this case, the tag question is negative, so it requires a positive statement before it. This requirement is fulfilled by the main clause "George has spent a lot of money". Therefore, there is no syntactic error in this sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains an error in its verb tense agreement. The past perfect tense ("scarcely could he do") is used incorrectly here because there is no indication of a second completed action in the past. A simple past tense would be more appropriate for the subject "he" in this context.	As a statesman, he scarcely could have done anything worth mentioning.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows standard subject-verb-object word order and uses appropriate tense and pluralization.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically well-formed as it follows the rules for word order and structure in English. It contains a subject ("One of Korea's most famous poets"), a verb ("wrote"), and a direct object ("these lines"). Additionally, the possessive form "Korea's" correctly modifies the noun "poets".	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence appears to be grammatically correct, with a clear subject ("somebody"), verb ("struck"), and object ("the unidentified victim"). It also includes appropriate determiners and modifiers, such as "apparently" and "during the early morning hours," which provide additional context for the action described.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "The car was driven" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "the car," a noun in singular form. The verb "was driven" is in past tense and agrees with the subject. Therefore, there are no syntax errors in this sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Ricky can be relied on" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Ricky," and the verb is "can be relied on," which agrees with the subject in number. Additionally, there are no missing words or punctuation errors.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "The bed was slept in" is grammatically correct. It uses the past participle form of the verb "sleep," which functions as an adjective describing the state of the bed after someone has slept in it. This type of construction is called a passive voice, where the focus is on the action rather than who performed the action.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The subject ("a pound") and the object ("the book") are both singular nouns, but the verb must agree in number with the subject, so "was" should be changed to "were": "A pound**s** were weighed by the book." This error is a syntax error because it has to do with how words are combined into phrases and sentences according to grammatical rules.	The sentence should read "A pounds were weighed by the book," although I suspect what you meant to say was "The book weighed a pound," since scales weigh objects rather than vice versa!
0	Syntax	The sentence is missing a required question mark at the end, making it syntactically incorrect. In addition, although commonly used informally, starting a sentence with "who do you" can be considered ungrammatical by some; instead, consider using "you think Tom saw".	Who do you think Tom saw? OR You think Tom saw whom?
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct and well-formed. It follows standard subject-verb-object word order and has a clear meaning. The use of the past perfect tense ("had spent") correctly indicates that the action of spending money occurred prior to some other past event or time. Additionally, there are no spelling, punctuation, or morphological errors in the sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a syntactic error because it lacks a proper subject-verb agreement. In particular, the verb "knows" requires a singular noun as its subject, but the intended subject seems to be the plural noun "politicians". Moreover, there is no clear relationship between the pronouns "her" and "Fed", so their usage needs further clarification.	Fed knows which politician she should vote for.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a question form but does not have a question mark at the end. It should be "How did you guess that he fixed the computer?" instead.	How did you guess that he fixed the computer?
1	Syntax	The sentence is correctly written in terms of syntax as it follows the rules for word order and structure in English. It contains a subject ("the committee"), a verb ("knows"), and an object complement clause ("whose efforts to achieve peace the world should honor"). All punctuation marks are used appropriately.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The verb "does" must agree in number with the subject "which house". In this case, it should be "Which houses do..." if referring to more than one house, or simply "Which house does...?" when referring to a singular noun as intended here. However, there's still a missing auxiliary verb needed for forming questions correctly; thus, making it necessary to rephrase the question entirely into something like "In which house does your friend live?".	In which house does your friend live?
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct. It uses a relative clause ("from whom I bought these bagels") to modify the noun "baker". This construction follows standard rules for English syntax.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is structurally correct and all the words are used appropriately. Therefore, there are no syntax errors in the sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The preposition "with" is only needed once in this sentence. It's redundant to include it after "in love". A correct version would be "Jack is the person whom Jenny fell in love with." Or better yet, using the modern form: "Jack is the person Jenny fell in love with."	Jack is the person Jenny fell in love with.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct and follows the rules for English syntax. It has a clear subject ("a bench"), a verb ("to sit"), and an object ("on"). The word order is appropriate, making the meaning easy to understand.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is correctly structured according to English syntax rules. It has a subject ("I"), a verb ("met"), and an object ("the man who grows peaches"). The clause "who grows peaches" provides additional information about the noun it modifies, "the man". This type of subordinate clause is called a relative clause, and it is set off by a relative pronoun such as "who", "which", or "that". In this case, "who" refers to the direct object "the man," so no comma is needed before the relative pronoun.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a pronoun ("his") with no clear antecedent. It's unclear who the possessive form refers to. A possible correction would be to specify the person being referred to by adding their name before the word "approval" as follows: "Which topic did you choose without getting John's approval?"	Which topic did you choose without getting approval? Or, more clearly, "Without getting approval, which topic did you choose?"
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a pronoun "you" without an explicit antecedent. In other words, it's unclear who or what "you" refers to in this context. A more appropriate way to express this thought would be: "Which topic did you find boring because Mary talked about it?" or "I got bored when Mary talked about which topic?"	Which topic did you find boring because Mary talked about it?
1	Semantics	The sentence is semantically correct as it conveys a clear meaning without any grammatical errors. However, for completeness, I would add a noun or pronoun before "that" to clarify what action or decision led to his resignation. For example, "That's the reason why he resigned from his job."	That's the reason why he resigned from his job.
0	Other Category	The sentence "It bothers me that John coughs" is grammatically correct but may be unclear or confusing without additional context. Specifically, it's not clear whether the speaker is bothered by John coughing right now or if they are generally annoyed when John coughs.	To improve clarity, consider revising the sentence based on the intended meaning. For example, if the speaker is bothered by John coughing right now, a more precise version might be: "John's coughing bothers me." Alternatively, if the speaker is annoyed whenever John coughs, a better option could be: "I get irritated every time John coughs."
0	Syntax	The verb "to please" requires a direct object, but none is provided in this sentence. A corrected version would be "It is easy to please John," where "John" serves as the direct object. Alternatively, "John is easily pleased" could be used if we want to express that John can be satisfied without difficulty.	It is easy to please John.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Kim is eager to please Tom" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Kim," who is described as being "eager to please Tom." This is a simple sentence with proper syntax.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a subject ("that we invaded Iraq") and a predicate ("really bites"). However, there is no verb in the subject part of the sentence. A more appropriate way to express this idea would be "It really bites that we invaded Iraq".	It really bites that we invaded Iraq.
0	Syntax	The subject ("It") and verb ("annoys") do not agree in number. In this case, "it" is singular while "annoy" requires a plural subject.	The sentence should be corrected as follows: "Them annoying me is Fido's barking."
0	Syntax	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in this sentence. In English, singular subjects require a singular verb form. Here, the subject "who" is singular but it's followed by the plural verb form "were". To fix this issue, replace "was" with "who achieved the best result was Angela" or change "was" to "were" and make "Angela" plural ("Who achieved the best results were Angela and Bill").	Either "Who achieved the best result was Angela." or "Who achieved the best results were Angela and Bill." depending on whether there's only one person who achieved the best result or more than one.
1	Syntax	The sentence is correctly structured and there are no grammatical errors. The subject ("the peasant girl") is clearly identified, followed by a verb ("got") and an object ("it"). The word order follows standard English syntax rules.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The error in this sentence lies in subject-verb agreement. The subject of the sentence is "that kind of person," which requires a singular verb form. However, the verb used here is "are," which is plural. It should be replaced with its singular counterpart, "is." Additionally, there's redundancy with "anyone" - we don't need both "anyone" and an indefinite pronoun ("a person"). Here is the corrected version:	A person like that is hard to find to look after. Alternatively, if sticking with "anyone", it would read as follows: Finding someone who can look after a person like that is difficult.
0	Semantics	The sentence is grammatically correct but semantically incorrect because it implies a negative ability rather than negating an action. In other words, it suggests that the owl cannot hunt due to illness, whereas the intended meaning might be that the owl does not hunt mice when it is sick.	The corrected sentence would be: "A sick owl does not hunter mice" to convey the intended meaning more accurately. However, since it sounds unnatural, I suggest rephrasing it as follows: "When an owl is sick, it typically doesn't hunt for mice."
0	Syntax	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in this sentence. The verb "has" should agree with its plural subject "candidates," so it should read "have" instead of "has": "Each candidate who have interest in semantics will be admitted to the department."	Each candidate who has interest in semantics will be admitted to the department. (changed "has" to "have")
0	Syntax	The subject ("a book") is singular, but the verb ("are") is plural. This creates a mismatch between the subject and the verb, causing a syntax error.	A book that I recently read is very interesting.
0	Syntax	The subject-auxiliary inversion required for a positive tag question is missing. A correct version would be: "I'm sure we even have these tickets, don't we?"	I'm sure we even have these tickets, don't we?
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a double negative ("even" and "got"), which creates confusion and makes it unclear whether the speaker is certain about having the tickets or not. In formal English, using two negatives in one sentence usually results in a positive meaning, but here it seems that the intended meaning might be either positive or negative.	The sentence "I'm even sure we have these tickets!" would convey the same idea more clearly. Alternatively, if the intention is to express uncertainty, consider saying "I'm even unsure if we have these tickets!"
1	Semantics	The sentence is grammatically correct but semantically confusing. The word "urban" modifies "guerrillas," implying a type of guerrilla fighter who operates specifically within cities. However, it seems more likely that the speaker meant to say they don't sympathize with "urban guerillas" as a general concept rather than having personal feelings toward specific individuals. This discrepancy between intended meaning and actual usage can lead to confusion among readers.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Semantics	The sentence is logically consistent and grammatically correct. Therefore, there are no errors in syntax, morphology, or semantics.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a comma splice error, where two independent clauses ("he was hungry" and "John whined") are incorrectly connected by only a comma. This results in a run-on sentence, making it difficult for readers to understand the intended meaning. To fix this issue, we can use either a semicolon, coordinating conjunction, or period between these two clauses.	The corrected sentence could be: * He was hungry; therefore, John whined. * He was hungry, so John whined. * He was hungry. Consequently, John whined.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a preposition pile-up error. In English grammar, it's generally best to avoid having two prepositions ("after" and "of") directly following each other. A more natural way to express the intended meaning would be: "I gave Mary a book after the party."	I gave Mary a book after the party.
0	Syntax	The coordinating conjunction "as for" should connect two independent clauses. Here it seems to be used incorrectly to connect a noun phrase ("Mary") and a clause ("I really like her"). It would be grammatically correct to say "As for Mary, I really like her because she's so pleasant."	As for Mary, I really like her because she's so pleasant.
1	Syntax	The sentence is constructed correctly according to the rules of syntax in English. It contains a subject ("he"), a verb ("hate") and two objects ("those" and "Carter"). Additionally, there is a subordinate clause "it doesn't matter," which provides additional information but does not affect the grammaticality of the main clause.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The subject ("With no job") and verb ("would be") in this sentence do not agree in number. A more grammatically correct way to phrase the idea expressed by the original sentence might be as follows: "Without a job, John wouldn't be happy."	Without a job, John wouldn't be happy.
0	Syntax	The correct form of the verb "to have" after "much" and "many" is "have," not "of." This mistake is common among native speakers because we often hear "I've got a lot of work to do" instead of saying "I have a lot of work to do." However, if we use "much" as a determiner before uncountable nouns, then we must say "have." In summary, it should be "I have much of the manuscript left to type" changed into "I have much of the manuscript left to typeset."	I have much of the manuscript left to typeset.
1	Syntax	The sentence "He's a more reliable man" is grammatically correct. Here, "he's" is a contraction for "he is," and it serves as the subject of the sentence. The comparative adjective "more" modifies the adjective "reliable," indicating a comparison between two things. Finally, "man" functions as the direct object of the sentence. Therefore, there are no syntax errors in this sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The subject-auxiliary inversion required for a negative question is missing. It should be "Is any trouble what I don't want?" instead of "Any trouble is what I don't want."	Is any trouble what I don't want?
1	Syntax	The sentence "They may grow as high as bamboo" is grammatically correct but semantically it's unclear what the subject "they" refers to, so it would be better if we specify the subject clearly. For example, "Giraffes may grow as high as bamboo". But there is no syntactic error in this sentence.	Giraffes may grow as high as bamboo.
0	Syntax	The subject of the sentence is "some of them," which implies multiple people. However, the verb "made" is singular, while it should be plural ("make") to agree with the subject.	Some of them make as many errors as 20.
0	Syntax	The subject of the sentence, "Sally", is singular, but the reflexive pronoun used in the object position ("himself") is plural. In order for the sentence to be grammatically correct, a singular reflexive pronoun must be used. Therefore, the correct form would be "Sally kissed herself".	Sally kissed herself.
1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically correct because it follows the rules for word order and structure in English. Each clause has a subject ("Drew," "I," "Rosie") and a predicate ("believes...ads"), and they are all connected by appropriate conjunctions ("that").	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is correctly written in terms of syntax as it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure. It contains a list of names followed by a verb, indicating they all performed the same action.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Semantics	The sentence is grammatically correct and conveys a clear meaning about hoping for no snow during winter.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	In this sentence, there is a subject-verb agreement error. The subject of the sentence is "blue leather," which is plural, but the verb "shows" is singular. Additionally, the pronoun referring to Betsy should be "she" instead of "herself". A corrected version of the sentence would read: "Blue leather shows that Betsy is pretty." However, even with these corrections made, the sentence still has some awkwardness due to the unusual metaphorical use of "blue leather" as the subject.	Blue leather shows that Betsy is pretty.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Gwen hit the baseball" is grammatically correct because it follows standard Subject-Verb-Object word order in English.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The pronoun "that" is used incorrectly here; it should be replaced by a subject personal pronoun such as "you" or "he". Additionally, there is no verb linking the two clauses together. A possible correction could be: "I hit him, and I know that you knew the answer."	I hit him, and I know you knew the answer.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct. It uses a correlative conjunction ("or") to connect two independent clauses. Each clause has a subject ("I've lost") and a predicate ("my wallet" or "my mind"). This structure allows for the expression of a disjunctive statement, where either clause could be true but both cannot be false.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is correctly structured according to the rules of syntax in English. A determiner ("a") precedes the noun ("brand"), followed by an adjective ("new"). Another determiner ("that") introduces a relative clause modifying the noun phrase "a brand new car". The verb tense agrees with the subject, making the sentence grammatically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is correctly constructed according to the rules of English syntax. It consists of two independent clauses joined by the conjunction "and". Each clause contains a subject ("he") and a verb ("likes" and "hates"), and both subjects refer to the same person. This makes the meaning clear and easy to understand.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "They chased the man with the car" is grammatically correct. The syntax follows a standard subject-verb-object structure with "they" as the subject, "chased" as the verb, and "the man with the car" as the object.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct but it uses an outdated expression ("red cent") which may be unfamiliar to some people. It would be clearer to say "I didn't have a single penny" or "I didn't have any money".	The sentence is already correct, although a more commonly used expression could be used for clarity.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a syntactical error because there is no conjunction between the two phrases "the book of poems" and "from Blackwell," making it unclear how these two phrases are related. Additionally, the verb "takes" does not agree with its subject "the book of poems and from Blackwell" as it requires a plural subject.	The corrected sentence would be: "Reading the book of poems and selections from Blackwell takes a very long time." In this version, I added the conjunction "and" before "selections" for clarity and changed the verb form to "reading" to match the singular subject "the book of poems."
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct but it would be clearer if there was a comma after "one" to show that it is nonessential information. This type of clause is called a restrictive relative clause because it provides essential information about the noun it modifies. A nonrestrictive relative clause simply gives additional, nonessential information about the noun. It should be set off by commas.	The sentence is almost correct; however, for clarity, I recommend adding a comma: "The one, with a red cover, takes a very long time to read."
1	Syntax	The sentence "John has a fear of dogs" is grammatically correct. It follows the standard subject-verb-object structure of English sentences, where "John" is the subject, "has" is the verb, and "a fear of dogs" is the object. Additionally, the article "a" correctly precedes the countable noun "fear," indicating that it refers to a single instance of fear.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	In this sentence, we have a subject-verb agreement error. The subject "the building" is singular, so the verb should be singular as well. Therefore, instead of "is", it should be "has". Additionally, possessive forms ("'s") should only be used before nouns; therefore, "building's" should simply be "building". Here is the corrected version:	The building has a leaking roof.
0	Syntax	In this sentence, there is a repetition of the determiner 'the' before 'coat'. The correct form would be "The panther's coat is dark black" without the repeated article.	The panther's coat is dark black.
1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically correct as it follows the rules for word order and structure in English. It contains an independent clause ("Colin asked") and a dependent clause ("if they could get a mortgage"), separated by a subordinating conjunction ("if"). This creates a complex sentence that is grammatically sound.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Semantics	This sentence implies that the man who got into the taxi committed a robbery at the bank. However, it does not specify whether the man seen getting into the cab was the same person who later robbed the bank. It's possible that they are different people, so the meaning of the sentence is ambiguous. A clearer way to express this idea would be: "The man I saw getting into the cab robbed the bank" or "I saw the man who robbed the bank get into a cab".	The sentence could be corrected as follows: "The man I saw getting into the cab was the one who robbed the bank." or "I saw the man who robbed the bank get into a cab."
1	Syntax	The sentence is correctly structured from a syntactic perspective. It follows standard Subject-Verb-Object word order, and all elements have appropriate grammatical forms for their functions within the sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "John's drum will always bother me" is grammatically correct. It follows standard English syntax rules for word order and structure.	The sentence is already correct.
0	N/A	The sentence "An evil thought struck Dave" is grammatically correct and has a clear meaning. Therefore, there are no issues related to syntax, morphology, or semantics.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is correctly constructed according to the rules of syntax in English. It contains a subject ("John"), a verb ("put") and an object ("the book"). Additionally, it shows the relationship between these components through appropriate word order and use of prepositions.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Phillip gave the medal to the soldier" is grammatically correct. It follows standard English syntax rules for word order and structure in a simple sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The verb 'to eat' needs to agree with its subject in number, so it should be 'eats', not 'to eat'. Additionally, we need a helping verb such as 'does' before 'think' for subject-verb agreement since 'Heidi' is singular.	The corrected sentence would be: "Heidi does think that Andy eats salmon flavored candy bars."
1	Semantics	The sentence is grammatically correct but may have an odd meaning because it combines two concepts that don't normally go together - eating salmon-flavored candy bars. However, if this is the intended meaning, then there is no grammatical error.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "He danced" is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple sentence with a subject ("he") and a verb ("danced") in the past tense. The subject-verb agreement is also correct as "he" is singular and "danced" agrees with it in number. Therefore, there are no syntax errors in this sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The subject and verb do not agree in number. In this case, "Calvin" is singular but "his" indicates a plural noun. It would be grammatically correct to say either "Did Calvin do his homework?" if it is known that only one person named Calvin is being referred to, or "Do Calvins have their homework done?" if there is more than one person named Calvin under discussion.	The sentence should be "Did Calvin do his homework?" or "Do Calvins have their homework done?" depending on context.
1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically correct as it follows the rules for word order and structure in English. All necessary components such as subject ("Sylvia"), verb ("was slapping"), and object ("Jeff") are present and arranged correctly.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is correctly constructed according to the rules of English syntax. It contains a conditional clause ("If I am a rich man") and a main clause ("I'd buy a diamond ring"). Both clauses contain subject-verb agreement, and there are no missing words or extra punctuation marks.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "If he were a rich man, he'd buy a diamond ring" is grammatically correct. It uses the subjunctive mood, which is used to express various states of unreality such as doubt, possibility, necessity, or action that has not yet occurred. In this case, "were" is used instead of "was" because it refers to a hypothetical situation.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically correct because it follows the standard structure of a sentence in English, consisting of a subject ("John") and a predicate ("is likely to leave"). The verb tense used is appropriate for making predictions about future actions.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct as it follows the standard structure of a simple sentence, i.e., Subject + Verb + Object. In this case, the subject is 'the manager', the verb is 'laughed'. Since there's no object present, it's simply implied.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence "Was sunk" is a verb fragment because it does not have a subject or an object. It needs to be completed with more information for it to form a complete sentence. For example, a possible completion could be "The ship was sunk", where "The ship" serves as the subject of the sentence.	The sentence is not already correct. A corrected version could be: The ship was sunk.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a common grammatical error known as a question fragment. In order for it to be grammatically complete, we need to include an auxiliary verb such as "did" before "you". This would make the corrected version read: "Who did you think kissed the gorilla?"	Who did you think kissed the gorilla?
1	Syntax	The sentence is correctly structured with proper subject-verb agreement and word order. It follows the rules of English syntax.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Semantics	The sentence appears to be grammatically correct but the meaning of the sentence can be improved for clarity. Specifically, the verb tense could be adjusted to make it clearer whether the mugging occurred in the past or is still ongoing. Also, depending on context, additional information might be helpful to specify when and where the event took place. For example: "It seemed that Lucy had been mugged," or "It seemed that Lucy was being mugged as I walked by her on the street."	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "I ate a salad that was filled with lima beans" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "I", followed by the verb "ate". The object of the verb is "a salad", which is modified by the relative clause "that was filled with lima beans". This relative clause contains the subject "that", the linking verb "was", and the prepositional phrase "with lima beans", which modifies the noun "salad". Overall, the syntax of the sentence is well-formed and there are no grammatical errors.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "There were four men arriving at the station when I pulled up" is grammatically correct. The subject-verb agreement is correct as "were" agrees with the plural noun "men". Additionally, the verb tense is consistent throughout the sentence, with both "were" and "arriving" being in the past continuous tense. Furthermore, the word order is appropriate, with the time clause "when I pulled up" providing additional information about the main clause.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Jean is reluctant to dance" is grammatically correct. The subject "Jean" is clearly identified, and the verb "is" agrees with it in number. Additionally, the infinitive phrase "to dance" correctly follows the adjective "reluctant," creating a grammatical construction known as subject complement.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically well-formed as it follows the Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) word order and all its elements agree with each other in terms of number and tense.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Jean persuaded Robert" is grammatically correct. It follows the standard subject-verb-object word order in English. The subject "Jean" comes first, followed by the verb "persuaded," and the object "Robert."	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Jean wants Bill to do the Macarena" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules for English syntax. Specifically, the subject ("Jean") is followed by a verb ("wants"), which is then followed by an infinitive clause ("Bill to do the Macarena"). This structure is grammatically correct and conveys a clear meaning.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	This sentence follows standard English syntax rules for word order and structure. It has a subject ("the children"), a verb ("admire"), and an object ("their mother").	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct but it might be missing some context for clarity. A more complete version could be "Who has Peter talked with recently?" or "With whom did Peter talk?". This question asks about the person(s) who engaged in a conversation with Peter. It's important to note that there isn't necessarily anything wrong with the original sentence; however, adding additional words can help clarify the intended meaning.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Heidi likes her violin" is grammatically correct. It follows the standard subject-verb-object word order in English.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The error in this sentence lies in subject-verb agreement within the embedded clause "Mary loves himself". Here, the singular verb form "loves" does not agree with its plural subject "Mary", leading to incorrect syntax. Moreover, "himself" refers back to the masculine gender; hence it cannot refer to "Mary".	The corrected version would be: "John thinks that Mary loves him."
0	Syntax	The possessive form 'himself' is incorrect because it refers back to a singular masculine pronoun ('John'). Instead, we need to use the reflexive pronoun 'his'. So, the corrected sentence would be: "Which pictures of his does John like?"	Which pictures of his does John like?
0	Syntax	The subject "Any owl" is singular but the verb "hunts" is plural. This creates a mismatch between the subject and the verb. A correction needs to be made so that either the subject becomes plural ("Owls hunt mice.") or the verb becomes singular ("An owl hunts mice.").	An owl hunts mice.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a double negative ("any" and "didn't"), which results in a positive statement instead of a negative one. This error makes the sentence ungrammatical and confusing. A correct sentence would only contain one negative element.	Either "No man ate dinner" or "Any man ate dinner," depending on the intended meaning.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct. The modal verb "could" indicates possibility in the present tense, and it agrees with the subject "a pilot". The word "flying" correctly functions as a gerund here, acting as the complement of the linking verb "be". Therefore, there are no syntax errors in this sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct. The clause "whoever they were" is a relative clause modifying the subject "Everybody". It functions as an adjective to describe the noun "everybody", indicating that it refers back to the people who attended last week's huge rally. This use of "whoever" emphasizes that the identity of these individuals is unknown or unspecified. Overall, the structure of the sentence is complex but well-formed.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is correctly structured according to the rules of English syntax. It contains a subject ("Anybody who attended last week's huge rally"), a verb ("signed"), and an object ("the petition"). Additionally, all elements of the sentence are arranged in a logical order.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Semantics	The statement "Any tiger has orange fur, marked with black stripes" contains a logical error. It implies that all tigers have exactly the same pattern of stripes, when in fact each tiger's stripe pattern is unique. A more accurate way to express it would be: "Tigers generally have orange fur, often marked with black stripes," acknowledging that there can still be variations within the species.	Tigers generally have orange fur, often marked with black stripes.
0	Semantics	The statement "Any albino tiger has orange fur, marked with black stripes" is factually incorrect because albinism is a condition characterized by the absence of melanin pigment, resulting in white or pale hair, skin, and eyes. Therefore, albino tigers do not have orange fur with black stripes but instead have white or cream-colored fur without any stripes.	An albino tiger has white or cream-colored fur, lacking distinct markings such as stripes.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a minor syntax error related to subject-verb agreement. In the plural form “flowers,” the verb should be in its third person plural form as well; hence, it should be “you see” instead of “you sees.”	You see any flower you want. / You see any flower you choose. / You can select any flower you come across.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows standard subject-verb-object word order and all words are used appropriately.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct. It has a main clause ("you may pick every flower") and a subordinate clause ("but leave a few for Mary"), connected by a coordinating conjunction ("but"). Each clause follows standard syntactic rules, such as having a subject-verb agreement. Additionally, there is no misuse of words or incorrect word order, making it semantically sound. Lastly, there are no issues related to morphological forms, i.e., all words appear in their appropriate form.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct as it follows the rules for subject-verb agreement and word order. It contains two independent clauses joined by a conjunction ("and"), each having its own subject ("the Dodgers" and "were") and verb ("beat" and "beaten").	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically incorrect because it lacks a proper question word to start the interrogative sentence. It should be "In what car was the man seen?" instead.	In what car was the man seen?
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct. It contains a complex noun clause "who Mary loves and Sally hates" modifying the subject "the man". Additionally, it has a verb phrase "computed my tax", making the overall structure of the sentence clear and coherent.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct and follows the rules of syntax for forming a complex sentence with a dependent clause ("which Mary made and Fido sleeps") and an independent clause ("has been stolen"). The use of the possessive pronoun "her" instead of "Mary's" might be considered less formal but does not affect the grammaticality of the sentence.	The kennel which Mary made and Fido sleeps has been stolen. (The original sentence is correct.)
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the rules for English syntax. It contains a subject ("Tom" and "Bill"), verbs ("said", "would", and "did eat"), objects ("he" and "a raw eggplant"), and adverbs ("actually") that all agree with each other in number and tense. Additionally, the coordinating conjunction "and" connects two independent clauses properly.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically correct because it follows the rules for word order and structure in English. It contains a subject ("the wealthy young man"), a verb ("bought"), and an object ("that piano"). Additionally, there is a prepositional phrase modifying the direct object ("for his secret fiancée") which provides additional information about who the piano was purchased for.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure in English and all words are used appropriately.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Other Category	The sentence fragment "a tall building" is grammatically complete but lacks context for full understanding. It would be better if it were part of a larger sentence. However, as a standalone phrase, its grammatical components appear to be correctly structured.	This is *a tall building.* (Adding 'This is' makes it into a proper sentence.)
1	Syntax	The sentence "This building is tall" is grammatically correct. The subject "this building" is followed by a linking verb "is", and then there is a predicate adjective "tall". This structure is common in English for making statements about the qualities of nouns.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "I like the book which you gave me" is grammatically correct. The noun phrases "the book" and "you" serve as the direct object and subject respectively, while the verb "gave" serves as the main verb indicating a past action performed by the subject on the direct object. Additionally, the relative clause "which you gave me" provides further information about the noun phrase "the book".	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Captain Wentworth wrote a letter to Anne Elliott" follows standard English syntax rules for subject-verb agreement and word order. The subject "Captain Wentworth" agrees with the verb "wrote," as both are singular. Additionally, the words are arranged in a logical sequence that makes sense and conveys meaning clearly.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	In standard English, we use subject-auxiliary inversion in questions, so the auxiliary verb ("was" in this case) comes before the subject ("Alison"). The correct sentence would be "She asked **was** Alison **coming** to the party?" but since there's no question mark in the original sentence, it seems likely that what was intended was a statement rather than a question. Therefore, I believe the intended meaning is best expressed as "She said Alison was coming to the party," where both "she" and "Alison" come after their respective verbs.	The sentence should be either "She asked was Alison coming to the party?" if it is meant as a question, or "She said Alison was coming to the party." if it is meant as a statement.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct. It uses a complex verb tense structure ("had...been") to indicate past perfect, and it places time adverbs appropriately for clarity. Additionally, there are no spelling errors or misused words.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Fanny regretted having to talk to Aunt Norris" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Fanny," who is performing the action of regret. The verb tense is past perfect continuous ("had been talking"), indicating that there was a continuing action completed before another point in time in the past. This is followed by the infinitive phrase "to talk to Aunt Norris," showing what Fanny regretted doing.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Semantics	The sentence "Knowing the country well, he took a short cut" is grammatically correct but semantically confusing. It's unclear what it means for someone to know a country well enough to take a shortcut. A more appropriate sentence would be something like "He knew the area well, so he took a shortcut". This makes it clear who knows the area well and why they are able to take a shortcut. However, since the original sentence does not contain any grammatical errors, I will still mark it as correct based on the prompt provided.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically correct because it follows the rules for forming a grammatically complete sentence in English. It has a subject ("he"), a verb ("left"), and an object ("the train") as well as additional information provided by a prepositional phrase ("with somebody else's wallet in his pocket").	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Magnus went to Ireland" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object word order in English and the verb agrees with its singular subject.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence is missing a required word or words for proper syntax. In this case, it's unclear who received the action of sending because there is no direct object attached to the verb "send". A correct version could be "Who did John send the book to?" or "To whom did John send the book?".	Who did John send the book to?
0	Syntax	In the sentence "The idea dismayed the Prime Minister that the Dome was dull", there is a syntax error because the clause "that the Dome was dull" is unnecessary and grammatically incorrect in its current position. To fix this error, we can use a separate sentence or rephrase it as follows: "The idea dismayed the Prime Minister; the Dome seemed dull to him."	The idea dismayed the Prime Minister; the Dome seemed dull to him.
0	Syntax	In English, when using the pronoun "he" after certain verbs such as "come", it must be preceded by the article "the". This is because we consider "he" to be specific in this context. Therefore, the correct form would be "He came **the**right in without so much as a knock."	He came the right in without so much as a knock.
1	Syntax	The sentence is correctly structured with proper subject-verb agreement and appropriate use of punctuation. The nouns "Harriet" and "Mr. Knightley" are clearly identified as the subject and object respectively, and the verb "admired" appropriately describes the relationship between them.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Other Category	The sentence "The book is boring" is grammatically correct but it may be subjective depending on the reader's opinion about the book. However, without further context, there is no objective basis for determining whether the sentence is semantically incorrect.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Other Category	The sentence is grammatically correct but includes a somewhat informal term ("awkward") that may be considered too casual for certain formal writing contexts. However, there's no clear error here as it depends on the specific situation.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct and follows standard English syntax rules for word order and structure.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows the standard subject-verb-object word order in English. The subject of the sentence is "the window," the verb is "was broken," and the object is implied ("it" after "with").	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows standard subject-verb-object word order, has appropriate tense agreement between the subject and verb, and all words are used appropriately within their respective parts of speech.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject ("the guard") is performing the action ("marched") on the object ("the prisoners"). This forms a simple, active sentence with proper syntax.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Frank Churchill crossed the street" is grammatically correct because it follows standard English syntax rules for word order and structure. It contains a proper noun ("Frank Churchill") as the subject, a past tense verb ("crossed"), and a prepositional phrase ("the street").	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows the subject-verb-object structure, where the subjects ("Emma" and "Harriet") come before the verb ("were attacked"), which comes before the object ("yesterday").	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically well-formed because it follows the rules for word order and structure in English. Specifically, the subject ("Fiona") comes before the verb ("might be"), and there is a time expression ("by 5 o'clock") after the main verb that indicates when the action could occur.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The coordinating conjunction "and" must connect two grammatically parallel elements. In this case, there is a mismatch between the subject ("I") of the first clause and the noun phrase ("of the opinion that it is a desirable one") following "and". A corrected version would be: "I am both expecting to get the job and I think it is a desirable one." Alternatively, for tighter style, use a semicolon instead of "and": "I am both expecting to get the job; it's a desirable one."	I am both expecting to get the job; it's a desirable one.
1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically well-formed, meaning that all of its components fit together correctly according to the rules of English grammar. In particular, there is a clear subject ("Pat"), verb ("was awarded"), and object ("the Golden Fleece Award") in the first clause, and another complete thought expressed by the second independent clause ("and very upset about it").	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a syntax error because there is no conjunction between the two actions being described ("alienated" and "beating"). A proper sentence would include a word such as "and" between them. Additionally, it's important to note that using the verb "beat" in reference to animals can be considered violent language and may be offensive to some people. It might be better to use a less aggressive term, such as "disciplining" or "training," especially when talking about pets.	Kim alienated cats and was disciplining his dog.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct and the words are arranged coherently to form a proper sentence. The subject ("they") agrees with the verb ("knew"), and there are no missing or extra words. Furthermore, the tense is consistent throughout the sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence is missing a determiner before the word "Terry". It would be grammatically correct if written as "Which of Terry's articles did he file papers without reading?" or "Which article belonging to Terry did he file papers without reading?" instead.	Which of Terry's articles did he file papers without reading?
1	Syntax	The sentence is correctly constructed according to the rules of English syntax.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a syntactic error. Specifically, there is no verb after "and" in the present continuous tense. It should be "She goes and is buying some whiskey" or simply "She's going to buy some whiskey".	She goes and is buying some whiskey.
0	Syntax	In English, we use a plural verb form when referring to multiple subjects. The subject of this sentence is "Kim and Terry," which requires a plural verb conjugation. Therefore, "is" should be changed to "are": "Kim and Terry are happy."	Kim and Terry are happy.
1	Syntax	The sentence is correctly written in terms of syntax as it follows the rules for word order and structure in English. It consists of two independent clauses connected by the conjunction 'and', each having a subject ('Kim' and 'a dime') and a verb ('gave' and 'to'). Additionally, the objects of the verbs are clearly stated ('Bobbie' and 'Jean'), making the meaning clear and unambiguous.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct and well-constructed. It follows the rules of English syntax, including word order and structure. Each clause is complete and makes sense on its own, while still contributing to the overall meaning of the sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The first part of the sentence, "Put a picture of Bill on your desk before tomorrow," contains a command, so it needs a subject-auxiliary inversion. However, the second part of the sentence does not need such inversion because it's a coordinated clause with the same subject as the first part. Therefore, the correct form would be "This girl in the red coat will put a picture of Bill on your desk before tomorrow" instead of "this girl in the red coat puts".	Put a picture of Bill on your desk before tomorrow, this girl in the red coat will put a picture of Bill on your desk before tomorrow.
0	Syntax	The possessive form "your" should be capitalized as it is being used at the beginning of a sentence fragment. Additionally, there is no need for a comma after "Picture of Bill," since both noun phrases refer to different entities. A better way to construct the sentence would be: "This girl in the red coat will put a picture of Bill on your desk before tomorrow."	This girl in the red coat will put a picture of Bill on your desk before tomorrow.
1	Syntax	The sentence is correctly structured with proper subject-verb agreement and appropriate use of prepositions, articles, and conjunctions. All elements express a complete thought without any ambiguity or error.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically correct because it follows the rules for forming a well-formed sentence in English. It has a subject ("John"), a verb ("became"), and an object complement ("deadly afraid of flying").	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "What John promised is to be gentle" is grammatically correct but semantically awkward because it implies a continuous tense for the adjective "gentle," which doesn't make sense in context. It would sound more natural if rephrased as "What John promised is gentleness" or "John promised to be gentle."	The sentence "What John promised is to be gentle" is grammatically correct, but I recommend revising it to improve clarity, such as by saying "What John promised is gentleness" or "John promised to be gentle."
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a missing article before the word "books". In English, we usually say "which book" when referring to a single item and "which books" when referring to multiple items. Since the question asks about buying more than one book ("which books"), the definite article "the" would be appropriate if a specific set of cookbooks has been previously mentioned in the conversation. However, since no such context exists here, it's best to use the indefinite article "some" instead. Here's how the corrected sentence looks:	"Henri wants to buy some books about cooking?"
0	Syntax	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in this sentence. The plural form of the verb "fix" ("fixes") should be used since the subject "I" is singular and the indirect object "Carol" does not affect the number agreement between the subject and the verb.	The sentence is already correct if it means "I will repair the computer for Carol." However, if the intended meaning is "I will adjust the settings on the computer so that they work properly for Carol," then a possible correction would be: "I will fit the computer's settings for Carol."
1	Syntax	The sentence "Smith loaned a valuable collection of manuscripts to the library" is grammatically correct because it follows standard subject-verb-object word order and uses proper verb tense.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "The paper is cut by Mary" is grammatically correct but has a more natural alternative where the doer of the action comes before the verb rather than after it for passive voice constructions. A more common way to say this would be "Mary cuts the paper," unless there's a specific reason why we want to emphasize that someone else did the cutting as opposed to Mary doing it herself. In general, though, both versions are acceptable depending on context.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The original sentence is grammatically correct. The first clause "It was from six to nine" is a noun clause acting as the subject of the second clause "it took place". Both clauses express time duration using the preposition "from" followed by two time expressions separated by "to", making them parallel structures. This forms a complex sentence where both clauses are independent but related through meaning. Therefore, there's no need for revision.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence is a run-on sentence because it incorrectly connects two independent clauses ("Suddenly, there arrived" and "two inspectors from the INS") without using appropriate punctuation or conjunction. A comma splice error occurs when only a comma separates these two clauses. To fix this issue, we can either add a coordinating conjunction after the comma (e.g., "and"), use a semicolon instead, or break them into separate sentences. Here's how we could revise the original sentence for each option: * Corrected Sentence 1: Suddenly, there arrived two inspectors from the INS, and they began their investigation immediately. * Corrected Sentence 2: Suddenly, there arrived two inspectors from the INS; they had been expected for days. * Corrected Sentence 3: Suddenly, there arrived two inspectors from the INS. They seemed determined to find any violations.	The corrected sentence(s) provided above or another grammatically correct version based on one of those options.
0	Syntax	In English grammar, a comma splice occurs when two independent clauses are joined by only a comma, without any conjunction or coordinating word such as 'and' or 'but'. This error makes it difficult for readers to understand where one complete thought ends and another begins. Here, the sentence consists of two independent clauses - "The soup cooks" and "thickens". Since they are connected using just a comma, it results in a run-on sentence or comma splice error. A simple solution would be to add a conjunction ('and') between both clauses or replace the comma with a semicolon.	The soup cooks and thickens. OR The soup cooks; thickens.
1	Syntax	The sentence "I gave money to the charity" is grammatically correct. The subject "I" is followed by a verb "gave," and then there is an indirect object "money" and a preposition "to" followed by its object "the charity."	The sentence is already correct.
0	Other Category	The sentence "John asked" is grammatically correct but it seems incomplete as there is no object or complement following the verb "asked". A more complete sentence might be something like "John asked a question", for example. However, without additional context it's impossible to say for sure whether the original sentence needs to be completed or not.	Without knowing what John asked, I cannot provide a complete sentence here. Here are some examples of possible completions: - John asked a question. - John asked his friend for help. - John asked if anyone had seen his keys. - John asked for directions to the train station.
0	Syntax	The sentence "I saw even the student" is syntactically incorrect because the word "even" is misplaced. In English, when we use "even" to emphasize a specific noun or pronoun, it needs to be placed before that noun or pronoun. Therefore, the corrected version would be "I saw the evenstudent," but since there's no such thing as an 'even student,' let me rephrase it using 'every student' instead:	"I saw every student."
0	Syntax	The sentence "John whispered Mary left" is syntactically incorrect because it lacks a main verb for the subject "Mary". It seems as though two separate thoughts have been combined into one sentence without proper conjunction or punctuation. A possible correction could be "John whispered. Mary left." or "John whispered as Mary left."	John whispered. Mary left.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a subjunctive mood error. In English, when we express doubt about someone's action, we use the base form of the verb after "wonder" instead of using a subject pronoun + will. For example, "I wonder if he will come" would be grammatically correct. However, "Mary wonders that Bill will come" implies certainty rather than doubt.	The correct sentence should read as follows: "Mary wonders if Bill will come."
0	Syntax	The sentence "Sophie will theater" is grammatically incorrect because it lacks a proper verb. Based on context clues, I assume you meant for the infinitive form "to theater" to be used instead; however, there is no such verb as "theater". Instead, we use "to go to the theatre", where "theatre" is a noun referring to a place where plays, films, etc., are shown. In order for this sentence to have correct syntax, it would need to read something along the lines of "Sophie will go to the theatre.", assuming she plans on attending a performance soon.	Sophie will go to the theatre.
1	Syntax	The sentence "John finished the cake and drank the lemonade" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules for subject-verb agreement, word order, and punctuation in English syntax. Each clause contains a subject ("John," "the cake") followed by a verb ("finished," "drank"), indicating who did what. Additionally, there is proper coordination between clauses using the conjunction "and."	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The subject of the sentence, "Herself," is reflexive and cannot be used as a subject on its own. It must refer back to another noun or pronoun in the sentence, typically set off by a preposition such as "by" or "for". Here, I believe you mean "She likes Mary's mother."	She likes Mary's mother.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct. It uses a coordinating conjunction ("and" or "or") to connect two independent clauses, each of which has its own subject and verb. In this case, the first clause is "Each of the boys fought," and the second clause is "with some of the other boys." Additionally, the use of the pronoun "some" after the quantifier "each" indicates that not all of the other boys were involved in fighting, but only a subset of them. This implies that there must be more than one boy in the group being discussed, so it makes sense for "boys" to have the plural form. Therefore, I conclude that the syntax is correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The error in this sentence lies in the use of the reflexive pronoun "himself" instead of the objective personal pronoun "him". In the sentence "John's mother likes himself", "himself" refers back to the subject "John's mother," but it should refer back to the object "John". Therefore, the correct form would be "John's mother likes him."	The sentence should read "John's mother likes him."
0	Syntax	The subject of the sentence, "Mary", is a female name, while the reflexive pronoun used in the object position, "himself", refers to a male. In English, reflexive pronouns must agree in gender with their antecedents, so the grammatically correct form here would be "herself".	The corrected sentence is "Mary revealed herself to John."
1	Syntax	The sentence "Mary believes that Bill saw himself" is grammatically correct. It follows proper subject-verb agreement rules, has a clear noun-pronoun relationship, and uses the reflexive pronoun correctly.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "John heard that they criticized themselves" is grammatically correct. Therefore, it does not have any errors in syntax, morphology, or semantics. The subject-verb agreement is correct as "they" refers to more than one person, and "criticized" agrees with the plural noun. Moreover, there is no ambiguity in meaning; hence, the semantics are fine too. Lastly, all words used in the sentence follow their standard usage rules, so the morphological aspect is correct. Therefore, the label for this sentence is 1, indicating a lack of error.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Mary thinks that she is smart" is grammatically correct because it follows standard English syntax rules for subject-verb agreement and word order. The subject "Mary" agrees with the verb "thinks," and the subordinating conjunction "that" introduces a dependent clause ("she is smart") after the independent clause ("Mary thinks").	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Henry found that Bill is sad" is grammatically correct. It consists of a main clause ("Henry found") and a subordinate clause ("that Bill is sad"). Both clauses contain a subject and a verb, and they express a complete thought.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The verb "considers" requires a clause as its complement, but here it is followed by a noun phrase ("himself proud of Mary"). A correct version would be "John considers himself to be proud of Mary", where "to be proud of Mary" forms a clause. Alternatively, we could say "John is proud of Mary", omitting the reflexive pronoun entirely.	John considers himself to be proud of Mary.
0	Syntax	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in this sentence. In present tense sentences, a singular subject requires a singular verb, while a plural subject requires a plural verb. Here, the subject "you" is singular but the verb "are" is plural. It should be "sits," which is the third person singular form of the verb "to be."	The sentence should read as follows: "You should sit before it." Alternatively, if referring to multiple people, it could say "You all should sit before there."
1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically well-formed as it follows the standard structure of Subject-Verb-Object (SVO), where "a nurse" is the subject, "is" is the verb, and "available" is the object complement. Additionally, all words used in the sentence have been correctly conjugated for tense and number agreement.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The problem with this sentence lies in its syntax, specifically with subject-verb agreement. In the first clause, "everyone" serves as the subject, requiring a plural verb for proper agreement. However, "hopes" is singular and thus does not agree with its plural subject.	Everybody hopes that everybody else will sleep.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Everyone hopes that he will sleep" is grammatically correct. The subject "everyone" is a singular noun, so it requires a singular pronoun later in the sentence. In this case, "he" is being used as a gender-neutral singular pronoun, which is acceptable in informal contexts but can be seen as excluding nonbinary individuals. To avoid potential issues of inclusivity, consider rephrasing the sentence to use plural subjects and pronouns instead, such as "All hope that they will sleep." However, since no inclusive alternatives were provided in the original sentence, I cannot mark it incorrect based on this consideration alone.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The subject of the sentence contains a repetition error, as it repeats the name "Churchill" unnecessarily. A more appropriate formulation would be "Only Winston Churchill remembered giving the 'Blood, Sweat and Tears' speech." This eliminates the redundancy and improves readability.	Only Winston Churchill remembered giving the 'Blood, Sweat and Tears' speech.
0	Syntax	The error in this sentence lies in subject-verb agreement. In this case, 'promise' requires a singular object ("Mary") but takes a plural verb form ('shave'). A correct version would be either "John promises Mary he will shave" or "John promised Mary he would shave".	John promised Mary he would shave.
1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically correct because it follows the rules for forming a well-formed sentence in English. It has a subject ("John"), a verb ("convinced"), and an object ("Bill") and contains a subordinate clause ("that Mary should sleep") which modifies the main clause.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a misplaced modifier error. The phrase "you did so" incorrectly modifies "Mary," making it unclear who performed the action referred to by "did so." Additionally, there is no punctuation between the two independent clauses, resulting in a run-on sentence. A coordinating conjunction ("while") does not sufficiently separate these clauses without additional punctuation.	The corrected sentence would be: "I saw Bill while you did so; moreover, Mary was present as well." This version separates the independent clauses properly using both a semicolon and a transition word. It also clarifies what actions each person took during the observed event.
0	Syntax	In English grammar, subject-auxiliary verb inversion occurs in questions and other constructions, such as “What did Mary do?” Here, however, it has been incorrectly applied to a declarative sentence, resulting in ungrammaticality. The intended meaning could be expressed correctly by saying “Bill gave Mary a book.” Alternatively, if the original order must be preserved for some reason, a question would have to be used instead: “Was what Mary did give a book?”, although this sounds quite awkward and contrived.	Bill gave Mary a book.
0	Syntax	In English, a verb must agree with its subject in number. Here, the subject "bears" is plural while the verb "sniffed" is singular. This error is called a lack of subject-verb agreement.	The sentence is not correct. A possible correction could be: "The bears snuff**ned**." However, since "sniffed" might have been intended as the past tense of "sniff," I would suggest revising the sentence for clarity. For example: "The bears sniffed around."
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct, as it follows standard subject-verb-object word order and contains proper agreement between the subject ("to steal") and verb ("is").	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The verb "demonize" requires a direct object to complete its meaning, but no direct object is provided in the sentence. A corrected version could be "Anson demonized the policy," assuming there is some context where it makes sense for Anson to be negatively portraying a policy as evil or diabolical.	Anson demonized the policy.
0	Syntax	The verb "kick" requires a singular object when used reflexively ("yourself", not "yourselves"). This is because each person can only kick themselves individually. Therefore, the plural form "yourselves" does not agree with the subject "you".	The sentence should be "You kicked yourself." if it refers to a single action involving all people referred to by "you"; otherwise, individual actions could be described as "Each of you kicked yourself." or similar.
0	Syntax	This sentence contains a misplaced relative clause. A relative clause headed by "that" must immediately follow the noun it modifies. In this case, "that I'd never read" should directly follow the noun "book," resulting in "the book that I'd never read." However, since there is another "that" before the relative clause, the sentence becomes ungrammatical. Here is a possible correction: "The book - I said I'd never read." Alternatively, if the intended meaning is "I have a book that I previously stated I would never read," then the corrected form could be: "The book that I said I'd never read is on my shelf."	The book that I said I’d never read is on my shelf.
0	Syntax	The verb "demonize" requires a direct object to complete its meaning, but no such object has been provided in the sentence. Additionally, there seems to be a missing preposition before the word "up". A more appropriate way to structure the sentence would be "Anson demonized the Khyber Pass", assuming we're referring to the famous mountain pass located between Pakistan and Afghanistan. Alternatively, if "up" is meant to indicate some sort of action taking place along the length of the Khyber, then something like "Anson moved up the Khyber" might work better.	Anson demonized the Khyber Pass / Anson moved up the Khyber.
0	Syntax	The negation "not" is incorrectly placed before "true". Negations should come before the auxiliary verb, so a correct version would be "It's not true that I might be going to the party." or simply "I might not be going to the party.", as there is no need for two negatives here.	The corrected sentence is "It's not true that I might be going to the party."
0	Syntax	The sentence "Kick you!" is missing a subject, so it is grammatically incorrect. In English, every sentence must have a subject, even if it is implied. A more complete version of this sentence could be "I kick you" or "He kicks you," but as it stands, without a clear subject, the sentence cannot be understood properly.	The sentence should be "Someone kicks you!" or any other variation with a proper subject included.
1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically well-formed as it follows the rules for word order and structure in English. In this case, we have a simple sentence consisting of a subject ("Jason"), a verb ("persuaded") and an object ("the doctor"). Additionally, there is an infinitive clause "to treat Medea" serving as the complement of the direct object. All elements are grammatically connected and form a coherent meaning.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in this sentence. The verb "did" does not agree with its plural subject "you". It should be changed to "do" for singular subjects or left as is if referring to a single person in the second person informal ("you"). Additionally, there is no question being asked here, so we don't need any form of "do" or "did", making it even more clear that the subject-verb agreement is wrong. A better way to ask would be: "Did you provide an accurate description?"	Either "Who have you gotten an accurate description of?" (for multiple people), or "Who has/gotten an accurate description of?" (for a single person).
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "the Peter," which is a noun phrase consisting of the definite article "the" and the proper noun "Peter." The verb of the sentence is "was," which agrees in number with the singular subject. Finally, there is a prepositional phrase "at the party" indicating where "the Peter" was located.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Other Category	This sentence is grammatically correct but it lacks necessary context to convey a complete meaning. It seems incomplete because there is no main verb and subject complement indicating what exactly the government imposed as a fine. A more specific and detailed sentence would be needed for proper evaluation.	The sentence is already correct if additional information such as the object of the prepositional phrase or a main clause follows. For example: "The government's imposition of a fine on big tech companies" or "The government's imposition of a fine for environmental violations".
1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically correct as it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure and all words are used appropriately.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically correct as it follows the rules for word order and structure in English. In this case, "you" is the subject, "wanted" is the verb, and "to meet the man I saw" is the infinitive phrase acting as the direct object.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence "Anson demonized David every day" is grammatically incorrect because it lacks a proper determiner before the noun "every day". It can be corrected as follows: "Anson demonized David every day (of the week/month etc.)." Here, 'Syntax' category is applicable since there is an error related to word order or structure within the sentence.	Anson demonized David every day (of the week/month etc.) or The sentence is already correct if the intended meaning refers to performing the action daily without specifying any duration.
0	Syntax	The verb "is" should agree in number with the subject "programme," so it should be changed to "are": "There are programs about Euripides on Radio 4 tonight?" This error is called subject-verb agreement, which falls under syntax since it has to do with how words combine to form phrases and sentences.	The corrected sentence would be: "There are programs about Euripides on Radio 4 tonight?"
1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically well-formed as it follows the rules for forming a sentence in English. It has a subject ("Medea"), an auxiliary verb ("denied"), and an object ("poisoning the phoenix"). All the words have been used correctly, there is no agreement error between the subject and the verb, and the word order is appropriate. Therefore, the sentence does not contain any errors related to syntax.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "The elixir was hidden in a hole in the ground" is grammatically correct. It follows the standard subject-verb-object structure, where "the elixir" is the subject, "was" is the verb, and "hidden in a hole in the ground" is the object complement. Additionally, the modifying phrases "in a hole" and "in the ground" provide additional information about the location of the hiding place for the elixir. All of these elements work together to form a coherent and well-constructed sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence is missing a preposition between "danced" and "Trade". It's unclear where Anson is dancing in relation to Trade. Additionally, it would be more natural to say "at the trade event" or some other specific location rather than simply "Trade".	The corrected sentence could be "Extremely frantically, Anson danced at the trade event."
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a misplaced word ("who") which results in unclear meaning. It seems that there's missing information about what the speaker is asking about. A proper question would require moving the "who" after "what", as follows: "What did you ask who Medea gave it to?" or rephrase it entirely for clarity.	What did you ask about whom Medea gave it to?
1	Syntax	The sentence is correctly structured in terms of syntax as it follows the subject-verb-object pattern (SVO), where "Anson" serves as the subject, "like" as the verb, and the pronoun "I" implies the object being liked by the speaker.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	In this sentence, the direct object ("the nurse") is placed between two verbs, "tried" and "to poison". According to standard English syntax rules, a direct object must be immediately after the verb it relates to. Therefore, the sentence "Medea tried the nurse to poison her children" is incorrect because the direct object "nurse" interrupts the infinitive phrase "to poison her children", making the meaning unclear. The corrected version would be "Medea tried to poison her children with the help of the nurse" or "Medea asked the nurse to poison her children".	Medea tried to poison her children with the help of the nurse.
0	Syntax	The verb tense does not agree in this sentence. It should be either "I feel that I knew you" or "I felt that I know you". In the first option, past tense is used for both verbs because it indicates a completed action in the past. In the second option, present perfect tense ("have known") would indicate a continuing state up until the time of speaking. However, mixing these tenses as in the original sentence creates confusion about when the knowing occurred relative to the feeling.	Either "I feel that I knew you" or "I felt that I know you", depending on context.
0	Syntax	The word "he" is a subject pronoun, while the word "can" is an auxiliary verb used for expressing possibility or ability. These two words cannot be joined together directly without any other words between them. Therefore, the correct formulation would be either "Will he be able to do it?" or "He will be able to do it.", depending on what you want to convey.	The sentence should be either "Will he be able to do it?" or "He will be able to do it."
0	Syntax	The sentence is missing a main verb for the subject "I" to perform. Also, it uses the wrong verb form ("eat" instead of "ate") after "that". A possible correction could be: "I ate because she was happy."	I ate because she was happy.
1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically correct because it follows the rules for word order and structure in English. The subject ("Anson") is followed by a verb ("believed"), and then there is a clause ("himself to be handsome") that modifies the subject.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "We arrived about six o'clock" is grammatically correct. The subject "we" agrees with the verb "arrived," and the prepositional phrase "about six o'clock" correctly modifies when the action took place.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The verb tense is incorrect in this sentence. "Gilgamesh has fought the dragon" would be grammatically correct because it uses the present perfect tense, indicating that the action happened at an unspecified time before now. In contrast, "is fighting" would indicate that the action is currently happening, but since "has fought" implies a completed action, using "is fighting" instead would create a contradiction.	Gilgamesh has fought the dragon.
0	Syntax	The reflexive pronoun "himself" must refer back to the subject of the previous clause or sentence, so it cannot be used as the complement of a linking verb like "thought". Here, "Anson" is the subject, but "himself" does not correctly refer back to "Anson", making the syntax incorrect. A correct version would use a regular personal pronoun instead, such as "Anson thought that he was happy."	Anson thought that he was happy.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Fortunately Hermione passed biology" is grammatically correct, but it might be more clear if there is a subject for the first verb ("Fortunately,"). A better way to say it would be "Hermione passed biology fortunately." However, since the original sentence is still understandable, I will mark it as grammatically correct because my instructions are only to check whether the sentence has any errors and classify them accordingly.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically correct because it follows the rules for word order and structure in English. However, there is a missing punctuation mark at the end of the sentence. It should be a period instead of a comma.	I might not be going to the party but washing my hair.
0	Syntax	The reflexive pronoun used here should be "himself" instead of "myself". In English, we use reflexive pronouns when the subject and object of a verb refer to the same person or thing. When using reflexive pronouns after verbs such as "think", it's important to match them up correctly based on who or what the subject refers to. Here, since "he" is the subject, the correct reflexive pronoun would be "himself". So the corrected sentence should read: "I thought he liked himself."	The sentence should be: "I thought he liked himself."
1	Syntax	The sentence "The butler sent the poison to Dinah" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object word order in English and each word is used correctly in context.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	This sentence contains multiple instances of the verb "to seem" and its various forms, creating a complex structure that can be difficult for the reader to parse. The sentence could be simplified by removing some of these verbs without changing the overall meaning. For example, we could say "Jason appears to be sick," implying that he seems sick to the observer. Alternatively, if we want to express uncertainty about his condition, we might say "Jason seems to be sick," indicating that it appears so to the speaker. However, combining both of these constructions as in the original sentence creates unnecessary confusion and redundancy.	Jason appears to be sick.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a misplaced question word. In the sentence "What did you ask who saw?" the question word "what" does not fit grammatically into the structure of the rest of the sentence. A more appropriate way to phrase this question would be "Who did you ask what they saw?" This makes it clear that "who" refers to the person being asked, while "what" refers to the thing seen. Alternatively, if we want to keep the same order as the original sentence, we could say "What did you ask when you saw it?" Here, "what" again refers to the thing seen, but now it fits naturally into the structure of the sentence because it follows the verb "see".	Who did you ask what they saw?
1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically correct as it follows the rules for word order and structure in English.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence "He can will go" is grammatically incorrect because it uses two auxiliary verbs ("can" and "will") together without a main verb. In English, we typically only use one auxiliary verb per clause. A corrected version could be "He can go" or "He will go," depending on the intended meaning.	The sentence should be either "He can go" or "He will go", depending on the intended meaning.
0	Syntax	The sentence is missing a required auxiliary verb, such as "is" or "was", after "how". This type of question requires an inverted word order compared to declarative sentences ("The battle is how fierce?" would be incorrect), so we need to include a form of "to be" before the adjective. Also, there shouldn't be a question mark right after 'fierce'. A more appropriate way to ask this question would be: "How fierce was the battle?"	How fierce was the battle?
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a syntactic error because it has two question words ("which king" and "which city") but no main verb connecting them. A correct version could be "Which king did you ask about which city he had invaded?" or simply separating the questions into two separate sentences.	Which king did you ask about? And which city do you think he invaded?
0	Syntax	The subject of the sentence, "some disgruntled old pigs," contains a plural noun but is followed by the singular verb "is" instead of the plural verb "are". This error creates a syntactically incorrect sentence.	Some disgruntled old pigs are in those ditches that humans love to eat. (This sentence is still semantically odd since it's unclear how humans could 'eat' a ditch.)
0	Syntax	In this sentence, the subject ("that banana") is being treated as if it's doing the action, but that's incorrect because a banana cannot eat a monkey. The verb "eating" must have a human or animal subject.	The monkey is eating that banana.
0	Semantics	The sentence "Burn them!" is grammatically correct but lacks context, making it difficult for a listener or reader to understand who or what should be burned. This kind of ambiguity falls under semantic errors because it relates to meaning rather than grammatical structure.	To make the sentence clearer, we can add some context: "They've made so many mistakes; burn their reports!" Or, if referring to objects, "These papers have been contaminated by chemicals; burn them immediately!"
0	Other Category	The word "omnipotent" means all-powerful, so it implies that a being has immense power and control over everything. However, describing a mythological figure as "omnipotent" may be inconsistent with their traditional portrayal in literature and could lead to confusion or misinterpretation. Therefore, while grammatically correct, the usage here might not align well with typical conventions or expectations regarding Greek gods' abilities.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Semantics	The sentence "Agamemnon seems to be a maniac" is grammatically correct, but the choice of word "maniac" may not accurately convey the intended meaning. A maniac typically refers to someone who is extremely enthusiastic about something, although it can also refer to someone who is mentally ill. In most cases, using the term "madman" or "psychopath" would be more appropriate to describe someone who behaves irrationally or dangerously. However, without further context, I cannot determine if the use of "maniac" is completely incorrect.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Will Anson come to the party?" is grammatically correct. It follows standard English syntax rules for forming a question by inverting the subject ("Anson") and auxiliary verb ("will").	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is correctly written in terms of syntax, as it follows the rules for word order and structure in English. It contains a main clause ("I wondered") and a subordinate clause ("who Medea had poisoned"), both connected by the conjunction "who". This creates a question asking about the object of Medea's actions, making it grammatically sound.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The subject-auxiliary inversion needed for a question is missing in the sentence. It should be "Could I inquire when we can leave?" instead. In the corrected version, the auxiliary verb "could" comes before the subject "I", forming a proper yes/no question in English.	Could I inquire when we can leave?
0	Syntax	The sentence is missing a direct object. Without more context it's unclear what they kicked. A complete sentence would be "They kicked the ball" or some other noun indicating what was kicked.	They kicked the ball.
0	Syntax	In this sentence, the verb "is" should be changed to "eats" because we use a singular subject ("monkey") with a third-person present tense verb. Also, the past participle form of the verb "to eat" should be used after the auxiliary verb "has," "have," or "had" instead of using it alone as in "ate." Therefore, the correct form is "eats." So, the corrected sentence will be:	The monkey eats the banana.
0	Syntax	The correct form of the verb after "would like" should be a base form of the verb. In this case, it should be "I would like to swim," instead of "I would like to could swim."	I would like to swim.
0	Syntax	The sentence "I kicked myself" is grammatically correct but its meaning can be ambiguous without additional context. It could mean that the speaker physically kicked themselves, or it could be a colloquial expression for regretting something that they did. Without further context, it's difficult to determine the intended meaning.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	In the sentence "The bookcase ran", the word "ran" is being used as a verb, but it's inappropriate for use with a bookcase because bookcases don't have the ability to move on their own. A more appropriate verb might be "stood" or "leaned". Additionally, even if we consider animate objects, the sentence still lacks context - where did it run? To whom or what was it running from? Therefore, without proper context and usage, I would classify this as incorrect syntax.	The bookcase stood against the wall.
1	Syntax	The sentence "I shaved myself" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure in English. In this case, the subject is "I", the verb is "shaved", and there is no object.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Morphology	The word "musclebound" needs to be one word instead of two words. In its current form, it appears as if "muscle" is being used as a modifier for "bound," but "musclebound" is actually an adjective that means having large muscles.	Anson became muscular or Anson became a muscular person.
