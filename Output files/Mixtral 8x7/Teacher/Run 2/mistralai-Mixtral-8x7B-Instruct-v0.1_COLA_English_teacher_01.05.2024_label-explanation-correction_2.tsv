label	explanation	correction
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple sentence with a subject ("the sailors"), verb ("rode"), and object complement ("the breeze"). There are no grammatical errors such as incorrect word order, spelling mistakes, or missing punctuation marks.	The sentence is already correct.
0	In this sentence, there is a preposition error. Instead of "over," we need to use the preposition "over" when referring to something being physically on top of something else. However, in this context, since the rope is being stretched because of the weight, we would want to say that it is stretching "across" the pulley instead of simply resting on top of it.	The weights made the rope stretch across the pulley.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "Mechanical" describes the type of doll it is. * "Wriggled" indicates what action the doll took to free itself. * "Itself" refers back to the subject ("doll") and shows that the doll performed the action without any external help.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows the rule of conditional sentences where the if-clause describes a hypothetical situation in the past using the past perfect tense ("If + subject + had + past participle"), and the main clause uses the modal verb "would" to express a consequence in the present. In this case, "you had eaten more" serves as the if-clause, and "you would want less" is the main clause.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in this sentence. "As you eat" is singular, so the verb should also be singular. However, "want" is plural. Therefore, the correct form of the verb should be used to match the subject.	As you eat the most, you wants the least. (This sentence is still incorrect because "eat the most" is a comparative statement and doesn't make sense as a subject for the verb "wants.") A possible correction could be: "Since you eat the most, you seem to desire the least."
0	This sentence contains a double negative ("would want" and "wouldn't eat"), which creates confusion and negates the intended meaning of the sentence. A better way to express this idea would be using either a positive statement or a single negative statement. For example: "The less you eat, the more you would want." However, even this revised version could still benefit from some adjustment for clarity and naturalness, such as: "If you ate less, you might desire more." Therefore, I will provide the corrected sentence based on my last suggestion:	If you ate less, you might desire more.
0	The sentence contains a common error known as "misrelated phrases" because it incorrectly relates two clauses using "the more...the more" structure. In this case, the subject of the first clause ("John") does not match the implied subject of the second clause ("he"). Also, there's no need for "that".	The sentence should be corrected to say: "The more John eats, the more he pays."
0	This sentence needs a conjunction to connect the two clauses properly. Without it, there is no clear relationship between the actions of listening to music and getting depressed. The sentence implies that only one action occurs after another, but using "she" twice would be necessary for clarity without a coordinating conjunction such as "and".	Mary listens to the Grateful Dead **and** she gets depressed.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. There are no spelling errors, punctuation errors, or grammatical errors. Additionally, the sentence structure follows standard English syntax rules.	The angrier Mary got, the more she looked at pictures. Confidence level: I am a text-based AI model and my response has been written based on the information provided in the prompt. However, I don't have personal experiences or emotions, so my confidence level for this answer is high but not perfect.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "the higher his expectations," which is a noun clause acting as the direct object of the verb "are". The comparative adjective "higher" correctly modifies the noun "stakes", and the possessive pronoun "his" refers back to the subject of the sentence. There is no need for an article before "expectations" because it is part of a larger noun phrase headed by "expectations". Overall, the syntax and word choice are appropriate and clear.	The higher the stakes, the lower his expectations are.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It follows a common structure where two things are compared using the words 'the' and a comparative adjective ('more' or 'less'). In this case, the comparison is between how obnoxious Fred is and how much attention should be paid to him. As Fred becomes more obnoxious, it is suggested that less attention should be paid to him.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. Here, 'lots' acts as an adverb modifying the comparative form of the adjective 'obnoxious'. Together they convey a greater degree of comparison between 'John' and 'Fred', which is appropriate in context.	The sentence is already correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct because it follows standard subject-verb-object word order and uses proper verb tense agreement. Additionally, the meaning of the sentence can be understood easily without any ambiguity.	The sentence is already correct.
0	This sentence contains a common error known as "misrelated antecedents" because it incorrectly relates "the more" to both "Bill smokes" and "Susan hates him". A corrected version of this sentence would use "the more...the more..." construction correctly by relating each instance of "more" to its corresponding action.	The more Bill smokes, the more Susan hates it.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. There are no spelling errors, punctuation errors, or grammatical errors. Additionally, the word order follows standard English syntax rules.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject ("every senator") agrees with the verb ("seems"), and the pronoun ("he") has a clear antecedent ("senator"). Additionally, the word order follows standard English rules.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence contains a grammatical error known as a dangling modifier. The clause "because he likes" cannot correctly modify the subject of the main clause without specifying what John likes. A correct version would include a clear object for the verb "likes," such as "who John visits Sally because he likes her company."	Who does John visit Sally because he likes her company? (If we want to keep the same structure while fixing the mistake.) Otherwise, I suggest revising it completely to avoid confusion: For example, "John visits Sally because he enjoys spending time with her."
1	The sentence has a simple subject ("Marianne") and negative auxiliary verb ("did not") which correctly conveys the negative sense of the sentence. Also, there's no grammatical error found in this sentence. Therefore, it is grammatically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "He could not have been working" is grammatically correct. It is in the past perfect continuous tense, which describes an ongoing action that was interrupted and finished in the past. The subject "he" is followed by "could not have been," indicating uncertainty about a previous ongoing action. This is followed by the present participle "working," showing the continuing nature of the action before it was stopped.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence contains a double negative ("can not" and "not working"), which results in a positive statement when it should be negative. It would be grammatically correct to say either "He cannot have worked" or "He couldn't have been working," depending on context.	He could not have been working.
1	The sentence "You will believe Bob." is grammatically correct. It consists of a subject ("you"), an auxiliary verb ("will"), and a main verb ("believe") followed by its direct object ("Bob"). There are no spelling errors or awkward phrasings. Therefore, it can be understood easily and does not require any corrections.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "John has not kissed Mary" is grammatically correct. It follows the rules of subject-verb agreement and uses proper tense. Additionally, it includes appropriate punctuation and capitalization.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is correctly written in terms of grammar, punctuation, and spelling. It uses the past perfect tense ("had I seen") to express an action completed before another point in the past ("in my life"). This formulation emphasizes the speaker's strong impression about the uniqueness of Bangor. Therefore, there is no need for correction.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The pronoun 'it' is incorrect in this context because we need to know what object Mickey looked up. Without specifying the object of his gaze, the listener/reader will be confused about what he is looking at.	Mickey looked up the street. Confidence: 95%
0	The verb tense used in the sentence does not agree with the subject "there". A better way to construct the sentence would be using the present simple tense instead of the past simple tense since there's no indication of a completed action or habitual behavior.	The sentence should read as follows: "There tends to be a lot of discussion."
1	The sentence "John tried to be a good boy" is grammatically correct. There are no spelling errors, punctuation marks are used correctly, and the word order follows standard English syntax rules.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence ("John") is clearly identified, and the verb tense is consistent throughout the sentence. Additionally, there are no spelling errors or missing words.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and the subject ("we") and the verb ("want") agree in number. Also, the object of the sentence ("John") is clearly identified and there are no spelling errors.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "The box contained the ball from the tree" is grammatically correct. It has a clear subject ("the box"), verb ("contained"), and object ("the ball"). The prepositional phrase "from the tree" provides additional information about where the ball came from.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "escape" requires a subject, which refers to the entity that escapes. In this case, it seems like the intent is for "gas" to be the agent of escape, but this results in ungrammaticality because we don't say "the tube was escaped by gas". Instead, we would need to rephrase the sentence so that "gas" can function as the subject, such as "Gas caused the tube to escape".	Gas caused the tube to escape.
1	The sentence "Water bubbled up out of the kettle" is grammatically correct. There are no spelling errors, punctuation errors, or grammatical errors in the sentence. Additionally, the word choice and syntax are appropriate for standard English.	The sentence is already correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It contains a simple subject ("the tub") and a predicate verb ("leaked"), as well as a direct object ("water"). There are no grammatical errors such as misspelled words, incorrect verb tense, or misplaced punctuation marks.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "do" is unnecessary in this sentence because we can express the same idea without using it. We usually use "do" as a helper verb when there's a need to emphasize something or form questions or negations. Here, the meaning of the original sentence could be expressed more simply by saying, "The water filled the bottle."	The water filled the bottle.
0	The subject ("what") and verb ("was") in this sentence are mismatched in terms of tense and number. A more grammatically correct version would use a plural form for both the subject and the helping verb, as follows: "What the water did to the whole bottle were fill it." However, even after making this change, the sentence still sounds awkward due to the repetition of "the" before "whole bottle" and again before "it". It would be better rephrased as: "The water filled the entire bottle." Therefore, I will provide the corrected sentence below.	The water filled the entire bottle.
0	In this sentence, there is a mistake with the word "free". This word suggests that the leakage of the fluid did not cost anything, which doesn't make sense in this context. Instead, it seems that the intended meaning is to say that the fluid flowed freely from the tank without any restriction. To express this idea correctly, we need to use the adverbial form "freely" instead of the adjective "free".	The tank leaked the fluid freely.
0	The verb tense used in this sentence does not make sense for the intended meaning. Based on context clues, it seems as though the action of laying the ball in the box happened in the past; therefore, we need to use a past tense form of the verb. In present tense, the sentence would be fine ("John lays the ball in the box" implies that John has a habit of putting the ball into the box), but here I will assume that the speaker means to say that John put the ball into the box at some point in the past.	The sentence should read, "John laid the ball in the box."
1	The sentence "John owns the book" is grammatically correct. It contains a proper noun ("John"), a verb ("owns") in the third person present tense, and a definite article ("the") followed by a singular noun ("book"). The subject-verb agreement is also correct.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is correctly using the paired verb structure "persuade someone to do something" and each pair has a different subject ("Mary" and "Sue").	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It contains a subordinating conjunction ("although") to connect two clauses, one of which expresses a contrast between what most people think and what the courts found. Additionally, there is no ambiguity in meaning, and all punctuation marks are used appropriately.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence follows the standard structure of a simple sentence in English, which includes a subject ("Mary"), an adverb ("beautifully") modifying the verb, and the verb itself ("plays"). Additionally, the object of the verb appears as "the violin," making the overall construction grammatically sound.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence contains two errors related to verb tense agreement and word choice. Firstly, using "probably" implies uncertainty about a future event but combining it with "will" creates redundancy as "will" also indicates future tense. Secondly, learning something "perfectly" suggests mastery of all aspects which isn't typically possible even after immediate exposure. A more appropriate phrasing would be "Clearly, John will quickly pick up French," indicating certainty and feasibility.	Clearly, John will quickly grasp French.
0	In English, we usually say "Sue gave Bill a book," without using "to" before the indirect object. Using "to" in this way is common in some other languages, but it's incorrect in standard English.	Sue gave Bill a book.
1	The sentence "The men will all leave" is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple subject ("the men") and a verb in the future tense ("will leave"). There is no ambiguity in meaning, and the word choice is appropriate for standard English usage.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "John went home" is grammatically correct. It contains a proper noun ("John") as the subject, followed by a verb ("went") in past tense, which agrees with the subject's number and person. Finally, it ends with an adverbial phrase ("home").	The sentence is already correct.
0	The error in this sentence lies in the word "seriously" which does not fit grammatically into the structure of the sentence. It seems that it is being used incorrectly here as an adverb to modify the verb "represented". A better way to express what I think the writer intends would be: *	They vouched for Mary's credentials as a genuine linguist to the dean.
0	The verb "love" does not agree with its subject "us". In present tense, a plural subject requires a plural verb, so it should be "we love them", not "us love they". Also, the pronouns need to match in number; since "they" is plural, we need to use "them" instead of "you".	The sentence should be "We love them.", as both the subject-verb agreement and pronoun consistency have been corrected here.
1	The sentence "It is nice to go abroad" is grammatically correct. There are no spelling errors, punctuation errors, or grammatical errors in the sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Mary intended John to go abroad" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "Mary" is the subject of the sentence. It is a proper noun and refers to a specific person named Mary. * "intended" is the verb in the past tense. It indicates that some action occurred before another point in time. In this case, it shows that Mary had previously made plans for something to happen. * "John" is the direct object of the sentence. It follows the verb and receives the action of the verb. * "to go" forms an infinitive phrase acting as the complement of the verb "intend". Infinitives consist of "to" plus a base form of a verb, such as "to run," "to jump," or "to go." They can function as subjects, objects, or modifiers within a sentence. * "abroad" functions as an adverbial adjunct in the sentence because it describes where the action took place. Adverbs often end in "-ly," but they don't always have this suffix. Some common examples include "yesterday," "there," and "home."	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "I remembered having kissed Mary" is grammatically correct. It uses the past perfect tense ("had kissed") to indicate that the action of kissing happened before another past action, which is implied by the word "remembered". This tense construction is often used in narratives to sequence events.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence contains a comma splice error, which occurs when two independent clauses are incorrectly joined by only a comma. In this case, "I can't believe Fred won't" and "(either)" are both independent clauses and require proper punctuation to separate them.	I can't believe Fred won't; either. OR I can't believe Fred won't, for example. OR I can't believe Fred won't, nor do I understand why he wouldn't.
0	The second part of the conjunction ("and I also want to") lacks a noun or pronoun to complete the thought. It would be grammatically correct if rephrased as follows: "John wants to read Fred's story, and I also want to read it."	John wants to read Fred's story, and I also want to read it.
0	The sentence contains a grammatical error. In the second part of the sentence, it should be "whom" instead of "who," since "whom" is used as the object of the preposition "to."	We wanted to invite someone, but we couldn't decide whom to.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and makes sense semantically. Each of the two subjects has a verb and an object, which are connected by a coordinating conjunction ("and"). The use of possessive forms before the objects ("Fred's" and "Holly's") shows possession, indicating whose stories are being read.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence contains a subject-verb agreement error. In the clause "Holly shouldn't," the singular verb form "shouldn't" does not agree with its plural subject "Holly." Additionally, there lacks proper punctuation to separate the two clauses.	Mary claimed that eating cabbage, Holly shouldn't; or alternatively, "Mary claimed that Holly shouldn't eat cabbage."
0	The second half of the sentence "I also came to be" is incorrect because it lacks a specific object or complement to complete its meaning. It's unclear what the speaker "came to be". A more appropriate way to rephrase would be "I also came", which implies that the speaker arrived at the same place as Mary after being introduced by the bartender.	Mary came to be introduced by the bartender and I also came.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It uses the correct form of the modal verb "can" followed by the subject "I", and the first person singular present tense verb "will". The conjunction "and" connects two independent clauses.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence contains a common error related to subject-verb agreement. In the second part of the sentence, "Sally does too" implies that Sally also bothers her patrons, but the verb "does" doesn't agree with its singular subject "Sally". It would be grammatically correct if we were comparing two actions, such as "Joe eats pizza and Sally does too," where the plural form "do" agrees with the plural subjects "Joe eats" and "Sally does." However, in this case, the intended meaning seems to imply that Sally shares the same trait as Joe, so they should share the same verb.	The corrected version of the original sentence should read: "Joe's neuroses bother his patrons, and Sally's do too." This way, the verb "do" matches the plural noun "neuroses", which agrees with the plural subject "Sally's."
0	The issue with this sentence lies in the pronoun usage. In the second part of the sentence, "did it" is unclear because it could refer to either reading a book or not reading one. It would be better to explicitly state what action Lilly took, such as "and which book Lilly read for him instead."	I know which book José didn't read for class, and which book Lilly read for him instead.
0	The second part of the sentence "and this is the one which Fred won't do it" contains a grammatical error. Instead of "do it," we need to use a verb infinitive without "to" after "won't". Also, there is no clear antecedent for the pronoun "it", so we don't know what action or object Fred refuses to do.	The sentence can be corrected as follows: "This is the book which Bob reviewed, and this is the one which Fred won't review." Alternatively, if we want to keep the original meaning, we could say: "This is the book which Bob reviewed, and this is the one that Fred refuses to do."
0	The second part of the sentence after the comma should be a complete clause, but "which book Bob said that you hadn't" is missing a main verb. It seems that there might be some confusion about how to express the idea of one person saying something about what another person has not done regarding a book. A possible correction could be: "I know which book Mag read, and I also know which book Bob said you haven’t read yet."	I know which book Mag read, and I also know which book Bob said you haven’t read yet.
0	There is a misplaced modifier in the sentence. The clause "that you hadn't" is intended to modify "my report," but it is instead being applied to "Bob read." This results in confusion about who had not yet seen the report. To fix this error, we need to move "that you hadn't" closer to "my report."	I know which book Mag read, and which book Bob read before he saw my report that you hadn't.
1	The sentence follows the rules of subject-verb agreement, has a clear structure, and uses appropriate words for comparisons without any spelling or grammar errors. Therefore, it is grammatically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect due to a redundancy issue. The word 'did' is unnecessary because the auxiliary verb 'talked' has already been used. Moreover, using both 'about himself' and 'about him' is repetitive. We can simply say 'mention'. Here is the corrected version of the sentence:	Rusty talked about himself only after Mary mentioned him.
0	The second instance of "talk" should be "talked" to agree with the past tense of the first instance of "talk". Also, it's more grammatically consistent to use either "everything" or "something", but not both. Here's a corrected version: * Incorrect: "Fred talked about everything before Rusty did talk about something." * Corrected: "Fred talked about everything before Rusty talked about something." OR "Fred talked about things before Rusty did."	The sentence I provided as the corrected version is correct.
1	The sentence "John often meets Mary" is grammatically correct. It consists of a subject ("John"), an adverb ("often") modifying the verb, and a predicate ("meets Mary"). All elements agree in number and tense, making it a complete and coherent statement.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "perceive" needs to have a subject that can perform the action of perceiving. In this case, there is no clear subject present in the sentence. Additionally, it would be more appropriate to say "this problem is perceived easily" if we were trying to express that the problem is easy to perceive. However, without additional context, I cannot determine whether this is truly what the speaker intended to convey.	Either "This problem is easily perceived." or "One can easily perceive this problem."
1	The sentence "A hundred men surrounded the fort" is grammatically correct. Here, "a hundred" acts as a determiner for the noun "men," and it is followed by the verb "surrounded." This structure creates a simple sentence which expresses a complete thought, making it appropriate according to grammatical rules.	The sentence is already correct.
0	In English, we don't use the first person pronoun ("me") as the subject of a verb when referring to past actions involving a group. Instead, we would say "I was elected" or "They elected me". The formulation "we elected me" suggests that the speaker is both part of the electing body and its chosen member, which creates a logical contradiction.	They elected me.
0	The sentence contains a misplaced modifier, which makes it unclear what the subject of the question is referring to. The word "he" cannot refer clearly to anyone because there's no antecedent for it in the sentence. Therefore, the intended meaning of the sentence is ambiguous.	To which report did John admit that he was incompetent? Or, alternatively: Which report did John submit, stating his incompetence? These revised versions make clear who submitted the report and why they did so.
1	The sentence follows the grammatical rules of standard English and does not contain any spelling errors. It expresses a clear preference for lemons over limes using the comparative structure "prefer A to B".	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence is missing a verb after "which" to complete the clause. A possible correction could be "He let the cats which were whining out (something)," but without context it's hard to say what verb would fit best.	He let the cats that were whining outside.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct but it is missing context. We do not know who Bill is or what he bought. A complete sentence would include more information about the subject and the action. However, the grammar itself is correct.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence follows all of the necessary grammatical rules for standard English and there are no spelling errors.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The past participle form of the verb "give" should be used instead of the base form when referring to a completed action in the past. Additionally, there is a missing article before "John".	A proof that the claim had been given was provided by the fact that John had lied.
0	The sentence contains multiple errors in word order and preposition use. It is unclear what or who “he” attributed to the short circuit, making the sentence difficult to understand. Additionally, attributing something “to” a cause implies agency or intention on the part of the thing being attributed, so it does not make sense to attribute the fire to the short circuit here. Instead, we need to say that the short circuit caused the fire.	The fire that destroyed most of my factory was caused by a short circuit resulting from an overloaded transducer.
0	In this sentence, there is no explicit indication of who regards the proposal as absurd. It would be better to say something like "The mayor regarded the proposal to build a sidewalk from Dartmouth to Smith as absurd" so that it's clear who holds this opinion.	The mayor regarded the proposal to build a sidewalk from Dartmouth to Smith as absurd.
0	The sentence contains a common mistake known as a dangling modifier. In this case, "to remain a secret" is a present infinitive phrase acting as the direct object of the verb "left," but it's unclear who or what is supposed to remain a secret because the subject of the main clause ("Bill") has already performed the action of leaving. To fix this error, we need to specify whom or what Bill left to remain a secret. For example, we could say, "I want Bill to leave so that his whereabouts will remain a secret."	I want Bill to leave so that his whereabouts will remain a secret.
0	The sentence contains multiple errors. Specifically, there is a repeated word ("drives") and the preposition "as" is misused. It appears to be intended to indicate that the speaker knows someone named Tom who does the driving for some unspecified person or group of people, but it's written confusingly. A possible corrected version might read: "I know a man whom Tom drives," although this still leaves open the question of exactly how Tom is related to the man being driven. Alternatively, if the intended meaning is that the speaker knows a man who can drive well, one could say: "I know a man who, like Tom, is a skilled driver."	Based on my previous explanation, here are two options for a corrected sentence: * I know a man whom Tom drives. * I know a man who, like Tom, is a skilled driver.
0	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in this sentence. The plural form of the verb ("are") does not agree with its singular subject ("drowning cats," modified by the restrictive clause "which is against the law"). To fix this error, we need to change the verb from "are" to "is": "Drowning cat, which is against the law, is hard to rescue." However, even after making this correction, there would still be a problematic ambiguity regarding whether it's the act of drowning cats or just one particular drowning cat that is illegal. A clearer way to express this idea might be: "Rescuing drowning cats is difficult, especially since their drowning is illegal." This revised version avoids both grammatical errors and semantic ambiguities.	Rescuing drowning cats is difficult, especially since their drowning is illegal.
0	The sentence contains a redundancy error. The word "else" is unnecessary because the word "nothing" already conveys the idea of no additional information being provided.	Muriel said nothing that she had been insulted.
0	The subject ("Himself") and verb ("is understood") do not agree in number. In this case, "Himself" is a singular noun while "are" requires a plural noun. Additionally, it's more appropriate to say "Rutherford understands himself," as the passive voice can be confusing here.	The sentence is not correct. A possible correction would be: "Rutherford understands himself."
1	The sentence follows all of the necessary grammatical rules for standard American English. It has a clear subject ("I"), verb ("feel"), and object ("Arch"). Additionally, there are no spelling errors or awkward phrasings.	The sentence is already correct.
0	There is a grammatical error in the sentence. It should be "The proof of this set's recursiveness is difficult" or "It is difficult to prove that this set is recursive."	The proof of this set's recursiveness is difficult.
0	In this sentence, there is no clear indication of what the word "which" refers to - it could be referring to either "madrigals" or "the lute". This makes the sentence ambiguous and unclear. Additionally, a more grammatically correct way of phrasing the idea would be to say "Henry plays the lute and sings madrigals that sound lousy," rather than having "the lute" in the middle of the clause about singing.	Henry plays the lute and sings madrigals that sound lousy.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It consists of three independent clauses each with a subject ("Tom", "I", "Suzie") and a verb ("picked", "washed", "will prepare"). Each clause is separated by a comma followed by a conjunction, which is a grammatically correct way to connect independent clauses.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence is a question and therefore requires an question mark at the end instead of a period. Additionally, there should be a comma after "where" to separate two independent clauses.	"Where did you go, and who ate what?"
0	The sentence contains multiple errors related to subject-verb agreement, pronoun reference, and word order. Specifically, there is no clear subject for the verb "did," "boy's" should be "boys'," and it's unclear who "we" elected as "guardian's employer president." A possible interpretation of the intended meaning could be: "Which boy among the guards' employers did we elect as president?" However, even after making these corrections, the resulting sentence would still be quite awkward and convoluted.	It's difficult to determine a precise correction without knowing the intended meaning, but here's one possibility based on my previous interpretation: "Of all the boys who serve as guardians' employers, which one did we elect as president?"
0	The word "sane" requires a linking verb such as "is" to connect it to the subject of the sentence. In addition, there needs to be an article ("a", "an", or "the") before "Peter". Here's how the corrected sentence would look: "How sanely is Peter behaving?" / "How sane is the person named Peter?"	How sane is Peter? is incorrect. A possible correction could be: "How sanely does Peter behave?" or "How sane is the person called Peter?"
0	The sentence contains a minor error related to capitalization. In general, when referring to specific names of rivers, they should be capitalized. Therefore, it should be "the Hudson River" instead of "the hudson river".	I live at the place where Route 150 crosses the River and my dad lives at the place where Route 150 crosses the Hudson River too.
0	The pronoun 'it' in the second clause of the sentence refers to the same antecedent as the first clause ('the place'). However, in the second clause, 'it' is used instead of 'there'. This creates a grammatical error because 'it' cannot refer back to a location expressed by a prepositional phrase such as 'at the place'. Instead, one would say 'lives there too.'	I live at the place where Route 150 crosses the Hudson River and my dad lives there too.
0	The verb "to make up" requires an object in this context, as it means to reconcile with someone after a disagreement. Therefore, the question needs to specify who she is trying to reconcile with. A possible correction could be: "Who is she trying to make up to now?" or "Who is she trying to make up with now?"	Who is she trying to make up to now?
0	The past participle form of the verb 'get' should be used as an adjective to describe the noun. In this case, 'gotten' does not agree with its subject 'wind'. Also, there is no direct object for 'of', which makes the preposition unnecessary here. A more appropriate wording would have been 'Wind got hold of a plan to negotiate...'. However, it still doesn't sound natural; I recommend rephrasing the entire sentence to make it clearer and grammatically correct.	It became known that wind had got hold of a plan to negotiate an honorable end to the war in Vietnam.
0	The sentence is missing a preposition before "my friends". It should be "Mike talked about politics yesterday to his friends." or "Mike talked about politics to me yesterday.", depending on who the speaker is referring to as "my friends".	Mike talked about politics yesterday to his friends.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The passive voice structure ("was expected") is used appropriately, and there are no errors in subject-verb agreement, word choice, or punctuation.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The pronoun used to refer to the person wearing the hat should match their gender. In this case, the quote is attributed to "Mike," which suggests that Mike is a man. Therefore, it should be "he" instead of "she": "Which hat did Mike quip he never wore?" if Mike is a man, or "Which hat did Michelle quip she never wore?" if Mike is short for Michelle or another female name.	Which hat did Mike quip he never wore? (assuming Mike is a man), or Which hat did Michelle quip she never wore? (assuming Mike is short for Michelle or another female name).
0	The verb tense in the sentence is inconsistent. "Did quip" is in the past tense, but "never wore" should be in the past perfect tense to indicate a completed action before another past action. Also, there's a slight issue with the wording of the question itself. A better way to ask would be: "Which girl did Mike say had never worn this hat?"	Which girl did Mike say had never worn this hat?
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and understandable. There is a clear subject ("we"), verb ("donated"), and object ("wire"). Additionally, there is a prepositional phrase modifying another noun ("for the convicts to build cages with"). All of these elements form a complete thought.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The negation in the sentence "I won't have some money" is incorrect. Instead of using "won't," which implies a strong determination or refusal, we should use "don't" or "doesn't" to indicate simple negation. In addition, it would be more natural to say "any money" instead of "some money" when expressing a lack of something.	The corrected sentence is: "I don't have any money."
0	The sentence as it stands is grammatically incomplete and lacks context to determine its validity. It's unclear who the subject of the sentence is or what specific claim is being referred to. Therefore, I cannot definitively say whether the claim is true or false.	To provide a proper response, I would need additional information such as: "Do you believe the claim made by John that someone was looking for his missing wallet?" In this case, the sentence would be either true or false depending on whether or not that event occurred.
0	The sentence contains a minor error known as pronoun ambiguity. It is unclear whether "he" forced the speaker to give "her" money or if "he" attempted to force the speaker to give "him" money. This can be resolved by repeating the name of the person being referred to or using different pronouns for each individual.	I won't ask you to believe that John tried to force me to give her any money; instead, I will show you evidence that proves it.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "that," which is a pronoun referring to the idea expressed by "Sam sometimes didn't sleep." The verb "must have pleased" agrees with the singular subject "that," and the word "somebody" correctly follows the past participle form of the verb.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The pronoun "himself" is a reflexive pronoun, which refers back to the subject of the clause it appears in. In this case, the subject of the clause "I talked to Winston about himself" is "I", so using the reflexive pronoun "himself" does not make sense because it doesn't refer back to the subject. Instead, we should use the objective form of the pronoun, which would be "he". Therefore, the correct sentence is: "I talked to Winston about him."	I talked to Winston about him.
0	The first clause of the sentence contains several errors. Instead of saying "that the fuzz wanted him worried," it should say "that the fuzz worrying him" to be grammatically correct. Additionally, there should be a comma after "John" to separate the two independent clauses. Here is why: * In the original sentence, "wanted" suggests a past tense verb indicating completed action. However, "worried" implies an ongoing state rather than something that has been accomplished. Therefore, using the gerund form ("worrying") instead of the past participle ("worried") more accurately conveys the intended meaning. * Also, the lack of punctuation between the two clauses makes the sentence difficult to read and understand. Adding a comma clarifies where one thought ends and another begins.	That the fuzz were worrying him, but that they didn't want her worried, had always puzzled John and Mary.
0	The verb tense used in this sentence is incorrect. In this case, we need to use a present tense form of the verb "will" after "if", which is "will". So, instead of "will be working", it should be "works": "I'll work on it if Sam works on it."	The corrected sentence is: "I'll work on it if Sam works on it."
0	The verb tense is inconsistent within the sentence. It switches from past tense ("was") to present tense ("is"). Additionally, there is a missing article before "school bus."	The sentence should be "Yesterday, I saw a school bus was stopped."
0	The preposition "with" is incorrect here because it means equipped with or accompanied by. Instead of using "with", we need to use "to" because it indicates purpose and shows the relationship between the action and its recipient. Also, there is no comma after "Here's a knife". Commas are used to separate introductory elements, independent clauses, parenthetical expressions, lists, etc., but they are unnecessary when connecting two short related phrases such as “here’s” and “a knife.”	Here's a knife for you to cut up the onions.
0	The sentence contains a mistake in the use of double negatives. The word 'not' contradicts the meaning of 'which', making the intended meaning unclear. A better way to express this idea would be using 'but' instead of 'which not'. This creates a clear contrast between the fact that Fluffy is sick and others' lack of knowledge about it.	Fluffy is sick, but not everyone knows.
0	The sentence "Maxwell is quite a doctor" is grammatically incorrect because of the word "quite". In this context, it suggests that Maxwell is somewhat of a doctor or displays qualities associated with being a doctor, which does not make sense since one either is or isn't a medical professional. A more appropriate way to express admiration for someone's skills as a doctor would be to say "Maxwell is an excellent doctor" or "Maxwell is a very skilled doctor".	Maxwell is an excellent doctor.
0	There is a superfluous comma after "tall" which creates a comma splice error as it separates two independent clauses without proper punctuation such as a semicolon or period. Additionally, there is another unnecessary "and" before "the older one".	The younger woman might have been tall and the older one definitely was blond.
0	The sentence contains a punctuation error. There should be a semicolon instead of a comma before "Sheila" to separate the two independent clauses.	"Sally is tall, and may be blond; Sheila is short, and definitely is, blond."
0	The verb "try" should be followed by a base form of the verb, so it should be "I have to finish trying to grade..." instead of "I have to try to finish grading".	The sentence should read: "I have to try finishing grading some papers." Or better yet, "I need to finish grading some papers."
0	There is a repetition of the preposition "for" which makes the sentence ungrammatical. Additionally, the verb tense used does not make sense - something cannot be "planned" in the same way as one might plan an event. Instead, we would say that someone has planned something, or that they have made plans.	The socks are ready for you to put on; they've been carefully planned out.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and the word choice is appropriate for the context. There are no spelling errors and the structure of the sentence is clear and concise.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence contains a small error related to word choice. Although it's understandable, the more appropriate way to express it would be using 'it' instead of 'sonatas'. Here's why - when we say something is difficult to do X on Y, X usually refers to an action being performed upon Y. For example, "This violin is difficult to play (action) on" rather than specifying what kind of music, such as sonatas.	The sentence should be: "This violin is difficult to play on." Alternatively, if you want to specify the type of piece, consider saying "Playing sonatas on this violin is challenging," which conveys the same meaning without grammatical errors.
0	The sentence is a run-on sentence because it incorrectly joins two independent clauses ("my mother is easy to please" and "[I] please my father") without appropriate punctuation or conjunction. Additionally, there seems to be a missing word after "father."	Either "My mother is easy to please, and she also pleases my father," or "My mother, who is easy to please, also pleases my father."
0	The sentence contains a punctuation error which can lead to confusion about who did not have an umbrella - Poor Bill or someone else being referred to as 'he'. Also, there's no need for a comma after 'Poor Bill' since they aren't two separate clauses but one complete thought.	"Label: 0 Explanation: The sentence contains a punctuation error which can lead to confusion about who did not have an umbrella - Poor Bill or someone else being referred to as 'he'. Also, there's no need for a comma after 'Poor Bill' since they aren't two separate clauses but one complete thought. Poor Bill had started to rain and he had no umbrella."
0	The second sentence, "that robbery," is a fragment sentence and lacks a subject and verb. Additionally, there is no clear connection between the first sentence and the second one.	The sentence could be revised as follows: "It's terrible that the cops spoke to the janitor about the robbery yesterday." This version includes a complete sentence that makes sense on its own and clarifies the relationship between the two clauses.
0	The pronoun "he" lacks clarity as to whom it refers; there has been no prior mention of a specific male student. Also, the term "a swinger" may be misunderstood by some readers due to its colloquial connotations. It would be better to use a more formal expression such as "an active participant."	Every student who wears socks is an active participant.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and has a clear subject ("that girl"), verb ("was given"), and object ("my binoculars"). The sentence also includes proper use of punctuation and capitalization.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and makes sense semantically. There are no spelling errors and the word order follows standard English syntax rules.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It uses the correct form of the subjunctive mood ("should" + bare infinitive verb "work") after the word "who", which indicates a hypothetical situation. Additionally, the subject-verb agreement is correct, as the plural noun "anything" requires the singular verb "hates".	The sentence is already correct.
0	The pronoun "his" in this context can be misleading because it assumes all people who talk in their sleep after buying something on credit are male. A more inclusive way to word this would be to replace "his" with "their," which does not assume a specific gender for those who buy things on credit and talk in their sleep.	Everybody around here who ever buys anything on credit talks in their sleep.
0	The sentence contains a pronoun ambiguity error. It is unclear whether "somebody" refers to one person or multiple people. Also, the word "misgivings," which means doubts or fears about something, does not fit grammatically in this context as it cannot be attributed to a specific person. Instead, consider using the noun form of the verb "remember" such as "recollection" or "memory".	I can't recall the name of the person who expressed concerns.
0	The sentence contains a grammatical error. The subject of the sentence is plural ("No writers" and "no playwrights"), so the verb should also be plural. However, the verb used here is singular ("meets").	No writer and no playwright meet in Vienna.
0	The sentence contains a grammatical error. The subject of the sentence is plural ("No writers" and "nor any playwrights"), but the verb is singular ("meets"). This mismatch creates a grammatical inconsistency.	Either "No writer meets in Vienna," or "No writers meet in Vienna" would be grammatically correct. Similarly, "Nor does any playwright meet in Vienna" could also be used to maintain parallelism between the two clauses.
0	The sentence contains a double negative which creates confusion about the intended meaning. The word "not" negates "is certain," but "any" also has a negative connotation. It would be better to say "It is uncertain whether you will marry any student."	It is uncertain whether you will marry any student.
1	The sentence "Felicia kicked the ball off the bench" is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("Felicia"), a verb ("kicked") and an object ("the ball"). The prepositional phrase "off the bench" functions as an adverbial of place, modifying the verb to indicate where the action took place. There are no spelling errors, punctuation errors, or other grammatical issues.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "I sent the package halfway around the world" is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple sentence structure with a subject ("I"), an auxiliary verb ("sent") and an object ("the package"). Additionally, the adverbial phrase "halfway around the world" provides more information about where the package was sent.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The word 'out' does not need to be included in the sentence because it creates redundancy as 'from the basket' also indicates the direction of giving the ball.	The sentence should be: "Sam gave the ball from the basket."
1	The sentence "Sam offered the ball out of the basket" is grammatically correct. Here, 'offered' is a verb in past tense which indicates an action performed by 'Sam', 'the ball' is a direct object which received the action from sam, and 'out of the basket' is a prepositional phrase describing where the action took place. Therefore, there is no need to change anything in this sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Park Square has a festive air" is grammatically correct. There are no spelling errors, punctuation errors, subject-verb agreement issues, or other common grammatical mistakes.	The sentence is already correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct and follows standard English syntax rules. It consists of a simple subject ("the worker") and a predicate verb ("will have"), along with the object complement ("a job"). There are no grammatical errors or awkward constructions to indicate incorrectness.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence contains a pronoun error. It should be "you all" instead of just "you", since there is an implied plural subject being referred to ("no one"). This is necessary for parallel structure and grammatical agreement between the subject and verb.	No one can forgive that comment to you all.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and uses appropriate punctuation marks. Additionally, the verb tense is consistent throughout the sentence, making it easy to understand the sequence of events.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It contains a independent clause ("Sarah promised Catherine her old car") and another independent clause joined by the conjunction "but" ("but then gave it to her son instead"). Each clause has a subject and verb, so they can stand alone as complete thoughts. There are no grammatical errors such as incorrect word order, missing punctuation marks, misspelled words, etc.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb tense used in this sentence is incorrect. The past participle form of a verb should be used after "have" or "has," while the simple past tense should be used after phrases such as "I lent." Therefore, "lent" should be changed to "loaned" or "gave" for grammatical accuracy.	I loaned the book partway to Tony. OR I gave the book partway to Tony.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple sentence structure where the subject ("the farmer") performs the action ("loaded") on the direct object ("the cart"). Additionally, there is a prepositional phrase ("with apples") which modifies how the loading occurred. There are no grammatical errors present.	The sentence is already correct.
0	In this context, "dumped" implies carelessness or disregard for where the cart ended up. It would be unusual to treat a full cart of valuable produce in such a manner. A more likely scenario might involve unloading or emptying the cart instead.	The farmer unloaded the cart with apples.
0	The verb "carved" does not agree with its subject "Martha". Since Martha is singular, the verb should also be singular, i.e., "carved" should be changed to "carves". Additionally, it's generally considered inappropriate to refer to babies as "the baby", so I would recommend changing "the baby" to just "baby".	Martha carves the toy out of wood for her baby.
1	In the present tense, verbs do not change based on the subject of the sentence, so "cuts" is grammatically correct here as the verb for the singular subject "bread."	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "broke" does not make sense in this context when used with the preposition "on". Additionally, it is not possible to break a person's finger in this manner. A more appropriate way to phrase this sentence would be "Janet accidentally broke Bill's finger."	Janet broke Bill's finger.
1	The sentence "Janet broke the cup" is grammatically correct. It consists of a proper subject ("Janet") and a verb ("broke"), followed by a direct object ("the cup"). There are no spelling errors or awkward phrasings.	The sentence is already correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct because it contains a subject ("the visitor"), an action verb ("rang") in the past tense, and an object ("the bell"). The word order follows standard English syntax rules.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence "We pulled free" is grammatically incomplete and lacks context to be fully understood. It's unclear what action is being performed or who or what is being freed. A complete sentence requires a subject, verb, and object or predicate that expresses a complete thought.	The sentence needs more information to be corrected. An example of a possible correction could be: "After struggling for hours, we finally managed to pull ourselves free from the mud."
1	The sentence "That movie always shocks people" is grammatically correct. It consists of a subject ("that movie"), an auxiliary verb ("always"), and an object ("people"). There are no spelling errors or punctuation issues.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "That movie always shocks" is grammatically correct. It consists of a subordinating conjunction ("that"), a noun ("movie"), and a verb ("shocks") in its present tense third-person singular form. There's no need for any auxiliary verbs to indicate continuous aspect because it implies a habitual action rather than a momentary one.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The subject of a sentence must always be followed by a verb. In this case, the subject "Sharon" is present but there is no verb directly after it. A correct version of this sentence would include a form of the verb "to be," such as "is" or "was."	Corrected: Sharon came into the room. Alternatively, the original sentence could also be corrected to read "Sharon is in the room," depending on context and intended meaning.
1	The sentence "Bill sent a package to Tom" is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("Bill"), a verb ("sent") and an object ("a package"). Additionally, it includes the preposition "to" followed by its object "Tom", indicating the recipient of the package. All elements are correctly used which makes the sentence grammatically sound.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "That acorn will grow into an oak tree" is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("that acorn"), a verb tense that indicates future action ("will grow"), and a complement ("an oak tree"). There are no spelling errors, punctuation errors, or awkward phrasing in the sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "He turned into a frog" is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("he"), a verb ("turned") and an object ("a frog"). The tense of the verb correctly indicates a past action.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and makes sense semantically. There are no spelling errors, punctuation marks are used correctly, and subject-verb agreement is observed. Moreover, word order follows standard English syntax rules.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence "Brian threw the fence with the stick" is grammatically incorrect because it uses the preposition 'with' to indicate the means by which something is thrown. However, fences cannot be thrown. Moreover, if we were to disregard this issue and assume that the sentence refers to throwing an object at a fence, the use of 'the' before 'stick' implies that there is only one stick being used, so using 'with' would still be incorrect. Instead, we could say "Brian threw the stick at the fence," or "Brian used the stick to throw something over the fence."	Brian threw the stick at the fence.
1	The sentence "Mira condemned Terry for the accident" is grammatically correct. There are no spelling errors, punctuation errors, or grammatical errors in the sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "We investigated the area for bombs" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "we," which is a plural noun referring to the speaker and possibly others as well. The verb "investigated" agrees with the plural subject because it ends in "-ed" to indicate past tense. The preposition "for" introduces the prepositional phrase "for bombs," which functions as an adverbial modifier specifying what the investigating was done for. Overall, the syntax and word choice are appropriate for standard English usage.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "I sensed his eagerness" is grammatically correct as it follows the standard structure of a simple sentence, consisting of a subject ("I"), an auxiliary verb ("sensed") and an object ("his eagerness"). Additionally, all words are spelled correctly, and there are no punctuation errors.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "They praised the dedication in the volunteers" is grammatically correct. Here, "dedication" is a noun being modified by the prepositional phrase "in the volunteers," indicating where the dedication can be found. It's clear from the context that it refers to the dedication shown by the volunteers themselves.	The sentence is already correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("the earth"), a linking verb ("was"), and a predicate adjective ("believed to be round"). The word order is also correct, following standard English syntax rules.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Sarah smiled a charming smile" is grammatically correct. There are no spelling errors, punctuation errors, or grammatical errors.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Sandra beamed a cheerful welcome" is grammatically correct. Here, 'beamed' is used as a verb which means to emit light or warmth, typically continuously and without control. It can also mean to express something such as happiness by smiling broadly. A 'cheerful welcome' is a noun phrase here acting as the direct object of the sentence taking the reception of the action expressed by the verb. Therefore, there are no grammatical errors in the sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "You've really lived it up" is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("you"), a helping verb ("have") and a past participle form of the phrasal verb "live it up," which means to enjoy oneself thoroughly, especially by indulging in luxury or extravagance. The contraction "you've" is also correctly used here as the second person singular present perfect tense of the verb "to have".	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "lift" requires a direct object to indicate who or what is being lifted. In this case, it seems that the subject of the sentence ("paperback books") is intended to be the one doing the lifting, which would require the use of a reflexive pronoun such as "themselves". Therefore, the correct form of the sentence should be "Paperback books lift themselves onto the table easily."	Paperback books lift themselves onto the table easily.
0	In present tense verbs, we use 'lift' when something is being raised up from a lower position to a higher one. However, if we want to indicate that the action of lifting has been completed, we need to add 'have' or 'has'. Therefore, the verb 'lifted' requires a helping verb such as 'have', 'has' or 'had' for grammatical correctness.	The books have been lifted onto the table.
1	The sentence "Jessica loaded boxes under the wagon" is grammatically correct. However, it could be more specific about where exactly Jessica loaded the boxes - for example, "Jessica loaded boxes underneath the wagon". But as it stands, the sentence is still technically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Jessica loaded boxes on the wagon" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Jessica," a proper noun used as the subject of the verb "loaded." The direct object of the sentence is "boxes," which receives the action of the verb. Finally, "on the wagon" describes where the action took place, serving as an adverbial prepositional phrase.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence is missing a determiner before the word "truck". In English, we usually need to include an article ("a", "an", or "the") or another type of determiner ("my", "your", etc.) before a noun. Without it, the sentence sounds incomplete and unnatural.	Jessica crammed boxes at the moving truck.
0	The verb 'butter' requires a direct object to complete its meaning. In this case, the direct object of the sentence should be 'the toast'. However, there is a preposition 'at' which does not belong here. A corrected version would simply have 'Lora buttered the toast.'	Lora buttered the toast.
1	The sentence "Carla shoveled the walk" is grammatically correct. It consists of a proper subject-verb agreement ("Carla," being singular, matches with the past tense verb "shoveled"). Additionally, the article "the" correctly precedes "walk," which functions as a noun in this case. No grammatical errors were found within this sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Nora sent the book" is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple sentence with a subject ("Nora"), an auxiliary verb ("did"), and an object ("the book"). There are no spelling errors, punctuation errors, or grammatical errors.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Nora sent Peter the book" is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple sentence structure: subject ("Nora") + verb ("sent") + indirect object ("Peter") + direct object ("the book"). All elements are present and used correctly. There are no spelling errors, punctuation errors, or grammatical mistakes such as incorrect agreement between subjects and verbs, wrong use of tenses, etc.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Carla slid the book" is grammatically correct. It consists of a proper subject ("Carla"), verb ("slid") and object ("the book"). There are no grammatical errors such as incorrect word usage, agreement issues between subject and verb, tense inconsistency, etc. Therefore, it's a well-structured sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "slid" indicates past tense movement of a subject along a surface. This action requires a preposition such as "on," "over," or "under" followed by the object being moved across. In this case, we would expect to see something like "Carla slid on the floor" or "Carla slid under the table." Here, there seems to be no clear connection between the action taken by the subject ("Carla") and the object affected by that action ("the book"). Thus, it's unclear what exactly happened to the book.	Carla slid at the book implies she stopped right next to it. However, if her intention was to slide over or beside it, consider rephrasing for clarity. For example, "Carla stopped at the book" or "Carla slid the book across the table."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and makes sense in context. There is a clear subject ("Amanda"), verb ("carried"), and object ("the package"). Additionally, there is a prepositional phrase ("to Pamela") indicating where the action took place.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The subject of the sentence ("Packages") is plural, but the verb ("drive") does not agree with it in number. In addition, packages cannot drive themselves; only people can drive. Therefore, the sentence is grammatically incorrect.	Trucks carrying packages drive easily to New York. Alternatively, if we want to say that packages can be delivered to New York without difficulty, a better way to express it would be: "It's easy for packages to be sent to New York" or "Deliveries to New York are straightforward".
1	The sentence "The chair pushed" is grammatically correct but its meaning is unclear without additional context. It could mean that someone pushed a chair, or it could mean that a chair moved on its own. However, since I am only evaluating the grammaticality of the sentence and not its clarity or appropriateness in a particular context, I will label it as grammatically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "We offered a job to her" is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple sentence structure with the subject ("we") followed by the verb ("offered") and the object ("a job"). The indirect object ("to her") is correctly introduced with the preposition "to". There are no grammatical errors in terms of tense, agreement, word choice, or punctuation.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence is missing a subject and a verb to form a complete thought. This makes it a sentence fragment rather than a full sentence.	A company has offered a job.
1	The sentence "Brown presented a plaque to Jones" is grammatically correct. It contains a simple subject ("Brown"), a verb ("presented"), and an object ("a plaque"). The indirect object of the sentence is "Jones," who received the direct object "plaque." There are no grammatical errors in this sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Carmen bought Mary a dress" is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple sentence with a subject ("Carmen"), an auxiliary verb ("bought"), and an object ("a dress"). Additionally, it follows standard English word order (SVO), making it easy to understand.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Carmen obtained the spare part at the hardware store" is grammatically correct. There are no spelling errors, punctuation errors, or grammatical errors in the sentence. All of the words are used correctly in their proper context, and the syntax is well-formed. Therefore, I would rate this sentence as being grammatically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence ("Michelle") is doing the action ("kept"), which is indicated by the verb. The direct object of the sentence ("the desk") receives the action. There are no grammatical errors in this sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Frances hid the presents in the drawer" is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("Frances"), a verb ("hid") in past tense, and an object ("the presents"). The prepositional phrase "in the drawer" provides additional information about where the action took place. All of these elements come together to form a complete thought, making it a proper sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct and makes sense in context. The subject ("the needle") is performing the action denoted by the verb ("poked"), and the object of the sentence ("the cloth") receives the action.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Carrie touched that cat" is grammatically correct. It consists of a noun phrase ("Carrie"), a verb ("touched") and another noun phrase ("that cat"). All elements agree with each other in number and tense, making it a well-formed sentence in English.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Herman whipped the sugar and the cream" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Herman," and the verb is "whipped." The direct objects of the verb are "the sugar" and "the cream," which are both correctly modified by the definite article "the." There are no grammatical errors in this sentence, so it receives a score of 1.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Linda taped the picture to the wall" is grammatically correct. It has a clear subject ("Linda"), verb ("taped"), and object ("the picture"). The preposition "to" indicates the direction of taping, followed by its destination ("the wall"). There's no need for any changes as all elements work well together within proper syntax rules.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Linda taped the picture onto the wall" is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple sentence with a subject ("Linda"), verb ("taped") and object ("the picture"). The preposition "onto" followed by its object "the wall" describes where the action took place. All words are spelled correctly and there is no missing punctuation marks. Therefore, it does not require any corrections.	The sentence is already correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It uses the past tense of the verb "to cling," which agrees with its subject, "the child and her mother." Additionally, it employs proper word order for a simple sentence (subject + verb + object), making it clear and easy to understand.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "This flyer and that flyer differ" is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("this flyer and that flyer") and a verb ("differ"), which agrees with the subject in number. There are no obvious spelling errors, punctuation issues, or incorrect word usage.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The word "apart" should be replaced with "in" to correctly form a comparison between the two flyers. The preposition "from" could also work here, but "in" implies differences in content rather than physical separation.	This flyer and that flyer differ in something.
0	In this sentence, there is a misuse of the word 'scribbled'. Scribbling implies writing something carelessly or hastily, often illegibly. Here, it doesn't make sense for someone to sign their name carelessly on a contract since legibility is important. Instead, they would carefully print or sign their name.	The jeweler signed the contract with his name.
0	This sentence contains a mistake related to the process of growth for plants. An acorn does not grow into an oak tree; instead, it germinates and develops into an oak sapling, which eventually becomes an oak tree as it grows larger over time. Therefore, the verb used here should be "germinated" rather than "grew".	The gardener helped that acorn germinate into an oak tree.
1	The sentence "I shaped a loaf" is grammatically correct. It consists of a subject ("I"), a verb ("shaped") in past tense, and an object ("a loaf"). All words are spelled correctly and used appropriately in context. There is no need for any corrections to be made.	The sentence is already correct.
0	This sentence is missing a direct object, which is necessary for the verb "amuse" to make sense. Without an object, it's unclear who or what the children found amusing. In other words, we don't know what they were doing to cause amusement. A complete sentence might be: "The children amused us with their silly antics."	The sentence should be: "The children amused us." if the intended meaning is that the children caused amusement for others, such as themselves or a group of people. Alternatively, if no specific object is meant, a more general sentence could be: "The children were amusing," indicating that they did something entertaining or funny without specifying exactly what it was.
1	The sentence "Susan whispered the news" is grammatically correct. It consists of a proper noun ("Susan") as the subject, followed by the past tense verb form "whispered", which agrees with the singular subject. Finally, we have the object of the sentence, "the news". There are no grammatical errors in this sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Susan whispered at Rachel" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Susan," and she is performing the action of whispering. The preposition "at" indicates the direction of her whisper to Rachel.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Ellen said that melons were selling well" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Ellen," which is a proper noun and correctly capitalized. The verb "said" indicates past tense, which agrees with the time frame established by using "Ellen" instead of present tense "say". Additionally, there's a subordinating conjunction "that", followed by another clause "melons were selling well". Here, "melons" is a plural noun functioning as the subject and "were selling" is its corresponding predicate, indicating passive voice. Overall, all elements within the sentence work together to create a coherent thought, making it grammatical.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence is missing a noun after "about" to make it grammatically complete. In this context, I assume "present conditions" refers to some unspecified situation being discussed by Ellen. However, without a specific direct object of the preposition "about," the sentence remains incomplete.	Ellen said something about the present conditions. Here's why the corrected version works better than the original: - Added "something": This provides a clearer meaning for what Ellen said, even if we don't know exactly what she mentioned. It now functions as the direct object of the verb 'said'. - Included a definite article before 'conditions': Since no further specification has been provided regarding these conditions, using the definite article clarifies that they refer to some known state rather than any possible condition.
1	The sentence follows all of the necessary grammatical rules for standard English, so it is a grammatically correct sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Cynthia nibbled on the carrot" is grammatically correct. It consists of a proper subject ("Cynthia") and predicate ("nibbled on the carrot"). Additionally, there are no spelling errors, punctuation issues, or incorrect word usage. Therefore, it meets all the requirements for a grammatically correct sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Cynthia chewed" is grammatically correct. It consists of a proper noun ("Cynthia") acting as the subject and a verb ("chewed"). Since there are no errors to be found within the structure or syntax of the sentence, it can be concluded that the statement is indeed grammatically sound.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence follows standard English grammar rules and has a clear subject ("Paul") and verb ("laughed"). There are no spelling errors or awkward phrasings.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The error in this sentence lies in the object of the verb "wink". In standard English, we do not wink our lips; rather, we wink our eye(s). This action involves closing one's eyelid quickly as a signal to others. Winking one's lip does not have any commonly accepted meaning in English.	The sentence should be corrected as follows: "Linda winked her eye." Alternatively, if the intended meaning is to convey a gesture involving pursing one's lips, it could be expressed differently using appropriate language, such as "Linda pursed her lips suggestively" or "Linda gave a sly smile by quirking her lips."
0	The verb "pound" requires a direct object to complete its meaning, but in this case, there is no clear direct object for "pound." A more appropriate way to express this idea would be "My heart is pounding loudly" or "My heart is pounding in my chest," where "loudly" and "in my chest" serve as the direct objects of the verb "pounding."	My heart is pounding loudly.
1	The sentence "Sharon fainted from hunger" is grammatically correct. Here, "fainted" is the past tense of the verb "faint," which means to lose consciousness suddenly due to a lack of blood flow to the brain. This sentence correctly uses the past tense to describe a completed action, and there are no grammatical errors such as subject-verb agreement violations, incorrect word usage, or punctuation issues.	The sentence is already correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure of an English sentence, where "the witch" is the subject, "poisoned" is the verb, and "the children" is the object. Additionally, each word is spelled correctly and uses appropriate punctuation.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "A grandfather clock ticked in the hallway" is grammatically correct. There are no spelling errors, punctuation errors, or grammatical errors in the sentence. Additionally, the word order follows standard English syntax rules.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb “squeak” is an intransitive verb, which means it cannot take a direct object. In the sentence provided, “the door” is being used as a direct object of the verb “squeak,” but this is incorrect because the door is actually the source of the sound made by squeezing something else against it, such as a key or one’s hand. A correct version of the sentence might be “I squeezed the handle, making the door squeak.”	I squeezed the handle, making the door squeak.
1	The sentence "Over the fire there bubbled a fragrant stew" is grammatically correct. There are no spelling errors, punctuation errors, subject-verb agreement issues, or other common grammatical mistakes.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and conveys a clear meaning. It follows standard English syntax rules and uses appropriate vocabulary and tense. There are no spelling errors or awkward phrasings.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The word "fort" does not fit well in this context because a fort is typically associated with being a solid structure rather than something that can have things fluttering on it. A more appropriate word to use would be "castle," "building," or another noun that implies some sort of structure where flags could be placed and seen as fluttering.	The castle fluttered with many flags.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple subject ("the voices") and a verb in the past tense ("echoed"), followed by the prepositional phrase "in the hall" indicating where the action took place. All elements are used correctly and there is no spelling error.	The sentence is already correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct and conveys a clear meaning. The subject of the sentence ("the stream") is acting as the verb ("twists"), which shows action being performed by the subject. Additionally, there is a prepositional phrase ("through the valley") that modifies the verb by describing where the action takes place. All of these elements work together to create a well-formed and complete sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb tense used in this sentence does not agree with the intended meaning. "There presented" is past participle form which requires a helping verb such as "was" to make sense grammatically. Moreover, it would be more appropriate to say "an opportunity presented itself" rather than "there presented itself".	A wonderful opportunity presented itself yesterday.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and follows proper syntax rules for a simple sentence. It contains a subject ("a wonderful opportunity"), an adjective modifying the subject ("wonderful"), and a verb in past tense form ("presented"). Additionally, there is a temporal prepositional phrase providing context for when the event occurred ("to him yesterday").	The sentence is already correct.
0	In present tense, we use "jumps" instead of "jumped". The word "out" should come before "of", so the correct form would be "A little white rabbit jumped out of the box."	A little white rabbit jumps out of the box.
1	The sentence "Penny skated around the rink" is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("Penny"), a verb ("skated") in past tense, and an adverbial of place ("around the rink"). All the words are spelled correctly and used appropriately for their part of speech. Moreover, there's no punctuation error in it.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Jackie accompanied Rose" is grammatically correct. It consists of a proper noun ("Jackie") as the subject, followed by a verb ("accompanied"), and another proper noun ("Rose") as the object. Both subjects and verbs agree in number, making it a well-formed simple sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in this sentence. In the singular form, "information" takes a singular verb, so it should be "much information was provided," but in its plural form ("informations"), it would take a plural verb ("were provided"). However, since we usually use "information" as an uncountable mass noun in English, using it in the plural form is quite unusual.	Much information was provided.
0	The word "advice" is uncountable, so it should be used with a singular verb. Therefore, "offers many advices" is incorrect.	The sentence should read "John offers much advice."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("the cake that Jones got") and a predicate ("was more delicious than the one that Smith got"). Additionally, it utilizes proper verb tense agreement and demonstrates appropriate use of comparative language to compare two distinct cakes.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "eat" requires a base form of the verb after it, so instead of "less cake," we need to say "less cake AND fewer pastries" because countable nouns such as "pastries" require the word "fewer." Also, there should be a comma before the conjunction "and" if two independent clauses follow each other.	We recommend eating less cake and fewer pastries.
1	The sentence "I saw that gas can explode" is grammatically correct. Here, "gas" is acting as an adjective to describe the type of can, so a determiner such as "a" or "the" is not necessary before it. Additionally, there is no punctuation error or tense inconsistency in the sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "He washed her" is grammatically correct. It consists of a subject ("he"), a verb ("washed") in the past tense, and an object ("her"). All elements have clear referents, so there's no ambiguity about who did what to whom.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "wash" requires an object to complete its meaning. In this case, it's unclear who or what is being washed. Additionally, the pronoun "you" should be preceded by a proper noun or a determiner such as "he," "she," "it," "these," etc.	The correct sentence could be either "Wash yourself!" if addressing the person being washed, or "Wash him!" / "Wash her!" / "Wash them!" depending on whom you want to wash.
0	The sentence is missing a direct object after the verb "have." In this context, it seems like the speaker is trying to say that someone does not possess something, so a possible correction would be to add a noun or pronoun as the direct object.	The sentence should be "They have nothing" if the intended meaning is that they do not possess anything.
0	The subject of the sentence, "Some," requires a plural verb to agree with it. In this case, "some" functions as a determiner for the noun "jobs", which is plural. Therefore, the verb "are" should be used instead of "is".	Some of my jobs are in jeopardy.
0	The verb tense does not agree with the subject of the sentence. In the present perfect tense, which is used for actions completed at an unspecified time before now, we use "has" or "have" plus the past participle form of the main verb. Here, the past simple form ("met") is incorrect because it implies a specific time frame, while "last night" indicates that the action occurred in the past. A better choice would be to use the past simple tense throughout the sentence, as follows:	The sentence should read: "It was the policeman who met several young students in the park last night," where "who" functions as a relative pronoun connecting two clauses together, and "was" agrees with the singular noun "policeman".
0	The verb tense used in the sentence is incorrect. "Did" is a past-tense auxiliary verb that requires the main verb to be in its base form, but "meet" is already in its base form. Therefore, using "did" creates a mismatch between the tenses of the two verbs. A better way to ask the question would be "Did the policeman meet you in the park?" or "Does the policeman meet you in the park?" depending on whether the speaker wants to know about a past event or a regular occurrence.	Did the policeman meet you in the park?
1	The sentence "John put old books in the box" is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("John"), a verb ("put") in past tense, and an object ("old books"). The prepositional phrase "in the box" adds more information to the sentence without interrupting its grammatical structure.	The sentence is already correct.
0	This sentence is missing a verb. A proper sentence needs both a subject ("the monkeys") and a predicate (a verb along with any accompanying objects or modifiers), but here we only have a noun phrase without a corresponding verb to form a complete thought. In order for the sentence to be grammatically correct, it would need to include a verb such as "are" after "monkeys," so the corrected version would read "The monkeys are proud of their leader."	The sentence should be "The monkeys are proud of their leader."
0	The sentence is missing a descriptive word after "very". Without it, the sentence is grammatically incorrect because there is no complete thought being expressed.	John sounded very tired.
0	The sentence is a fragment because it lacks a main verb. A complete sentence requires both a subject and a predicate. In this case, "I" is the subject but there is no main verb for the subject to perform. Adding a suitable verb such as "should" before "agree" would make the sentence grammatically correct.	I don't know if I should agree or not.
1	The sentence "John bought a book on the table" is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("John"), a verb ("bought") and an object ("a book"). Additionally, it includes a prepositional phrase ("on the table") which describes where the action took place. All of these elements come together to form a complete sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "John called the president a fool" is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple sentence with a subject ("John"), a verb ("called"), and an object ("the president"). The addition of the adjective "a fool" correctly describes the direct object of the sentence. There are no grammatical errors present in this sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and conveys a clear meaning. There are no errors in subject-verb agreement, word usage, tense, or punctuation.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and makes sense in context. There are no spelling errors or punctuation issues.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb tense used in this sentence is incorrect. In English, when we want to say that someone continually does something for us, we use the present perfect tense, which requires has/have been followed by a past participle. Here, the word 'remained' is the past participle form of the verb 'to remain', but since the action is still happening now, it needs to be in the present perfect tense. Therefore, a more appropriate way to express this idea would be: “A good friend remains to me by him” (though note that even this revised version sounds awkward; see below for further correction.)	The sentence should read as follows: "He continues to be a good friend to me," or simply, "He is a good friend to me" if referring to his current state rather than ongoing actions.
0	The verb "eat" requires a plural noun as its direct object when we consider standard American English usage. The singular form of the noun here ("noodle") instead of the expected plural form ("noodles") results in a grammatically incorrect sentence.	John ate his noodles quietly.
1	The sentence "A smith hammered the metal" is grammatically correct. It has a clear subject ("a smith"), verb ("hammered") and object ("the metal"). There are no spelling errors, punctuation marks are used correctly, and there is nothing else to suggest that it might be incorrect.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Sandy removed her ballet shoes" is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("Sandy"), a verb ("removed") and an object ("her ballet shoes"). There are no spelling errors, and the word order follows standard English syntax rules.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is correctly written in terms of grammar, spelling, punctuation, and word choice. It follows standard English conventions and conveys a clear meaning.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and the punctuation is appropriate. There are no spelling errors or awkward phrasings.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Everyone hoped that she would sing" follows standard English grammar rules and does not contain any spelling errors. Therefore, it is grammatically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "This proved a decisive factor" is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("this"), a verb tense that indicates past action ("proved"), and an object complement ("a decisive factor"). There are no spelling errors, punctuation errors, or word usage errors. Therefore, it meets all of the requirements for being a grammatical English sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb 'devour' means to eat something quickly and eagerly because you enjoy it very much. A crocodile would more likely consume or swallow its food whole rather than devouring it. Additionally, a crocodile wouldn't typically eat a doughnut as they do not consume human food.	The sentence should be: "The crocodile consumed the doughnut," although it's worth noting that this corrected sentence still doesn't make logical sense since crocodiles don't eat doughnuts.
1	The sentence "John is afraid of Bill" is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("John"), a verb ("is afraid") and an object ("Bill"). There are no spelling errors, punctuation errors, or grammatical errors.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence is missing a preposition after "under". It should be either "John put something under the bathtub" or "John put the bathtub under something", depending on what John is doing and where he is putting the bathtub.	John put something under the bathtub.
1	The sentence "John placed Kim behind the garage" is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("John"), a verb ("placed") and an object ("Kim"). In addition, it includes a prepositional phrase ("behind the garage") which describes where the action took place. All of these elements work together to form a complete thought, making the sentence grammatical correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence is missing a verb to complete its meaning. It appears that it's trying to express that one person relies on another, but without a verb such as "relies" or "depends," it doesn't make sense.	The sentence should be either "Kim depends on Sandy" or "Sandy depends on Kim", depending on who is relying on whom.
1	The sentence "John put the book in the box" is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("John"), a verb ("put") in past tense, a direct object ("the book"), and an indirect object ("the box"). All of these elements agree with each other, so there are no grammatical errors.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no spelling errors, punctuation errors, subject-verb agreement issues, tense inconsistencies, or incorrect word usage.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "John regards Bill as a good friend" is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("John"), a verb ("regards"), and an object ("Bill"). The prepositional phrase "as a good friend" functions as an adverbial of reason, explaining why John regards Bill. There are no grammatical errors in terms of tense agreement, word order, or pronoun usage.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and has a clear subject ("Kim") and verb ("put"). It also contains an object of the preposition ("the box"), which completes the meaning of the sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It has a clear subject ("the chickens") and verb ("seem"), and expresses a complete thought. There are no spelling errors or awkward phrasings to detract from its clarity and meaning.	The sentence is already correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It follows standard subject-verb-object word order, uses a plural noun ("executives") with a plural verb ("be"), and expresses a clear idea without any grammatical errors.	The rules require that the executives be polite. (The sentence is already correct.)
0	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in this sentence. The singular verb "was" does not agree with its plural subject "Fred and Bill". Additionally, there is a missing conjunction between "Fred" and "nominated", which makes the sentence grammatically awkward and confusing.	The sentence should be corrected as follows - "That Fred was unpopular, so he nominated Bill."
1	The sentence "They were taking a hard look at possible FTA" is grammatically correct. There are no spelling errors, punctuation errors, or word order issues. The subject ("they") agrees with the verb ("were taking"), and the object of the preposition ("at") is clear and specific.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The preposition "against" is used incorrectly in this context. Here, it suggests that John paid money to someone else while taking a book from you, which is unlikely to be the intended meaning. Instead, the proper preposition would be "for," indicating payment made for acquiring something.	John paid me for the book.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and conveys a clear meaning. The subject ("the committee") is followed by a verb tense that makes sense for the context ("will study"), and there are no obvious errors in word choice, spelling, or punctuation.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "made" is a transitive verb, which means it requires a direct object to complete its meaning. In this case, "them" is serving as the direct object of "made". However, there needs to be another word after "them" because we can't just make someone without specifying what action they were forced to do. Therefore, the sentence is grammatically incorrect.	The sentence should either specify the action performed by "them", such as "We made them be quiet," or use a different verb that doesn't require an additional action, such as "We made them feel uncomfortable."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and makes sense semantically. There is a clear subject ("Judy"), verb ("threw"), and object ("it") in the sentence, making the meaning of the sentence clear to the reader. Additionally, there is no spelling or punctuation errors present in the sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "studying" is incorrect because it does not agree with its subject "Students." Since students is a plural noun, the present participle form of the verb must also be in its third person plural form. Therefore, "study" would be the correct choice here instead of "studying". Additionally, there should be no possessive "'s" after "English," as it is being used as an adjective to describe which students are reading the book.	Students study Conrad's Heart of Darkness while at university.
0	The sentence is missing a determiner before the word 'book'. In English, we need to specify whether we're referring to a specific book ('the book') or any book ('a book'). Without a determiner, the sentence sounds incomplete and unnatural.	I read some of the book. OR I read some of a book.
1	The sentence "Most of the fruit is rotten" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "Most" is used correctly as a determiner to indicate quantity. It agrees with the singular noun "fruit," which refers to a collective group. * The verb "is" agrees with the subject "most of the fruit" in number, indicating third-person singular present tense. This is appropriate for a singular subject like "fruit." * "Rotten" describes the state of the fruit and follows the copular verb "is." Therefore, I would rate this sentence as grammatically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence "Neither of students failed" is incorrect because it lacks a determiner before "students". It should be "neither of the students", "neither of his students", etc., depending on the intended meaning.	Neither of the students failed.
0	The sentence "I drank some of water" is incorrect because it lacks a determiner before "water". In English, we need to specify how much or which part of something we are referring to when using "some", so it should be followed by a noun or pronoun without its own determiners such as "of it" or just simply "some water".	I drank some water.
0	The noun "hair" should be plural because it refers to many strands of gold-colored fibers on someone's head. Therefore, the correct form would be "golden hairs," although we often use the word "hair" as singular even when referring to multiple strands for simplicity. However, since I am asked only to check if the sentence is grammatically correct without making any assumptions about its intended meaning, I will consider "a golden hair" incorrect.	The sentence is not correct. A more appropriate version could be "It is made of golden hair" or simply "Its hair is golden."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct and easy to understand. It has a clear subject ("the boy"), verb ("waived"), and object ("to his father"). Additionally, it uses appropriate prepositions ("in" and "to") to indicate location and direction respectively. There are no spelling errors or awkward phrasings.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence contains a logical error. A dog cannot bite itself because if it tries to do so, it would be biting another part of its own body, not itself. Therefore, the reflexive pronoun "itself" is incorrect in this context. It should be replaced by a regular object pronoun such as "its".	The sentence should read: "That dog is so ferocious, it even tried to bite its own leg/tail/etc." (choose any appropriate body part depending on the situation described.)
0	The verb 'washed' must be followed by a object pronoun such as 'him', 'her', or 'them'. In this case, since the subject of the sentence is 'he', the objective form of the pronoun should be used for the direct object. Therefore, 'yourself' should be changed to 'you'. This is because 'yourself' is a reflexive pronoun which indicates that the subject and the object refer to the same person. However, there is no need for a reflexive pronoun here because the subject has already been mentioned explicitly.	He washed you.
0	The sentence "John is easy to please Kim" is grammatically incorrect because it lacks a preposition such as "for" after "please". Without the necessary preposition, the relationship between the two objects of the preposition (Kim and John) cannot be clearly established.	The correct sentence would be "John is easy to please for Kim", or better yet, "John is easily pleased by Kim".
0	The sentence is missing a noun after "intelligent". A complete thought requires both a subject and predicate. In this case, "there" is used as a placeholder for the subject but there needs to be an actual subject present for the sentence to make sense.	The sentence could be corrected by adding a suitable noun such as "people", making it read: "There seemed to be intelligent people."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and understandable.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence "We believed John to be a fountain in the park" is grammatically incorrect because it assigns human qualities ("we believed") to an inanimate object ("a fountain"). Moreover, using "to be" after a verb indicates a belief about someone's identity or profession, which does not make sense when applied to a non-human entity such as a fountain. Additionally, the preposition "in" implies that the fountain exists within something else, but no other location has been specified.	A more appropriate version of this sentence might read: "We thought we saw a man who resembled John near the fountain in the park."
0	The subject of the sentence ("it") does not have a clear antecedent, which makes it unclear what or who is trying to leave the country. Additionally, there is no verb agreement between the singular subject "it" and the plural form of the verb "tries".	The correct sentence would be "It tries to leave the country." only if we know from context what or who "it" refers to. Otherwise, we need to specify the subject, for example: "He tries to leave the country." or "The dog tries to leave the country."
1	The sentence "John tries to leave the country" is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple tense verb ("tries") followed by a subject ("John"), and an infinitive phrase ("to leave the country").	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Under the bed seems to be a fun place to hide" is grammatically correct. There are no spelling errors, punctuation errors, or grammatical errors in the sentence. The verb tense is consistent throughout the sentence, and the subject-verb agreement is also correct. Therefore, I would rate this sentence as being grammatically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "is" does not agree in number with its subject "there is believed to be sheep". It should be "are", because "sheep" is a plural noun.	There are believed to be sheep in the park.
0	The subject of the sentence hopes to do something in the future, so we use the base form of the verb after "to". Therefore, it should be "I hope to study" instead of "I hope to would study".	I hope to study in France.
1	The sentence follows standard English grammar rules and uses proper vocabulary. There are no spelling errors or punctuation issues.	The sentence is already correct.
0	In English, we don't say "John will rain tomorrow" because only weather conditions can rain, not people. Instead, if you want to express that it will be raining on a day when someone named John is coming, you could say "It will be raining when John comes tomorrow".	It will be raining when John comes tomorrow.
0	The subject "there" does not require a verb ending in "-s" because it is used as a placeholder and not as the actual subject of the sentence. In addition, "will" should be contracted to "'ll". The correct formulation would be "It's going to rain," or if using "there", "There is going to be rain."	There is going to be rain.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and makes sense semantically. There is a subject ("John"), a verb ("was found") and a prepositional phrase ("in the office") which describes where John was found. Therefore, there are no grammatical errors to point out.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb tense used in this question is incorrect. Instead of using "did" which implies past tense, it should use "is" to indicate present tense since there's no indication that we're referring to a specific time in the past. A more appropriate way to ask this question would be "Is the child in the school?" but even so, the phrasing itself sounds awkward because typically children aren't referred to as being 'in' schools; they attend them. So perhaps what was meant was simply "Is the child at school?"	Is the child at school?
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows the standard subject-verb-object structure and uses proper tense.	The sentence is already correct.
0	In English, we typically use a negative verb form such as "doesn't" instead of "not" after a subject and before the base form of the verb when expressing a negation. Therefore, the sentence "John doesn't want to leave the town" would be grammatically correct.	John doesn't want to leave the town.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It contains two independent clauses ("Mary likes to tour art galleries" and "Bill hates to") connected by a coordinating conjunction ("but"). Each clause has a subject ("Mary," "Bill") and a verb ("likes," "hates"), making the sentence clear and easy to understand.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "They needn't take this exam" is grammatically correct. The word "needn't" is a contraction of "do not need," which functions as a negator here. It indicates that taking the exam is unnecessary for them. Therefore, there is no mistake in using "needn't" instead of "don't need" in this context.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Ann may spend her vacation in Italy" is grammatically correct. Here's a breakdown of why it works: * "Ann" is a proper noun used as the subject of the sentence, indicating who will be spending their vacation in Italy. * "may spend" indicates possibility or permission, which fits within the context of planning a vacation. It also agrees with the third-person singular subject "Ann," using the auxiliary verb "may" followed by the base form of the main verb "spend." * "her" refers to Ann, demonstrating possession over the upcoming vacation plans. * "vacation" is correctly spelled and serves as the direct object for the action described by "spend." * "in Italy" shows where Ann intends to go on her vacation. The preposition "in" precedes the location "Italy," forming a prepositional phrase modifying "vacation."	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence follows the subject-verb agreement rule and uses proper punctuation. There are no grammatical errors in the use of tenses, spelling, or word choice.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is a question asking for confirmation about something that has already been stated ("George has spent a lot of money"). It uses the auxiliary verb "has" together with a negative form of the auxiliary verb "to do" ("hasn't") to create a tag question, which is grammatically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence contains an error known as a split infinitive. In traditional English grammar, it's considered incorrect to insert a word between "to" and a verb. Although many people now accept split infinitives in informal contexts, they are generally still avoided in formal writing. Therefore, we need to revise the original sentence to avoid splitting the infinitive.	As a statesman, he could scarcely do anything worth mentioning.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The past tense verb "found" agrees with its subject "we," and the object "any of the unicorns" follows a preposition ("of") which indicates possession. There are no misspellings, missing words, or awkward phrasings to correct.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and there are no spelling errors.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There is a clear subject ("somebody"), a proper verb tense for the time of the action described ("struck"), and no spelling or punctuation errors.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "The car was driven" is grammatically correct. It consists of a noun phrase ("the car") acting as the subject, followed by a linking verb ("was"), and another noun phrase ("driven") functioning as the past participle serving as the predicate nominative. This structure indicates that the action described by the verb happened to the subject.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows the standard subject-verb-object structure, where "Ricky" is the subject, "can be" is the verb, and "relied on" is the predicate indicating a possibility about Ricky's reliability. There are no grammatical errors or awkward phrasings in this sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The past participle of the verb "sleep" can be used as an adjective to describe the state of something or someone after sleeping. In this case, it's grammatically correct to say "the bed was slept in," which means that someone had previously slept in the bed.	The bed was slept in.
0	The verb tense used in this sentence does not agree. In present perfect tense, which is used here ("was weighed"), both the auxiliary verb and the past participle form of the main verb must be in agreement. Here, the verb "weigh" should have been changed to its past participle form, i.e., "weighed", after the auxiliary verb "was". However, since it has already been done so, there's redundancy, leading to a grammatical error. This could also be rephrased as 'A pound had been weighed by the book.' for better clarity.	The sentence should read either 'A pound was weighed on the book', meaning the weight measurement device named 'pound' was placed on top of the book; or 'A pound had been weighed by the book', indicating some action associated with weighing using the book was completed before another time-related event occurred.
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect due to the misplaced question mark. In addition, there is a missing pronoun before the verb "saw". A more appropriate way to ask this question would be "Who do you think Tom saw?" or "Whom did Tom see?".	Who do you think Tom saw?
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and has a clear subject ("he"), verb ("had spent"), and object ("five thousand dollars"). There are no spelling errors or awkward phrasings. Therefore, it meets all of the basic requirements for a grammatical sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The subject of the second clause ("her") does not agree with its verb ("to vote"). In addition, there is a missing pronoun before "vote". A possible correction could be: "Fed knows which politician she should vote for."	Fed knows which politician she should vote for.
0	The sentence is in the form of a question, but it lacks a question mark at the end to indicate this. Additionally, there seems to be some missing context for this sentence. A more complete version might be something like "How did you guess that he had fixed the computer?"	The sentence I provided in the explanation above would be one way to correct this sentence. Another possibility could be "I wonder how you knew he repaired the computer." Without additional context, it's difficult to say exactly what the intended meaning of the original sentence was, so multiple corrections may be possible.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It uses the relative pronoun "whose" correctly to refer to a singular noun ("efforts") and it contains no spelling errors or awkward phrasing.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb in the sentence should agree with its subject in number. In this case, the subject of the sentence is "friend," which is singular. Therefore, the verb should also be singular, i.e., "live" instead of "lives".	Which house does your friend live in?
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It uses a relative clause ("from whom I bought these bagels") to modify the noun "baker," which is a correct way to provide additional information about the person being referred to. There are no spelling errors, punctuation errors, or other grammatical issues in the sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and makes sense in context. It has a clear subject ("I"), verb ("found"), and object ("the place"). The word "where" introduces a clause that functions as the direct object of the sentence, which is also grammatically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The preposition "with" is only used before the object of the verb "fall in love," so it should be placed after "Jenny," not after "whom."	Jack is the person whom Jenny fell in love with. Alternatively, a more common way to phrase this would be "Jack is the one whom Jenny fell in love with."
1	The sentence "There is a bench to sit on" is grammatically correct. It has a subject ("there"), a linking verb ("is"), a noun phrase ("a bench") acting as the subject complement, and an infinitive phrase ("to sit on") functioning as an adverbial of purpose, explaining why the bench exists.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence ("I") is clear, and the verb tense is consistent throughout the sentence. Additionally, the relative clause "who grows peaches" correctly modifies the noun "man," providing more information about his identity. There is also a proper use of articles ("the").	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb tense used in the sentence is incorrect. It should be "had chosen" instead of "did choose". This is because the action of choosing something before someone else's action requires a past perfect tense. Additionally, there is no need for a pronoun after "without", making the corrected sentence: "Which topic had you chosen without his approval?"	Which topic had you chosen without his approval?
0	The sentence contains a mistake known as a fragment sentence. A complete sentence needs to have both a subject and a predicate. In this case, there is no main verb for the subject "which topic". This makes it difficult to understand what the speaker is trying to express.	Which topic did you find boring because Mary talked about it so much? Alternatively, you could say "I got bored of the topic that Mary kept talking about."
1	The sentence "That is the reason why he resigned" is grammatically correct. It consists of a noun clause ("that is the reason") followed by the subordinating conjunction "why," which introduces another clause explaining the reason for his resignation. Both clauses contain complete thoughts and are punctuated correctly, making the overall structure clear and easy to understand.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "It bothers me that John coughs" is grammatically correct. Here, "it" refers to the implied subject of the sentence, which is the situation or fact that John's coughing bothers the speaker. This use of "it" as a pronoun referring to a situation or fact is called a "dummy it," and it is commonly used in English grammar. Therefore, there is no need to change anything in the given sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "to please" should be followed by a subject, not an object. In this case, it should say "John is easy to please," meaning that John can easily be made happy or satisfied.	John is easy to please.
1	The sentence "Kim is eager to please Tom" is grammatically correct. It consists of a noun phrase ("Kim"), a linking verb ("is"), and another noun phrase ("eager to please Tom"). There are no spelling errors, missing words, or incorrect word forms.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence is grammatically correct but informal. However, based on the prompt's requirement for a binary response, I will consider it as incorrect due to its informality.	It's regrettable that we invaded Iraq.
0	The sentence starts with a conjunction "It" which is incorrect as per grammar rules. Conjunctions cannot start a sentence. Also, there seems to be no clear antecedent for the pronoun "it".	The sentence could be corrected as follows - "Fido's barking annoys me."
0	The sentence contains a common error known as a misplaced modifier. In this case, "who achieved the best result" is a relative clause acting as an adjective to describe a noun, but it's unclear what noun it's describing because there's no specific noun nearby. To fix the issue, we can add a noun for clarity, such as "student," making the corrected sentence "Who among the students achieved the best result was Angela." Alternatively, if context has established that only one person could have achieved the best result, we could simply say "Angela achieved the best result."	Angela achieved the best result.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There is a clear subject ("the peasant girl"), a verb ("got"), and a direct object ("it"). The word order follows standard English syntax rules.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The error in this sentence occurs in the use of two objects ("anyone" and "to look after") following "hard to find". In modern English, we typically express such ideas using a gerund (-ing form verb), so the corrected version would be "That kind of person is hard to find **to look after** *anyone*." Alternatively, it could also be rephrased as "It's difficult to find anyone who can take care of that kind of person."	It's difficult to find anyone who can take care of that kind of person.
0	The adverb "sick" usually describes a person's physical condition and implies feeling unwell due to illness. However, when used to describe animals, it often means they have a contagious disease. In this context, using "sick" to modify "owl" can be misleading since it suggests the owl might have a transmissible illness rather than simply being weak or unable to hunt. Instead, we could use an alternative word such as "ill," which is more appropriate for describing non-human subjects in poor health. Additionally, the present tense of the verb "doesn't" instead of "does no longer" may imply a permanent state, whereas recovery from illness is typically temporary.	An ill owl doesn't hunt mice anymore.
0	The subject of the sentence is "each candidate," which is singular. However, the verb "will be admitted" is plural. This inconsistency makes the sentence grammatically incorrect.	Each candidate who has an interest in semantics will be admitted to the department.
1	The verb "do" must agree in number with its subject, so "she" which is singular requires "does" instead of "don't", which is used for plural subjects.	"She doesn't like spinach." And here is an example of how my response would look for a sentence that does not require correction: Sentence: "He walks to school every day." Label: 1 Explanation: This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject "he" agrees with the verb "walks," and the adverbial clause "every day" provides additional information about when the action takes place. The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence contains a spelling mistake. The word "got" should be replaced with "have gotten" to maintain proper verb tense agreement. In this context, have gotten indicates present perfect tense which is appropriate as it refers to something that happened in the past but has relevance to the current moment ("even").	We are sure we have even gotten these tickets!
0	The sentence contains a spelling mistake. The word "sure" is misspelled as "suer". Additionally, there is missing punctuation at the end of the sentence.	The sentence should be: "I'm even sure we have these tickets!" or "We must surely have these tickets!" depending on the intended meaning.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are two independent clauses joined by the coordinating conjunction "that". Each clause has a subject ("I" and "he") and a verb ("have" and "helped"). Additionally, there is a clear contrast being drawn between the speaker's lack of sympathy for urban guerrillas and their decision to help someone.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "it", which refers to the implied statement that the speaker is angry. The reason for the anger is explained by a clause beginning with "because". This clause contains another subject ("Sue") and predicate ("said anything bad about me"). Both clauses contain subjects and verbs and agree in number, making the sentence grammatical.	The sentence is already correct.
0	This sentence contains a comma splice error because it joins two independent clauses ("That he was hungry" and "John whined") with only a comma.	The corrected sentence would be either of the following options: * That he was hungry, John began to whine. * He was hungry; John whined. * He was hungry, so John whined.
0	The sentence contains two errors related to word order. In English, when there are multiple objects of a verb, they should be separated by commas if both come after the verb. Also, the indirect object ("Mary") should precede the direct object ("a book"). Here's how it should be written:	I gave a book to Mary after the party. Confidence level: 95%
0	The second part of the sentence "as for Mary I really like her" is incorrect because it uses "as for" unnecessarily. A more appropriate way to express this would be simply "I really like her". Also, there should be a comma after "Pleasant," to separate two independent clauses.	Because she's so pleasant, I really like her.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It contains a subordinating conjunction ("though") which introduces a dependent clause ("Though he may hate those that criticize Carter"), followed by a independent clause ("it doesn't matter"). Both clauses contain proper verb agreement and punctuation.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The subject of the sentence needs to agree with the verb in number. In this case, since the subject ("With no job") is singular, the verb should also be singular. Therefore, the sentence "With no job would John be happy" is incorrect because it uses a plural form of the verb ("would...be") for a singular subject. A correct version of the sentence could use the singular form of the verb "to be," such as "With no job, John would be unhappy."	With no job, John would be unhappy.
0	The correct form of the verb to match "much" is "has," not "have." This is because "much" requires a singular verb when used as the subject of a sentence.	I have much of the manuscript left to type. (should be) I have *got* much of the manuscript left to type. OR The sentence is already correct if it's written as follows: "I have a lot of the manuscript left to type."
1	The sentence "He's a more reliable man" is grammatically correct. Here, "he's" is a contraction of "he is," which serves as the subject of the sentence. The comparative adjective "more" modifies the adjective "reliable," indicating a greater degree of reliability compared to someone else. Finally, "man" functions as the direct object of the sentence, receiving the action of being described as more reliable. Therefore, there are no grammatical errors in this sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The word "any" is used incorrectly in this context. A better way to express this idea would be to say "I don't want any kind of trouble," which makes it clear that you are referring to all types of trouble. Alternatively, you could simply say "I don't want trouble," if that captures your intended meaning.	I don't want trouble.
1	The sentence "They may grow as high as bamboo" is grammatically correct. It has a clear subject ("they"), verb ("may grow"), and a meaningful comparison using "as...as". However, it could be improved for clarity by specifying what kind of plants or objects can grow as high as bamboo.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "made" does not agree with its subject "some of them". Since the subject refers to multiple people, a plural verb must be used. Therefore, "made" should be changed to "have made".	Some of them have made as many errors as 20.
0	The subject of the sentence, "Sally," is a singular female noun, so it requires a reflexive pronoun ending in "-self" rather than "-selves". Therefore, the correct form of the reflexive pronoun to use here would be "herself", making the correct sentence "Sally kissed herself."	Sally kissed herself.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no spelling errors, punctuation marks are used correctly, and the word order follows standard English syntax rules. Moreover, the verb tenses agree, making it a well-constructed sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence follows all of the standard rules for capitalization and punctuation in English. Proper nouns such as names are capitalized, and there is a comma separating each name except for the last two which are connected by the conjunction "and".	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and uses appropriate punctuation. The verb tense is consistent throughout the sentence, and there are no spelling errors. The word "hopefully" is used correctly to express hope for a future event.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The subject of the second clause ("Betsy is pretty") is "Betsy," which is a third-person singular pronoun. Therefore, the verb must agree with it and be in its third-person singular form. In this case, however, the verb "shows" is used instead of "showes", which does not match the subject's number. Additionally, the gender of the subject and the object do not match; "Blue leather" implies something non-human and inanimate, while "herself" suggests a female human being.	The corrected sentence could be "The blue leather handbag shows off how pretty Betsy looks." Here, both verbs ("shows" and "looks") are in their third-person singular forms, and they grammatically refer to the appropriate subjects. Also, there is no mismatch between the genders of the objects referred to by "blue leather" and "how pretty Betsy looks".
1	The sentence "Gwen hit the baseball" is grammatically correct. It consists of a proper noun ("Gwen") as the subject, followed by a verb ("hit") in past tense, and another noun ("baseball") as the object. All elements agree with each other in number, making it a well-formed sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "hit" does not agree with its subject "I". It should be "I hit upon" or "I guessed", etc. Also, there is a missing article before "answer".	I figured out that you knew the answer.
1	The sentence is correct as it stands. It is a grammatically valid way to express the idea of having lost either one's wallet or one's sanity. This construction uses the correlative conjunction "either...or," which requires a parallel structure between the two elements being connected. In this case, both elements ("my wallet" and "my mind") are noun phrases functioning as objects of the verb "lost." Each element has been appropriately introduced by the possessive determiner "my," making the overall structure balanced and clear.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence ("he") is clearly identified, and the verb tense is consistent throughout the sentence. Additionally, the adjective "brand new" correctly modifies the noun "car," which follows proper word order for an English sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct as it follows the standard structure of a simple sentence - subject ("he") + verb ("likes"/"hates") + object ("cookies"/"crumb cake"). Each clause contains a single independent thought, so no coordinate conjunction such as "and" requires a comma before it. There is also no need for a serial comma after "cookies" because there are only two items being compared.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "They chased the man with the car" is grammatically correct. Here, "with the car" functions as an adverbial of means, modifying how "they" chased the man. It indicates the manner in which the action occurred. Therefore, it's a proper usage of preposition 'with'.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "I didn't have a red cent" is grammatically correct. It is an idiomatic expression in American English which means that the speaker had no money at all.	The sentence is already correct.
0	In this sentence, there is no conjunction linking "the book of poems" and "from Blackwell," which makes it unclear what "from Blackwell" modifies. Additionally, we need either an article ("a") before "very long time" or a possessive form such as "'s" after "time" for grammaticality. Lastly, there seems to be some missing words to make the meaning clearer; perhaps something like 'it takes' between "read" and "a".	The sentence could be corrected as follows: "Reading the book of poems and getting it from Blackwell takes a very long time."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There is a noun ("the one"), which is modified by a relative clause ("with a red cover") and followed by a verb phrase ("takes a very long time to read"). This structure creates a complete thought, making it a proper sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and the word "fear" is used correctly as it shows an emotional response from the subject towards dogs.	The sentence is already correct.
0	In this sentence, we have a subject-verb agreement error. The subject of the sentence is "the building," which is singular. Therefore, the verb must also be singular. However, the verb "is" is paired with the plural noun phrase "the roof." To fix this error, we need to change the verb to match the number of the subject.	The building's roof is leaking. OR The building's roofs are leaking. In the first corrected version, I changed "the roof is" to "roof is" so that the verb agrees with the singular subject "building." In the second corrected version, if there are multiple roofs on the building, then both "buildings" and "roofs" would be plural, and they would agree.
0	The noun "coat" is incorrectly used here as it refers to a piece of clothing that someone wears. In this context, what is meant is the fur or skin of the panther. Therefore, the possessive form "panther's" should be followed by "fur" or "skin," but not "coat."	The panther's fur is dark black.
1	The sentence follows all of the standard rules for English grammar and punctuation, so it's grammatically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	This sentence is grammatically incorrect because it implies that two different men are being referred to - one who got into the taxi and another who robbed the bank. However, from context, we can infer that they're actually referring to the same person. To fix the grammar issue, a pronoun such as "he" could be used instead of repeating "the man".	The man I saw get into the cab robbed the bank. OR The man I saw get into the cab later robbed the bank.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and makes sense in context.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It consists of a subject ("John's drum"), a verb ("will bother"), and an object ("me"). Additionally, it uses the future tense appropriately to indicate that the action of the drum bothering the speaker is expected to continue into the future.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and makes sense in context. There is a subject ("an evil thought"), a verb ("struck"), and an object ("Dave"). The word order follows standard English rules, and there are no spelling errors or awkward phrasings.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "In the classroom John put the book on the table" is grammatically correct. It contains a clear subject ("John"), a verb ("put") that agrees with the subject in number, and an object ("the book"). Additionally, it includes the proper preposition ("on") to indicate location and a complete thought.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence follows all of the necessary grammar rules for standard English. It has a clear subject ("Phillip"), verb ("gave"), and object ("the medal"). Additionally, it includes proper prepositional phrases ("to the soldier") which further clarify meaning without breaking any rules.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb 'thinks' requires a base form of the verb after it when used as an object complement. In this case, 'Andy to eat salmon flavored candy bars' is incorrect because it uses an infinitive form ('to eat') instead of a base form ('eat'). Also, there should be a conjunction such as 'that' between 'thinks' and 'Andy'.	Heidi thinks that Andy eats salmon-flavored candy bars.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and makes sense semantically. There is a subject ("Heidi") who is expressing her opinion about something ("Andy should eat salmon-flavored candy bars"). Both the grammar and word choice are appropriate for standard written English.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "He danced" is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple sentence with a subject ("he") and a verb ("danced"). Both words are spelled correctly and there are no punctuation errors. Therefore, it meets all the requirements for a grammatically correct sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "did" requires a helping verb to form a question in English. In addition, the subject of the sentence needs to be placed after the helping verb for proper question formation. Therefore, the correct version would be "Did Calvin do his homework?" rather than "Did Calvin his homework?" because it follows standard grammatical rules for forming questions in English.	The corrected sentence is "Did Calvin do his homework?"
1	The sentence "Sylvia was slapping Jeff upside the head in martial arts class" is grammatically correct. There are no spelling errors, punctuation errors, or grammatical errors in the sentence. Additionally, the word choice and syntax are appropriate for standard American English.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It has a conditional structure where if-clause expresses a hypothetical situation ("If I am a rich man") and the main clause gives the consequence of that situation ("I'd buy a diamond ring"). Both clauses have a subject and a verb, and they agree in number. Moreover, the verb tense is consistent within each clause. Therefore, there is no need to change anything in the sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The verb form "he'd" is a contraction of "he would," which is used appropriately here to indicate past unreal condition. The sentence expresses a hypothetical situation, so it uses the subjunctive mood, making "were" instead of "was" grammatically correct for singular subjects such as "he."	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "John is likely to leave" is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("John"), a helping verb ("is") indicating likelihood, and an infinitive verb form ("to leave"). There are no spelling errors, punctuation errors, or word usage errors.	The sentence is already correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct as it follows the standard structure of a simple sentence - Subject + Verb + Object. Here, 'manager' acts as the subject, 'laughed' acts as the verb. There is no object present in the sentence which is perfectly fine for a complete thought to be conveyed.	The sentence is already correct. No changes needed.
0	The sentence "Was sunk" is not grammatically complete as it lacks a proper subject and context for clarity. It appears to be a verb tense form of "to sink," but without more information about what noun or pronoun is performing the action, we cannot determine if the sentence is being used correctly. Additionally, since there is no clear subject, it's impossible to know whether the past participle "was sunk" has been properly conjugated.	Without knowing the intended meaning, I will provide two examples using different subjects: - The ship was sunk by enemy fire during World War II. - My hopes were sunk when I heard the bad news.
0	The verb "think" is used incorrectly in this context. It would be more appropriate to say "Who do you think kissed the gorilla?" if asking about someone's opinion on who might have performed the action. Alternatively, if simply seeking information about a past event, the sentence could be rephrased as "Who kissed the gorilla?"	Who do you think kissed the gorilla?
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and has a clear meaning. It follows standard English syntax rules and contains no spelling errors.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence appears to be grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Lucy," which is a proper noun and correctly spelled. The verb "was" agrees with the singular subject "Lucy" in number. The past tense "mugged" describes the action taken against Lucy and is appropriately used in this context. Overall, there do not appear to be any grammatical errors in this sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and makes sense semantically. There is nothing wrong with the use of tenses, word choice, or sentence structure.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It uses the past tense verb "were" to agree with its plural subject "four men", and it correctly uses the present participle form of a verb ("arriving") after the word "when".	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Jean is reluctant to dance" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Jean," which is a proper noun and therefore capitalized. The verb of the sentence is "is," which agrees with the singular subject "Jean." The predicate of the sentence is "reluctant to dance," which correctly describes Jean's attitude towards dancing using the adjective "reluctant" followed by the infinitive "to dance." There are no grammatical errors in this sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "I want her to dance" is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("I"), a verb ("want") and an infinitive phrase acting as the direct object of the sentence ("her to dance").	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Jean persuaded Robert" is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple sentence structure: subject (Jean), verb (persuaded), object (Robert). There are no spelling errors, punctuation issues, or grammatical inconsistencies in this sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence follows all of the standard rules for grammar, punctuation, spelling, and word usage in English, so it's grammatically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a simple sentence, which includes a subject ("the children") and a predicate ("admire their mother"). Additionally, the verb tense is consistent throughout the sentence, and all words are spelled correctly.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows the standard structure of a question in English by inverting the order of the subject ("Peter") and auxiliary verb ("has"), which is necessary to form a proper question. Additionally, it uses the past participle form of the main verb ("talked") correctly. Therefore, there's no need to make any corrections.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence follows all of the rules for standard written English grammar, making it a grammatically correct sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The error in this sentence lies in the pronoun choice of "himself" instead of "she." In the context of this sentence, "himself" refers to "John," but since the subject of the second clause ("Mary") is feminine gender, a correctly gendered reflexive pronoun must be used. Therefore, the correct form would be "John thinks that Mary loves herself."	John thinks that Mary loves herself.
0	The sentence contains a small error known as a pronoun ambiguity. It's unclear whether 'himself' refers to John or someone else. A better way to ask the question would be, "Which pictures of him does John like?" This makes it clear that we're talking about someone other than John.	Which pictures of him does John like?
0	The word "any" is used incorrectly in this context. It implies a lack of restriction or limitation, which does not make sense when referring to a specific animal such as an owl. Instead, we would use "an" or "a" to indicate that we're talking about one particular owl.	An owl hunts mice.
0	This sentence contains a double negative ("any" + "didn't"), which results in incorrect grammar. The use of "any" before a negated verb implies a negative meaning, so using "didn't" after it creates redundancy and confusion. It would be better to say "No man ate dinner" if we want to convey a negative statement.	No man ate dinner.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The modal verb "could" indicates possibility in the present tense, which fits the context of the sentence. Additionally, there is a subject-verb agreement between "pilot" and "be," as well as appropriate use of the third person singular form of the verb. There are no punctuation errors, misspellings, or awkward phrasings.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It uses a subordinating conjunction ("whoever") to connect two clauses and sets up a relationship between them. In this case, it means that everyone who went to last week's big rally signed the petition, regardless of their identity.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and uses appropriate punctuation marks. There are no spelling errors as well.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in this sentence. The plural noun "tigers" requires a plural verb form such as "have," so the sentence should read "Any tigers have orange fur, marked with black stripes." This error may seem minor, but it's essential to maintain grammatical consistency in writing.	Any tigers have orange fur, marked with black stripes.
0	Albinism is a genetic condition characterized by the lack of pigment in the skin, hair, and eyes. In animals such as tigers, this means that they would have white fur, not orange. Therefore, the statement “Any albino tiger has orange fur” is incorrect.	The sentence should be: “Any albino tiger has white fur, marked with black stripes.”
0	The verb 'pick' needs to agree with its subject 'you' in number. Since 'you' is singular, we need to use a singular form of the verb 'pick'. Therefore, it should be 'picks', not 'pick'.	You must pick any flower you see. (no change required as I corrected the error above)
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It uses the modal verb "could" to indicate possibility in the present tense, which agrees with its subject "any pilot". Additionally, it correctly employs the past participle form of the verb "be", creating a passive structure ("could be flying"). Finally, there's no punctuation error.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence follows all of the necessary grammatical rules and has proper syntax, making it grammatically correct. There are no spelling errors or misplaced words, and the subject-verb agreement is also correct.	The sentence is already correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct because it uses parallel structure to connect two independent clauses with the conjunction "and". Both of these clauses follow the subject-verb-object pattern ("the Dodgers beat the Red Sox" and "were beaten by the Giants").	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It has a question form with the subject-auxiliary inversion ("was" comes before "the man"). Also, it contains all necessary parts such as a noun phrase ("the man"), a verb ("was seen") and a prepositional phrase ("in which car"). There are no spelling, punctuation or grammar errors found in this sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
0	This sentence contains a common grammatical error known as a "dangling modifier." In this case, the phrase "computed my tax" is intended to modify "the man," but it's unclear which specific man performed this action. Instead, the sentence should specify which man computed the taxes by saying something like "The man whom Mary loves and Sally hates computed my taxes."	The man whom Mary loves and Sally hates computed my taxes.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("the kennel") and two verb phrases ("Mary made" and "has been stolen"). Additionally, it uses appropriate punctuation to separate clauses.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence follows all of the rules of standard written English and does not contain any grammatical errors or typos.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and uses appropriate punctuation marks. There are no spelling errors as well. Therefore, there's nothing to correct in the sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure of an English sentence. Additionally, all words used in the sentence are spelled correctly.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "a tall building" is grammatically correct because it contains a determiner ("a"), an adjective ("tall") to describe the noun, and a singular countable noun ("building"). It forms a complete noun phrase which can serve as a subject or object of a sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "This building is tall" is grammatically correct. It consists of a subject ("this building"), a linking verb ("is"), and a complement ("tall"). There are no grammatical errors such as misspelled words, incorrect word order, or missing punctuation.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. Here's a breakdown of why: * "I" is a subject pronoun used correctly as the subject of the sentence. * "like" is a verb indicating possession or preference, used appropriately here to express liking for something. * "the book" refers to a specific book, making it appropriate to use the definite article "the". * "which" introduces a relative clause modifying the noun before it ("book"), clarifying what kind of book is being referred to. * "you" is a subject pronoun used correctly as the indirect object of the sentence. * "gave" is a past tense verb used appropriately to indicate giving something in the past. * "me" is an object pronoun used correctly as the direct object of the sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and concise. It follows standard English syntax rules for subject-verb agreement and word order.	The sentence is already correct.
0	In interrogative sentences, we use auxiliary verb 'do' before subject when the main verb of the sentence is in simple present tense. Therefore, the correct form of the sentence would be - "She asked **did** Alison was coming to the party". However, it still sounds incorrect because we need to change the order of words in a question as well i.e., place the auxiliary verb after the subject. Hence, the corrected sentence becomes - **"She asked was Alison** doing **coming to the party?"**.	She asked was Alison doing coming to the party? OR The sentence can also be corrected by converting the verb into its past participle form and using 'does' instead of 'did'. So, another correct version could be - "She asked did Alison come to the party?"
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It uses the past perfect tense ("had been") to indicate that the action of being offended happened before another past action. This creates a clear sequence of events and emphasizes the degree of offense taken by Sir Thomas.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence follows the standard structure of a simple sentence in English which includes a subject ("Fanny") and a predicate ("regretted having to talk to Aunt Norris"). Additionally, the verb tense is consistent throughout the sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and makes sense in context. There are no obvious spelling errors, subject-verb agreement issues, or other common grammar mistakes.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and the meaning is clear. No changes needed.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence follows all of the necessary grammatical rules for standard English and conveys a clear meaning. There are no spelling errors present in the sentence either. Therefore, it can be concluded that the sentence is grammatically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence is missing a question mark at the end to indicate it as a question. Also, there should be a comma after the name 'John' for clarity.	Who did John, send the book? OR Who did John send the book?
0	In this sentence, there is a misplaced modifier. The word "dismayed" suggests that it was the idea that felt disappointment about something, but clearly, it's actually the Prime Minister who feels dismayed by the idea of the Dome being dull. Therefore, we need to rephrase the sentence so that it's clear what caused the feeling of dismay.	The fact that the Dome was dull dismayed the Prime Minister.
0	The sentence contains an incorrect verb tense agreement error. In English, when we use the subject "he" followed by the word "did," it requires a bare infinitive form of the verb after "did." However, in this case, there is no need for "did" because the sentence can simply be written as "He came right in without so much as a knock." Including "did" creates a redundancy that makes the sentence unnatural and grammatically incorrect.	He came right in without so much as a knock.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and makes sense semantically. There are no spelling errors, punctuation marks are used correctly, and subject-verb agreement is observed. Moreover, word order follows standard English syntax rules.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "The book is boring" is grammatically correct. It consists of a subject ("the book") and a predicate ("is boring"). The subject refers to a singular noun, and the verb agrees with it by being in its third person present form ("is"). There are no spelling errors or punctuation issues.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no spelling errors, punctuation errors, subject-verb agreement issues, or other common grammatical errors.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence follows all of the necessary grammatical rules for standard English and does not contain any spelling errors.	The sentence is already correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It contains a simple subject ("the window") and a verb in the past tense ("was broken"). Additionally, it includes the preposition "with" followed by the object of the preposition ("a hammer"), which describes how the action of breaking occurred.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "The fugitive lay motionless in order to avoid discovery" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "Fugitive" is a singular noun referring to someone who has escaped from legal custody. It takes a singular verb form. In this case, the past tense of the linking verb "to be," which is "lay." Linking verbs connect the subject with additional information about it. They describe the state or condition of being of their subjects. Other examples include "is," "am," "are," "be," "being," and "have been." * "Motionless" means not moving; still. This word modifies how the fugitive was lying. Modifiers provide more information about other words in a sentence by answering questions such as when, where, how, and under what conditions. Adjectives modify nouns and pronouns, while adverbs typically modify verbs, adjectives, and other adverbs. * "In order to avoid discovery" explains the reason for the fugitive's action. Infinitive phrases starting with "in order to" function as adverbials, providing extra details about time, place, manner, cause, or purpose.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "The guard marched the prisoners round the yard" is grammatically correct. There are no spelling errors, punctuation errors, or grammatical errors in this sentence. Moreover, the verb tense ("marched") agrees with the subject ("the guard"), and the word order follows standard English syntax rules.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Frank Churchill crossed the street" is grammatically correct. It contains a proper noun ("Frank Churchill") as the subject, a verb ("crossed"), and a prepositional phrase ("the street") which functions as the object of the verb. There are no spelling errors, punctuation errors, word choice issues, or other grammatical problems.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence follows standard English grammar rules for subject-verb agreement, word order, tense consistency, and punctuation. Both proper nouns ("Emma" and "Harriet") follow a singular verb form ("were"), which agrees with the plural subject of the sentence. Additionally, there are no misspelled words or misplaced modifiers.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The auxiliary verb "might" is used correctly to express possibility, and the subject-verb agreement is maintained throughout the sentence. Additionally, the time expression "by 5 o'clock" indicates when Fiona may arrive, which adds clarity to the sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The conjunction "and" connects two similar phrases, but here it seems to be connecting two different grammatical structures - "I am both expecting to get the job" (a verb phrase) and "of the opinion that it is a desirable one" (a preposition followed by a gerund phrase). This creates a mismatch and makes the sentence grammatically incorrect.	Either revise the sentence as follows: "I both expect to get the job and believe it is a desirable one," or split it into two separate sentences: "I am expecting to get the job. Moreover, I think it's a desirable one."
1	The sentence "Pat was awarded the Golden Fleece Award and very upset about it" is grammatically correct. It contains a complete thought and all of its elements are arranged properly to convey meaning.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence contains two grammatical errors. Firstly, "alienating" should be used instead of "alienated," as the present tense is required to describe ongoing actions. Secondly, there is no possessive form before "beating," making it unclear whose dog is being beaten. A correct version could read: "Kim is alienating the cats and beating his dog."	Kim is alienating the cats and beating his dog.
1	The sentence "They knew that pictures of each other would be on sale" is grammatically correct. The subject "they" agrees with the verb "knew," and the object "pictures of each other" follows a prepositional phrase "of each other." The future tense "would be" indicates that the action has not yet occurred but is expected to happen.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence is a question asking about which article Terry failed to read before filing, but it lacks necessary punctuation and capitalization. Specifically, there should be a question mark at the end of the sentence instead of a period, and the first letter of the word 'which' should be capitalized since it starts the sentence. Additionally, using the definite article 'the' before 'which article' would make the sentence clearer.	Which article did Terry file without reading? Or, more clearly: Which the article did Terry file without reading?
1	The sentence is correctly written according to standard English grammar and spelling rules. No errors were found.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The present participle verb form ("buying") needs to be connected to a subject by using the auxiliary verb "to be" in the present tense ("is"). Also, there must be an article before "whiskey". Here's the corrected version of the sentence:	She goes and **is** buying some whiskey.
0	The subject of the sentence, "Kim and Terry," is plural, so the verb should also be plural. In this case, it should be "are" instead of "is".	Kim and Terry are happy.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and there are no spelling errors. The subject-verb agreement is also correct as "gave" agrees with its plural subject "Kim". In addition, the use of articles before proper nouns follows standard English usage.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and uses proper punctuation. It also conveys a clear meaning without any ambiguity.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The first part of the sentence contains the word "put" which should be in past tense since it refers to something that will happen in the future ("before tomorrow"). Also, there's no need for repetition as both parts of the sentence convey the same meaning.	Place a picture of Bill on your desk by tomorrow; the girl in the red coat will do the same.
0	The sentence contains a grammatical error known as a pronoun ambiguity. It's unclear whether "your" refers to the person being spoken to directly ("you") or to Bill.	Before tomorrow, this girl in the red coat will put a picture of Bill on **her** desk, not his. OR Before tomorrow, this girl in the red coat will put a picture of Bill on **his** desk.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and there are no spelling errors. The use of articles ("a"), prepositions ("of"), and verb tenses are all used appropriately. Additionally, punctuation marks are placed correctly throughout the sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "John became deadly afraid of flying" is grammatically correct. Here, "deadly" is used as an adverb to modify the adjective "afraid", which is a common usage in English language. It means that John developed an intense fear of flying.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "What John promised is to be gentle" is grammatically correct but it might not convey the intended meaning because promises usually refer to actions rather than states of being. A more natural way to express what I believe the speaker intends would be "John promised to act gently" or "John promised to be gentle". However, if we interpret the original sentence as a shortened version of these alternatives, then the grammar is fine.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence contains a minor error known as a question-word fragment. In this case, "which" has been used without specifying what it refers to. A corrected version would be "Henri wants to buy which books about *cooking*?" where "*cooking*" completes the thought of "which". This kind of mistake can lead to confusion for the reader because they may struggle to understand exactly what is being asked. It's important to always provide enough context so readers know precisely what information you seek from them.	Henri wants to buy which books about cooking? (Revised as follows): "Henri wants to buy which books about *cooking*?"
0	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in this sentence. The plural form of the verb "is" should be used because "I" and "the computer" are both plural nouns.	The sentence should read as follows: "I will fix the computers for Carol." OR "I will fix Carol's computer."
1	The sentence "Smith loaned a valuable collection of manuscripts to the library" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Smith," which is the person performing the action. The verb is "loaned," which indicates what action Smith performed. The direct object of the sentence is "a valuable collection of manuscripts," which is what Smith loaned. Finally, the indirect object of the sentence is "the library," which is the recipient of the action. All of these elements work together to form a complete and grammatically correct sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "The paper is cut by Mary" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "the paper," which is in singular form, and the verb "is cut" agrees with it in number. Furthermore, the agent performing the action is identified as "Mary," who correctly follows the verb in passive voice.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. Both "it was from six to nine" and "it took place from six to nine" are valid ways of expressing that something happened between six o'clock and nine o'clock. The first form implies a duration of time, while the second form suggests a specific event happening during that time frame.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There is a subject ("two inspectors"), verb ("arrived") and an object ("INS") in the sentence. Also, it uses the past tense correctly to describe a completed action in the past.	The sentence is already correct.
0	This sentence is a sentence fragment because it lacks a main verb to form a complete thought. Also, there is no punctuation connecting the two clauses, which makes it unclear if they are intended to be separate thoughts or one dependent clause followed by an independent clause.	Either of the following would work as corrected versions of the original sentence: * The soup cooks and thickens. * The soup cooks; it thickens. * As the soup cooks, it thickens.
1	The sentence “I gave money to the charity” is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is “I”, which is a pronoun referring to the speaker. The verb is “gave”, which is in the past tense and agrees with the singular subject. The direct object is “money”. Finally, we have the preposition “to” followed by the indirect object “the charity”. Therefore, there are no grammatical errors in this sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "John asked." is grammatically correct. It consists of a proper noun ("John") followed by a verb in past tense ("asked"). No subject-verb agreement issues or other grammatical errors can be found here.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The subject of the sentence requires a determiner before it to make sense grammatically. In this case, we need to specify which student you saw by adding "the," "a," or another appropriate determiner. For example, if there were multiple students and one caught your attention, you might say, "I saw even a student" or "I saw even the student who always asks questions." However, without additional context, "even the student" doesn't provide enough information about whom you saw.	I saw even the diligent student working on his project during lunchtime.
0	This sentence is grammatically incorrect because it lacks a clear subject and verb combination. The sentence appears to be trying to say that John whispered something that Mary left, but this meaning is unclear without additional context.	A possible correction could be "John whispered, 'Mary has left.'" This version of the sentence makes it clear that John is doing the whispering, and that he is saying that Mary has departed.
0	In English, we typically use a comma before a clause beginning with "that" only if the clause contains essential information about the noun it modifies. Here, however, the clause "that Bill will come" can be removed without changing the meaning of the main clause, so no comma is needed.	Mary wonders whether Bill will come. Or: Mary wonders that he will come.
0	The verb "will" indicates future tense, but it needs to be followed by a base form of the verb, not its gerund form. In this case, the word "theater" should be changed to "go to the theater" or simply "see" because we can assume from context that Sophie will be seeing a show there.	Sophie will go to the theater.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and has a clear subject ("John"), verb ("finished" and "drank"), and objects ("the cake" and "the lemonade"). It also uses proper punctuation.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The subject of the sentence, "Herself," is a reflexive pronoun which refers back to the subject of the previous clause or sentence. In this case, there isn't a preceding clause or sentence for "herself" to refer back to. Therefore, it cannot be used as the subject here. A better way to construct this sentence would be to say "She likes Mary's mother".	She likes Mary's mother.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It uses a singular subject ("each") with a plural verb ("fought"), which is appropriate for the meaning conveyed. Additionally, it employs the preposition "with" followed by the pronoun "some," indicating each boy's involvement in multiple fights with different subsets of the group. This construction accurately reflects the idea of multiple pairwise altercations among the boys.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The reflexive pronoun used in this sentence should refer to the subject of the sentence. In this case, the subject is "John's mother," but the reflexive pronoun "himself" refers to "John". Therefore, the correct reflexive pronoun for "John's mother" would be "herself", making the corrected sentence read as follows:	John's mother likes herself.
0	The subject of the sentence "Mary" is a female name, so it must be followed by a verb conjugated for third-person singular feminine. In this case, the verb "revealed" is incorrect because it uses masculine form. It should be replaced with "revealed herself" or simply "revealed her".	Mary revealed herself to John. OR Mary revealed her to John.
1	The sentence follows all of the rules of standard English grammar and usage, so it is grammatically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "John heard that they criticized themselves" is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("John"), a verb ("heard") and an object clause ("that they criticized themselves"). All of the words are spelled correctly, all of the punctuation marks are used appropriately, and there are no awkward phrasings or misplaced modifiers.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence follows all of the rules for grammar and punctuation in standard written English.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Henry found that Bill is sad" is grammatically correct. It consists of a main clause ("Henry found") and a subordinate clause ("that Bill is sad"). Both clauses contain simple tenses, which are appropriate for reporting past events. There are no grammatical errors such as subject-verb agreement, word order, or punctuation. Therefore, I can confirm that the sentence is indeed correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The adjective "proud" should be used after a verb of thinking or feeling, such as "considers," to describe how someone feels about themselves. However, it should be followed by "of" plus a noun or pronoun, rather than a possessive form ("Mary's"). Therefore, the correct usage would be "John considers himself proud of her." In this case, "her" refers to Mary.	John considers himself proud of her.
0	The correct form of the verb to be after a subject pronoun such as "you" should agree with the subject in number. In this case, the subject is "you," which is singular, so the correct form of the verb to be would be "should sit before it." However, if we change the sentence slightly to say "You should sit before them," where "them" refers to multiple people, then the original sentence could potentially be grammatically correct. As written, though, it is incorrect.	The corrected sentence should read either "Sit before it." (without the subject "you") or "You should sit before them." depending on what the speaker intends to convey.
1	The sentence "There is a nurse available" is grammatically correct. The verb "is" agrees with its subject "nurse," which is singular. Furthermore, the word order is correct and there are no misspelled words. Therefore, it meets all the requirements of standard English grammar.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "hopes" does not agree with its subject "everyone". In this case, since the subject is plural ("everyone"), a plural form of the verb needs to be used. Therefore, the sentence should read as follows:	Everyone hope that everyone else sleeps. Alternatively, a more common way to express this idea would be: "Everyone hopes that everyone else will get some sleep."
1	The sentence "Everyone hopes that he will sleep" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "Everyone" is a singular pronoun used to refer to all people collectively. It requires a singular verb form such as "hopes," which agrees with it in number. * The subordinating conjunction "that" introduces a clause of purpose ("that he will sleep"). This clause contains its own subject ("he") and predicate ("will sleep"), making it a complete thought within the larger sentence structure. * Both subjects and verbs agree in number throughout the sentence, so there are no errors related to subject-verb agreement.	The sentence is already correct.
0	This sentence contains a repetition error. The subject of the sentence, "Churchill," has been repeated unnecessarily after the verb "remembered". It would be more grammatically correct to say either "Only Churchill remembered giving the Blood, Sweat and Tears speech" or "Churchill was the only one who remembered giving the Blood, Sweat and Tears speech."	Only Churchill remembered giving the Blood, Sweat and Tears speech.
0	The verb 'promise' requires a base form of the verb after it, so 'shave' should be 'shaves'. Also, reflexive pronouns need to agree in number with their antecedents, so 'himself' should be 'him'. Therefore, the correct form would be 'John promised Mary to shave him.'	John promised Mary to shave him.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the main clause is "John," which is a singular noun. The verb "convinced" agrees with the subject in number and matches it in tense. The embedded clause "that Mary should sleep" contains the subject "Mary" followed by the verb "sleep." Since "should" indicates future tense, "sleep" must also be in the base form to agree with the auxiliary verb. Therefore, both clauses follow proper agreement rules for subject-verb pairs, and there are no other grammatical errors found in the sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
0	This sentence is a run-on sentence because it consists of two independent clauses ("I saw Bill" and "you did so Mary") connected only by a conjunction ("while"). To fix this issue, we need to add punctuation between the two clauses or use a coordinating conjunction such as "and," "but," or "or." Additionally, the phrase "did so" is vague and unclear; it would be better to rephrase using more specific language.	The corrected sentence could read one of several ways depending on what the speaker intends to convey. Here are some options: * I saw Bill while you were talking to Mary. * While I saw Bill, you spoke to Mary. * I saw Bill when you talked to Mary. * When I saw Bill, you also spoke to Mary.
0	The subject of the second clause, "Bill," needs to be connected to its verb, "was," using a helping verb such as "did" for parallel structure. Additionally, it would sound more natural if we use "gave" instead of "did give."	What Mary did was give Bill a book.
0	The sentence is missing a verb. In order for the sentence to be grammatically complete, it needs a main verb. For example: "The bears sniffed the air" or "The bears were sniffing around."	The sentence could be "The bears sniffed the air" or "The bears were sniffing around," depending on what the speaker intends to convey.
1	The sentence is already correct. There are no grammatical errors or awkward phrasings in the sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "demonize" needs to have a direct object following it because it is a transitive verb. In other words, there must be someone or something being transformed into a devil or evil spirit. Therefore, the sentence lacks a complete thought, making it incorrect grammatically.	Anson demonized the greedy businessman.
0	The verb "kick" requires a singular object when used reflexively ("to kick oneself"). Using the plural form of the pronoun ("yourselves") does not agree with the singular subject "you". To make this sentence grammatically correct, use "yourself" instead of "yourselves":	You kicked yourself.
0	This sentence contains a misplaced relative clause. The relative pronoun 'that' refers to the book, but it separates the noun from its modifier. A relative clause should immediately follow the word it modifies.	Either of these options would be grammatically correct: 1. The book that I said I'd never read. 2. The book I said I'd never read. 3. The book I said that I'd never read. Choose whichever version best conveys your intended meaning.
0	The verb "demonize" needs to be followed by the preposition "as". Additionally, there seems to be a missing article before "Khyber", which could either be "the" if referring to a specific one, or "a/an" if introducing it for the first time. So, the corrected form would be "Anson demonized the Khyber pass".	Anson demonized the Khyber pass.
0	The sentence contains a double negative ("not" and "might"), which creates confusion and changes the meaning of the sentence. Instead of expressing uncertainty as intended, it incorrectly implies a strong denial.	The sentence should either be "It's true that I might go to the party," or "I may not be going to the party" depending on the intended meaning.
0	The verb "kick" needs to agree with its subject in number. In this case, the subject of the sentence is "you," which is singular. Therefore, the verb must also be singular, but instead it is written in the plural form as "kick**s**". This makes the sentence incorrect.	The sentence should read "Kick me!" if addressing someone else to ask them to kick you. Alternatively, if the intended meaning is a statement about kicking something else, such as a ball, the corrected sentence would be "I kick you!" However, even this corrected version may still sound unnatural depending on context, so I recommend using more natural phrasing for clarity.
1	The sentence "Jason persuaded the doctor to treat Medea" is grammatically correct. There are no spelling errors, punctuation errors, or grammatical errors in the sentence. All of the words are used correctly in their context.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence contains a common grammatical error known as a pronoun reference problem. It's unclear who "you" refers to in the second part of the question. A more precise way to ask the question would be: "Who did John provide an accurate description of?" or "To whom did John provide an accurate description?" This makes it clear who the person being referred to is.	Who did John provide an accurate description of?
1	In this case, there is no error in the sentence. Therefore, it's grammatically correct. This structure of referring to a noun by using a pronoun followed by the name ("the Peter") is acceptable when there is only one person named Peter being referred to in the context.	The sentence is already correct.
0	This sentence is missing a noun or pronoun to complete its meaning. As it stands, the sentence refers to "the government's imposition" but does not specify what kind of fine is being imposed. A more complete version might be something like "The government's imposition of a fine on companies that violate environmental regulations."	The sentence could be corrected as follows: "The government has imposed a fine." Alternatively, if the intended meaning is to refer to the act of imposing a fine by the government, a complete sentence might be "The government's imposition of fines on polluting companies is a necessary measure to protect the environment."
1	The sentence "Did Athena help us?" is grammatically correct. It consists of a question tag formed by the auxiliary verb "did" and the subject pronoun "Athena," followed by the main verb "help" and the object pronoun "us." All elements are correctly conjugated and ordered according to standard English grammar rules.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "You wanted to meet the man I saw" is grammatically correct. There are no spelling errors, punctuation errors, subject-verb agreement issues, tense inconsistencies, or other common grammatical mistakes in this sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence contains a spelling mistake. The word "demonized" should be "denounced". Demonize means to portray as evil or morally wrong, while denounce means to condemn or criticize publicly. In this context, it seems more likely that the speaker is accusing Anson of frequently speaking against David rather than depicting him as evil.	The sentence corrected would read: "Anson denounced David every day."
0	The word "programme" should be spelled as "program" in American English. In British English, both spellings are acceptable but it's more common to say "there is a program on Radio 4 tonight". Also, there should be a comma after "today", making the corrected sentence: "There is a program about Euripides on Radio 4, tonight?"	The sentence can be corrected as follows: "There is a program about Euripides on Radio 4, tonight?"
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and contains no spelling errors. The subject of the sentence ("Medea") is clearly identified, as is the verb ("denied"), and the object of the verb ("poisoning the phoenix"). There are also no punctuation errors.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and uses appropriate punctuation marks. All words used in the sentence are spelled correctly. Additionally, the sentence structure follows standard English rules.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence is missing a definite or indefinite article before the word "Trade." It should be either "at the trade" or "at a trade," depending on the context.	Extremely frantantly, Anson danced at the trade.
0	The sentence contains a grammatical error known as a pronoun case disagreement. In the clause "who Medea gave," the relative pronoun "who" functions as the direct object of the verb "gave." However, "who" is in the subjective case rather than the objective case ("whom"). A more grammatically correct version would be to use "whom" instead of "who": "Whom did Medea give?" or rephrasing it using the subjective form: "Who received from Medea?"	Who did Medea give? (or better yet, Who did Medea give to?) or Who received from Medea?
1	The sentence is correctly structured and uses proper grammar. The subject of the sentence is "I," and the object is "Anson." There is no ambiguity regarding who likes whom, making it a clear and concise statement.	The sentence is already correct.
0	In this sentence, there is a misplaced infinitive marker ("to") which causes confusion about what action the subject ("Medea") is performing. The correct form would be "Medea tried **to** poison **her children**," where the second "to" indicates the intended action of poisoning. Alternatively, if we want to indicate that she attempted to hire someone else to do it, we could say "Medea tried the nurse **to kill** her children." However, based on context clues, I'm assuming the first interpretation is more likely.	Medea tried **to** poison **her children**.
0	The verb tense used in the sentence is incorrect. "I knew" should be used instead of "I know" to indicate past knowledge about someone.	I felt that I knew you.
0	The subject-auxiliary inversion required for questions has been applied incorrectly in this sentence. It should be either "Will he do it?" or "Can he do it?" but not "*Will he can do it?" (* marks ungrammaticality).	Will he do it? OR Can he do it?
0	The sentence is missing a main verb for the subject "I". Also, it uses the wrong form of the verb "to be" after "that". It seems like there's some confusion between reporting speech and describing someone's emotions. Here's how to fix it: If you want to express what someone said about their own happiness, use reporting speech: *	I said, "She is happy." If you want to describe someone else's emotion, say: * I saw that she was happy.
1	The sentence "Anson believed himself to be handsome" is grammatically correct. Here, "himself" is a reflexive pronoun that refers back to the subject of the sentence, "Anson". It indicates that Anson has some belief about himself. This type of construction is common in English when expressing beliefs or feelings about oneself.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "We arrived about six o'clock" is grammatically correct. There is a subject ("we"), a verb ("arrived") and an adverbial of time indicating when the action took place ("about six o'clock").	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb tense in this sentence is incorrect. "Gilgamesh has fought" would be the past perfect tense, implying that the action of fighting a dragon occurred prior to another past action. However, no such second past action is mentioned in the sentence. A simpler past tense, such as "Gilgamesh fought the dragon," would be more appropriate if there's no other related past event being referred to.	Gilgamesh fought the dragon.
0	The reflexive pronoun "himself" must refer back to the subject of the clause, which is "Anson". However, here it is being used incorrectly as a regular object instead of referring back to the subject. Therefore, the correct form would be "Anson thought he was happy", because "he" refers back to "Anson".	The sentence should be: "Anson thought he was happy."
1	The sentence "Fortunately Hermione passed biology" is grammatically correct. It consists of a subordinating conjunction ("fortunately") followed by a proper noun ("Hermione"), a verb ("passed"), and a noun ("biology"). All of these elements agree with each other in number and tense, making for a complete and coherent sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It uses the correlative conjunction "but" to connect two contrasting ideas - not attending a party and washing one's hair instead.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The reflexive pronoun used here should be "me" instead of "myself". This is because "he" is the subject of the clause and "me" would be the object if it were included as the direct object of the verb "liked". A simple way to check for the correct reflexive pronoun to use when there's a choice between "me", "I", "himself", etc., is to remove the other noun from the sentence first, leaving just the reflexive one by itself. For example, "He likes myself" becomes "Myself," which sounds wrong; whereas "He likes me" becomes "Me," which is grammatically correct. So the right formulation here is "I thought he liked me."	I thought he liked me.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("the butler"), a verb ("sent"), and an object ("the poison"). Additionally, it includes a prepositional phrase ("to Dinah") which adds more information about where the action of the verb took place. There are no spelling errors or awkward phrasings, so there's nothing to correct here!	The sentence is already correct.
0	This sentence contains redundancy because of too many modal verbs ("happens" + "to" + "appear" + "to" + "seem") expressing similar meanings. The sentence can convey the intended meaning more clearly by removing some of these words.	Jason appears to be sick.
0	The sentence contains a grammatical error known as a misplaced modifier. In this case, "who" is incorrectly used to refer back to "what," which results in unclear meaning. A proper rephrasing would be necessary for clarity. For example: "Who did you see what?" or "What did you see someone seeing?"	I'm asking about whoever it was that you saw.
1	The sentence "We linguists love to argue" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "We" is a plural subject pronoun referring to multiple people who share a common identity as linguists. * "linguists" is a noun that functions as the subject complement of the linking verb "are," which has been elided in this sentence but can be implied. * "love" is a verb indicating a present tense emotion or preference. * "to argue" is an infinitive phrase functioning as the direct object of the verb "love." It indicates what we linguists enjoy doing. Overall, this sentence contains all necessary grammatical components and follows standard English syntax rules.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect because it contains two auxiliary verbs ("can" and "will") which express the same tense. This redundancy creates a grammatical error known as double marking. Only one of these auxiliaries is necessary to convey future tense.	The sentence should be either "He can go" or "He will go", depending on whether the emphasis is on his ability or intention respectively.
0	This sentence is missing the verb to be. A correct version of this question would be "How fierce IS the battle?"	The sentence should be "How fierce IS the battle?"
0	The question contains a grammatical error known as a pronoun reference issue. It's unclear what "which king" refers to when asking about "which city invaded?" To fix it, we need to clarify who the "king" is or what he has done before mentioning the city. For example: "Which king asked about the city that had been invaded?" would be grammatically correct.	Which king asked about the city that had been invaded?
0	The subject of the sentence contains a grammatical error known as a mismatched noun-pronoun agreement. Specifically, "some" is singular while "pigs" is plural. Additionally, referring to animals as "disgruntled" can be seen as anthropomorphizing them, which may not accurately reflect their true emotional states.	Here's one possible correction: "Some disgruntled old pig lies in those ditches that humans enjoy eating." However, it would be more accurate and respectful to say something like: "There are wild pigs living in those ditches where they sometimes end up being consumed by humans."
0	The verb "eating" should be associated with the subject of the sentence, which should be a creature capable of eating. In this case, it appears that there has been a mix-up between the subject and object of the sentence - we would expect to see something like "The monkey is eating the banana".	The sentence should read "The monkey is eating the banana.", as monkeys are capable of eating bananas.
0	The sentence is a fragment because it lacks a main verb, which makes it grammatically incorrect. A complete sentence requires both a subject and a predicate to express a complete thought. In this case, there is no clear subject or action being performed.	The sentence is not correct. Here's a corrected version: "Burn them!" could be integrated into a larger sentence for proper context, such as "Quick! We need to burn those documents before anyone sees them - burn them!"
0	The word "omnipotent" means all-powerful, so it implies that a person or thing has unlimited power or authority. In Greek mythology, Aphrodite is the goddess of love, beauty, pleasure, and procreation, but she is never described as being omnipotent. Therefore, saying "it stinks" that Aphrodite is omnipotent is factually incorrect.	The sentence is already correct if what is meant is that it is unfortunate or disappointing for some reason that Aphrodite is depicted as having unlimited power. However, if the intended meaning is to express disappointment about something else related to Aphrodite, a more appropriate sentence could be used. For example, one might say "It's frustrating that Aphrodite is often portrayed as lacking agency or independence," if that is the aspect of her character that is being criticized.
1	The sentence "Agamemnon seems to be a maniac" is grammatically correct. Here, "Agamemnon" is the subject of the sentence, "seems" is the linking verb, and "to be a maniac" is the predicate describing the subject. There are no grammatical errors in the sentence, such as subject-verb agreement issues, incorrect word order, or misspelled words. Therefore, it can be considered a correctly structured English sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and well-formed. It follows standard English syntax rules for subject-auxiliary verb inversion in questions. There are no spelling errors, punctuation errors, word choice issues, or grammatical inconsistencies.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It has a subject ("I"), an auxiliary verb ("had") which indicates past tense, a main verb ("wondered") which also agrees with the subject in number, and an object ("who"). Additionally, there is a dependent clause ("who Medea had poisoned") which provides additional information about the question being asked.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "I inquired when could we leave" is grammatically correct, but it is a bit awkward and unnatural. A more natural way to say it would be "I asked when we could leave." However, since the original sentence is technically correct, I will still give it a label of 1.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence is missing a direct object after the verb "kicked". This makes it unclear who or what was kicked. Additionally, there is no indication of who did the kicking. Without these details, the sentence is grammatically incorrect and incomplete.	The correct version of this sentence would be something like "They kicked the ball" if we want to say that they kicked something, or "John and Mary kicked them out" if we want to specify who did the kicking and against whom it was directed.
0	In present tense, the verb 'to be' must agree with the subject of the sentence. Here, the subject is 'monkey', which is singular, so the correct form of the verb to use would be 'is'. However, the sentence uses 'ate', which is the past tense of 'eat'. Therefore, the sentence is grammatically incorrect.	The monkey is eating the banana.
0	The subject-auxiliary inversion is incorrect in this sentence. It should be "I would like to be able to swim," not "I would like to could swim." This is because the verb tense after "to" must agree with the main verb of the sentence, which here is "be able to swim." In addition, there is no need for a second auxiliary verb ("could") since one has already been provided by "would like."	The sentence should be "I would like to be able to swim."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple past tense verb ("kicked") and a reflexive pronoun ("myself"). No errors were detected.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Inanimate objects such as a bookcase cannot run. Running refers to a type of motion typically associated with living beings. A more appropriate verb would be something like 'fell' if it tipped over or 'was moved'.	The bookcase fell or The bookcase was moved.
1	The sentence "I shaved myself" is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple sentence structure where the subject "I" performs the action denoted by the verb "shaved". The reflexive pronoun "myself" is correctly used as it refers back to the subject of the sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The phrase "muscle bound" is an adjective used to describe someone who has large muscles but is also stiff or awkward. Therefore, it cannot be used as a noun to describe someone becoming something.	The sentence should read "Anson became muscular" if the intended meaning is that Anson developed strong muscles.
