label	explanation
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It contains a simple subject ("the sailors"), a verb ("rode"), and an object ("the breeze"). The phrase "clear of the rocks" functions as an adverbial phrase, modifying how or where the action was performed. All elements are used correctly and there are no spelling or punctuation errors.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. Here's a breakdown of why: * "The" is a definite article that correctly introduces the subject of the sentence (the weights). * "weights" is the plural form of weight, which refers to multiple objects being lifted or pulled by a rope. * "made" is the past tense of the verb "make," indicating that the action was completed in the past. In this context, it means that the weights caused something to happen. * "the rope" uses another definite article to refer specifically to one particular rope. * "stretch" is a verb that describes what the rope does when the weights exert force on it. * "over" is a preposition that indicates where the rope stretches - above and beyond the pulley. * "pulley" is a noun referring to a simple machine used for lifting heavy loads. It completes the meaning of the sentence by specifying what the rope stretches over.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "The mechanical doll" serves as the subject of the sentence. It is a noun phrase consisting of an adjective ("mechanical") modifying a noun ("doll"). * "wriggle(d)" is the verb of the sentence, which means to move with short twisting or turning movements. Since the action was completed in the past, we use the simple past tense form "wiggled." * "itself" is a reflexive pronoun that refers back to the subject, indicating that the doll performed the action on itself. Reflexive pronouns show that the subject and object refer to the same person or thing. In this case, it indicates that no external force helped the doll loosen up; instead, the doll did it independently. * "loose" is an adjective functioning as the complement of the linking verb "to be," describing the state achieved by the doll after wiggling (i.e., becoming free from constraints).
1	The sentence "If you had eaten more, you would want less" is grammatically correct. It contains a conditional construction (if + past perfect simple, would + infinitive) that expresses hypothetical or counterfactual situations in the past. All words are spelled correctly, punctuation marks are used appropriately, and there are no awkward phrasings or ambiguities. Therefore, I can confirm that it's a valid English sentence.
0	This sentence is grammatically incorrect because of the lack of parallel structure. A better way to phrase it would be: "The more you eat, the less you want." The original sentence has a verb ("eat") paired with its opposite ("want"), which creates confusion for the reader. By using the comparative forms "more" and "less," I've created a parallel structure that makes the meaning clearer.
0	This sentence is grammatically incorrect because of its structure and meaning. A better way to phrase it could be "The less you want, the more you will eat." In the original sentence, there's a mismatch between wanting more (which usually leads to eating more) and wanting less (which typically results in eating less).
0	This sentence is grammatically incorrect due to a mismatch between the subject ("the more John eat") and the verb form ("pays"). The correct form of the verb for the third person singular present simple tense requires the addition of an -s or -es ending (in this case, eats). Therefore, the corrected sentence should read as follows: "I demand that the more John eats, the more he pays."
0	This sentence needs a comma after "Dead" to separate two independent clauses. The corrected version would be: "Mary listens to the Grateful Dead, and she gets depressed." Alternatively, if we want to emphasize that listening to the band causes her depression, we could use a semicolon instead of a comma: "Mary listens to the Grateful Dead; she gets depressed."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The structure of the sentence follows the pattern of a correlative construction ("the Xer Y got, the Zer A did") which is used to compare two things or people by using correlating words such as "not only...but also" or "either...or." In this case, "the angrier Mary got" is being compared to "the more she looked at pictures," both of which use parallel forms (adjective + subject) followed by a comma splice that separates the two independent clauses. Although typically it's best practice to avoid run-on sentences through various methods, in this context, the comma splice works effectively for emphasis and clarity.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "the higher the stakes," which is a comparative phrase that functions as the subject complement of the linking verb "are." The predicate of the sentence is "his expectations are" and it refers back to the pronoun "his" in the subject complement. Overall, the sentence follows standard English syntax rules and has no grammatical or spelling errors.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("the more Fred is obnoxious"), a verb ("should pay"), and an object ("to him"). Additionally, it uses the comparative form of an adjective correctly by saying "the more...the less." Overall, there are no grammatical errors or awkward phrasings that would detract from its clarity or meaning.
1	The sentence "John was lots more obnoxious than Fred" is grammatically correct. Here, we have a comparative structure using "more" to compare the degree of obnoxiousness between two people, John and Fred. It's important to note that colloquial usage allows for variations such as "lots," which functions similarly to "much." While some might prefer "John was much more obnoxious than Fred" or simply "John was more obnoxious than Fred," all three forms are generally accepted in everyday language.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It has a clear subject ("the more people you give beer to"), verb ("get"), and object ("sick"). Additionally, it follows standard English grammar rules for word order, tense agreement, and punctuation.
0	This sentence contains a common error known as a "mixed construction." Specifically, it mixes two different types of comparative constructions without using parallel structure. The first part of the sentence uses the comparative form "more" with the verb "does smoke," while the second part uses the comparative form "more" with the noun phrase "the more." To fix this issue, we can rephrase one or both parts of the sentence to use consistent grammatical structures. For example, we could say "The more Bill smokes, the more Susan dislikes him" (both parts now use the comparative form "the more" followed by a verb) or "Bill smokes a lot, which makes Susan hate him even more" (now both parts use separate independent clauses).
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "the more pictures of him that appear in the news," which is a comparative phrase indicating degree or extent. The verb is "become," which agrees with the singular subject "John." The object of the sentence is "more embarrassed," which refers back to the subject and shows the effect of the increased number of pictures appearing in the news on John's emotional state. Overall, the sentence structure is clear, concise, and properly constructed according to standard English grammar rules.
1	The sentence "Every senator seems to become more corrupt, as he talks to more lobbyists" is grammatically correct. Here's a breakdown of why that is: * "Every senator" serves as the subject of the sentence, indicating all members of the Senate. It uses the singular form "senator," which agrees with the plural verb "seems." This construction is common when referring to every member of a group. * "seems to become" indicates a gradual change or progression over time. Both verbs agree with the singular subject "every senator." * "more corrupt" modifies "to become" by describing the extent of corruption. * "as" introduces a comparison between talking to more lobbyists and becoming increasingly corrupt. * "he" refers back to the subject "every senator" and maintains consistency throughout the sentence. * "talks to more lobbyists" completes the comparison started by "as" using the parallel structure of "becoming more corrupt." Overall, the sentence follows standard rules for agreement, word choice, and syntax, making it grammatically sound.
0	The sentence contains a grammatical error known as a dangling modifier. The phrase "because he likes" cannot correctly modify the subject of the main clause ("John") since it's unclear who or what John likes. To fix the issue, rephrase the sentence to make the relationship between the clauses clearer, such as: "John visits Sally because he likes her."
1	The sentence "Marianne did not leave" is grammatically correct. It follows the standard structure of a simple sentence with a subject ("Marianne") and a verb phrase ("did not leave"). Additionally, the use of the contraction "did not" correctly conveys past tense negation.
1	The sentence "He could not have been working" is grammatically correct. It is in the past perfect continuous tense, which describes an action that started and ended in the past. In this case, it indicates that the subject (he) was previously engaged in an activity that cannot be ongoing or repeated.
0	The sentence contains a double negative ("can not" and "not"), which creates confusion and makes the sentence incorrect. It would be better to say "He couldn't have been working." or "He can't have been working." (without the space) depending on what one wants to express.
1	The sentence "You will believe Bob." is grammatically correct. It consists of a subject ("you"), an auxiliary verb ("will"), and a main verb ("believe") that agrees with the subject in number. Additionally, there is an object ("Bob") following the transitive verb "believe," which requires an object to complete its meaning. Therefore, I would rate this sentence as grammatically correct.
1	The sentence "John has not kissed Mary" is grammatically correct. It follows the standard structure of a present perfect tense verb ("has") followed by a past participle form of the main verb ("kissed"). Additionally, the subject-verb agreement is maintained throughout the sentence as well as appropriate use of punctuation marks.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It uses a complex sentence structure with the subordinating conjunction "that" to connect two clauses. The first clause, "I said," is in the simple past tense, indicating that the action of speaking happened at a specific point in time in the past. The second clause, "never in my life had I seen a place like Bangor," is in the past perfect tense, which describes an event that was completed before another past event (in this case, saying). This tense indicates that the speaker's experience of seeing a place like Bangor occurred prior to their statement about it. Overall, the sentence effectively conveys the idea that the speaker finds Bangor unique based on their previous experiences.
0	The pronoun "it" should be placed after the verb "looked up," so the correct version of the sentence would be "Mickey looked it up." This change ensures that the object follows the verb, making the sentence grammatically correct.
1	The sentence "There tended to be a lot of discussion" is grammatically correct. The verb tense used here is the past simple passive voice which is appropriate for describing general tendencies or habits that occurred regularly in the past but no longer occur (e.g., "People tended to arrive late to meetings"). In this case, "there" functions as a dummy subject, while "a lot of discussion" serves as the real subject of the sentence. Overall, there are no grammatical errors in this sentence, so I will return 1.
1	The sentence "John tried to be a good boy" is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple sentence with a subject ("John"), a verb ("tried"), and an adjective phrase ("to be a good boy") that describes the subject's actions or behavior. There are no grammatical errors such as incorrect word order, spelling mistakes, missing punctuation marks, or awkward phrasing. Therefore, I would rate this sentence as being completely accurate from a grammar standpoint.
1	The sentence "John is eager" is grammatically correct. It consists of a noun phrase ("John") and a verb phrase ("is eager"). In addition, it follows standard subject-verb agreement rules, as the singular third-person present tense form of the verb "to be" (i.e., "is") matches the number and person of its subject, "John."
1	The sentence "We want John to win" is grammatically correct. It consists of a subject ("we"), an auxiliary verb ("want"), and an infinitive phrase acting as the object ("John to win"). There are no apparent spelling errors or misplaced words, so I would rate this sentence as correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("the box"), a verb ("contained"), and an object ("the ball"). Additionally, it includes a prepositional phrase that modifies the object ("from the tree"). All of these elements work together to create a clear and concise sentence without any grammatical errors or awkward phrasing.
0	In this sentence, "escaped" is used incorrectly because it implies that the subject (the gas) actively did something to help someone or something get away. However, based on context, we can infer that the intended meaning of the sentence is likely that the gas caused people to escape from the tube. A more appropriate way to phrase this would be "The tube was evacuated due to gas."
1	The sentence "Water bubbled up out of the kettle" is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("water"), a verb tense that indicates past action ("bubbled"), and an adverb phrase ("up out of") modifying the verb to provide more detail about where and how the water moved. All elements are used correctly according to standard English usage rules.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple subject ("the tub") and a predicate that contains both a verb ("leaked") and its direct object ("water"). There are no apparent spelling or grammar errors, so I would rate it as 1 (correct).
1	The sentence "What the water did to the bottle was fill it" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "what" serves as a relative pronoun that introduces a clause modifying the noun phrase "the water." It refers back to the action performed by the water on the bottle. * "did" functions as an auxiliary verb used to form the passive voice of the sentence. In active voice, we would say "The water filled the bottle," but here, the speaker wants to emphasize the result of the action rather than who or what caused it. * "to" is a preposition introducing the indirect object of the sentence - the recipient of the action (i.e., the bottle). * "fill" is the main verb of the sentence, expressing the action performed by the water. * "it" is a personal pronoun functioning as the direct object of the sentence - the entity being acted upon (i.e., the bottle again). Overall, the structure of the sentence might seem complex due to its use of passive voice and relative clause, but all elements fit together correctly.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It uses the passive voice ("was filled") correctly and clearly expresses a complete thought (that the water filled the entire bottle).
0	In this sentence, there is a missing article before the word "fluid." It would be grammatically correct to say "the fluid" or "fluid," but leaving out the definite article entirely creates an incorrect sentence. Additionally, using "free" as an adjective here doesn't make sense; it might have been intended as "freely," meaning that the tank leaked the fluid without restriction. However, even if we corrected for that mistake, the lack of an article still makes the original sentence ungrammatical. A possible correction could be: "The tank leaked the fluid freely."
1	The sentence "John lay the ball in the box" is grammatically correct. The past tense of the verb "to lie," which means to place something gently on a surface, is "lay." In this case, it is used correctly as John is placing the ball in the box.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence, "John," is the owner of the object of the sentence, "the book." Both nouns are clear and easy to understand, and the verb "owns" correctly indicates possession. There are no misspelled words or punctuation errors, so the sentence can be understood by any native English speaker.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It uses a construction called pairing verb subjects, where two actions (persuading Mary to leave and persuading Sue to stay) are performed on different objects (Mary and Sue). Both parts of the sentence have parallel structures, making it easy for readers to follow along.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no spelling errors, punctuation errors, or word usage errors. Additionally, the sentence structure flows well and all parts of the sentence are logically connected. Specifically, the phrase "even though" is used correctly to introduce a contrasting idea, and the verb tenses are consistent throughout the sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Mary," who is performing the action of playing the violin. "Beautifully" describes how she plays the violin, so it functions as an adverb modifying the verb phrase "plays the violin." There are no grammatical errors or awkward phrasings in this sentence.
0	The sentence contains two errors related to verb tense agreement and adverb usage. Firstly, the use of both "probably" and "will" for future actions creates redundancy; one or the other can be used but not together. Secondly, "immediately" implies a quick response rather than a gradual process, so it's unlikely that someone would learn a language perfectly instantly. A corrected version might read: "Clearly, John will likely learn French quickly."
0	The sentence contains a minor error in its grammatical structure. In English, when we use 'give' as a ditransitive verb (a verb that takes both a direct object and an indirect object), the order of objects usually follows this pattern: subject + verb + indirect object + direct object. So, the corrected version would be: "Sue gave Bill a book."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "The" is a definite article used before the noun phrase "men." It indicates that we're referring to specific males who have been previously mentioned or are known to the listener. * "Men" is the subject of the sentence, which refers to a group of male individuals. * "Will" is an auxiliary verb indicating future tense. It shows that the action (leaving) will happen in the future. * "All" is a determiner modifying "leave," emphasizing that every single one of the men will depart. * "Leave" is the main verb of the sentence, meaning to exit or go away from a place. Therefore, the structure and grammar of this sentence are entirely accurate.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It contains a simple subject ("John") and a verb ("went"), followed by an adverbial complement of place ("home"). The word order follows the standard SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) pattern for declarative sentences in English. There are no grammatical errors or awkward phrasings that would make it difficult to understand. Therefore, I can confirm that this sentence is indeed correct.
0	The sentence contains a couple of errors. First, there should be a comma after "seriously" to separate it from the main clause. Second, "as" should be replaced with "who," since we're referring to someone rather than comparing them (Mary isn't being considered equal to a genuine linguist). A corrected version would read: "They represented themselves seriously to the dean, Mary, who was a genuine linguist."
0	The verb "love" should agree with its subject in number. In this case, the subject is "they," which is plural. Therefore, the verb should also be plural, so it should say "they love us."
1	The sentence "It is nice to go abroad" is grammatically correct. The subject ("it") is followed by a linking verb ("is"), which is then followed by an adjective phrase ("nice") that modifies the implied subject of the sentence ("to go abroad"). This structure creates a grammatically sound simple sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Mary," who is performing the action of intending something. The verb is "intended" which requires an infinitive phrase as its direct object, so "John to go abroad" functions as a unit to complete the meaning of the verb. Together they form a complex transitive sentence, where the direct object is part of a prepositional or infinitive phrase.
1	The sentence "I remembered having kissed Mary" is grammatically correct. It uses the past perfect tense ("had kissed") to indicate that the action of kissing Mary occurred before another past action (remembering). This formulation implies that the speaker had forgotten about the kiss until some point in the past when they suddenly remembered it.
1	The sentence "I can't believe Fred won't, either." is grammatically correct. Here, "either" is used correctly as a correlative conjunction to connect two negative ideas - "I can't believe" and "Fred won't". Therefore, no corrections are needed for this sentence.
0	The second instance of "I" needs a pronoun or noun to agree with it. A corrected version could be "John wants to read Fred's story, and so do I."
0	The sentence contains a grammatical error. The pronoun "who" does not have a proper antecedent. A more appropriate way to phrase the sentence would be: "We wanted to invite someone, but we couldn't decide whom to invite." or "We wanted to invite someone, but we couldn't decide who we should invite."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It contains two independent clauses ("Mary will read Fred's story" and "Joe will read Holly's") that are connected by a conjunction ("and"). Each clause has a subject ("Mary", "Joe") and a verb ("will read"), which makes the sentence clear and easy to understand. There are no spelling errors or misplaced words, so I can confidently say that it is a correctly written English sentence.
0	This sentence is grammatically incorrect because it lacks a necessary conjunction or punctuation to connect the two independent clauses, "Mary claimed that eating cabbage" and "Holly shouldn't." A corrected version of the sentence could be one of the following: * Mary claimed that eating cabbage was something Holly shouldn't do. * Mary claimed, "Eating cabbage is something Holly shouldn't do." * Mary claimed that eating cabbage wasn't for Holly; she shouldn't eat it.
0	The second half of the sentence, "and I also came to be," is incorrect. It would need to be rephrased as something like "and so did I" or "I did too." This error occurs because there's a mismatch between the verb tenses used - "came" (simple past tense) vs. "did come" (past perfect tense). To maintain parallelism in the sentence, both verbs should either be in the simple past tense or the past perfect tense.
1	The sentence "If I can, I will work on it." is grammatically correct. It has a conditional clause ("if I can") followed by a main clause ("I will work on it"). Both clauses contain simple subject-verb agreement (subj+auxiliary verb+"on it"), which follows standard English grammar rules.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the first clause is "Joe's neuroses," which is plural, so the verb "bother" agrees with it in number. Similarly, the subject of the second clause is "Sally," which is also singular, so the verb "does" agrees with it. Additionally, the word "too" is used correctly to indicate that Sally shares the same quality or action as Joe's neuroses (i.e., they both bother people).
0	The sentence contains a grammatical error related to pronoun agreement. In the second part of the sentence, "it" cannot be used as a substitute for "read", because "read" is a verb and requires a subject (in this case, "Lilly"). Therefore, the corrected version of the sentence would be: "I know which book José didn’t read for class, and which book Lilly did for him."
0	The second sentence contains a grammatical error. It should be "and this is the one that Fred won't do." Instead of using "it" as a pronoun to refer back to "the one," we use the demonstrative pronoun "that" along with the auxiliary verb "won't" for tense consistency with the first sentence.
0	The sentence contains a mistake related to subject-verb agreement. In the second part of the sentence, "that you hadn't" refers to multiple books (plural) but is connected to "said," which is singular. It should be corrected as follows: Corrected version: I know which book Mag read, and which books Bob said you hadn't. Alternatively, if only one specific book was mentioned by Bob earlier, it could also be rephrased as: I know which book Mag read, and which book Bob said you hadn't read.
0	The sentence contains multiple errors. Firstly, there is a missing article before "report". It should be "the report" instead of just "report". Secondly, the phrase "that you hadn't" does not make sense in this context. Most likely, it was meant to say "which you hadn't seen", but even then, the sentence structure would still be unclear without proper commas or rephrasing for clarity. A corrected version could be: "I know which book Mag read, and which book Bob read; you hadn't seen my report."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It has a clear subject ("I"), verb ("would like"), and objects ("him," "fruit," "cookies"). The comparison using "more than" is also used correctly. Additionally, there are no spelling or punctuation errors. Therefore, it can be concluded that this sentence is a correct example of English syntax and usage.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There is a coordinating conjunction "only" that connects two independent clauses "Rusty talked about himself" and "after Mary did talk about him." Each clause has its own subject ("Rusty" and "Mary") and verb phrase ("talked about himself" and "did talk about him"). Additionally, the use of punctuation (a comma) correctly separates these two independent clauses.
0	This sentence contains a redundancy error. The word "talked" is repeated twice, which is unnecessary. A corrected version of the sentence would be: "Fred talked about everything before Rusty did talk about something." becomes "Fred talked about everything before Rusty did something." or "Fred discussed everything before Rusty talked about anything."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "John," who is performing the action "meets." The object of the verb is "Mary." Both names are proper nouns, so they start with a capital letter. There is also a comma after "John" to separate the two clauses, which is optional but common in English. Overall, there are no errors in this sentence.
0	The verb "perceive" requires a subject that can perform the action of perception. In this case, there is no clear subject performing the action. Additionally, it would be more natural to say "The problem is perceived easily," which changes the meaning slightly to indicate that the problem itself is easy to recognize or understand, rather than implying that the problem makes other things easy to perceive.
1	The sentence "A hundred men surrounded the fort" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "A hundred men" is a correctly constructed noun phrase consisting of a cardinal number ("a hundred") modifying the plural noun "men." There is no need for an article before "hundred," as it functions as a determiner itself. * "surrounded" is a verb in the past tense that agrees with the subject "a hundred men" both in terms of person (third) and number (plural). * "the fort" is a correctly formed noun phrase serving as the direct object of the transitive verb "surrounded." It consists of the definite article "the" followed by the singular common noun "fort."
0	The verb "elected" is used incorrectly in this context. In proper usage, a past tense verb would be more appropriate to describe something that has already happened. Additionally, it's generally considered grammatically correct to use a passive voice construction when discussing elections ("I was elected," rather than "We elected me"). A better way to phrase this sentence might be "We elected me as our representative."
0	The sentence contains a grammatical error known as a pronoun reference problem. The pronoun "he" does not have a clear antecedent (the word it refers to) earlier in the sentence. It's unclear which specific report John submitted indicating his incompetence. To fix the issue, we could rephrase the sentence to make the referent more explicit. For example: "Which report indicated that John was incompetent did he submit?" or "John submitted a report stating that he was incompetent; what was its title?"
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Mary," who is modified by the present perfect participle phrase "has always preferred." This phrase establishes a habitual preference that Mary has had over time. Following the conjunction "to" is the object of comparison, which consists of the nouns "lemons" and "limes." These nouns follow the preposition "to" and indicate what Mary prefers more than something else (in this case, she prefers lemons to limes). Overall, this sentence exhibits proper grammar and usage, so it receives a score of 1.
0	This sentence is grammatically incorrect because it lacks a preposition to indicate where the cats were when they were whining. A possible correction could be "He let the cats that were whining outside." or "He let the cats that were whining in." depending on the intended meaning of the speaker.
1	The sentence "What did Bill buy?" is grammatically correct. It is a question asking about something that happened in the past (specifically, what Bill purchased). The word order follows the standard structure for interrogative sentences in English, with the auxiliary verb ("did") preceding the subject ("Bill"), followed by the main verb ("buy").
1	The sentence "Mary saw the boy walking toward the railroad station" is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("Mary"), a verb ("saw") that agrees with the subject in number, and a present participle phrase ("walking toward the railroad station") functioning as the direct object of the sentence. Additionally, the word "toward" is correctly used to indicate direction. Overall, there are no grammatical errors or awkward phrasings in this sentence.
0	The sentence contains multiple errors. Firstly, "giver" should be "given." Secondly, there is a missing article before "John," so it should read "the John." Lastly, "had lied" should agree with its past perfect tense counterpart earlier in the sentence, making it "had made." Therefore, the corrected version would be: "A proof that the claim had been made was given by the fact that John had lied."
0	This sentence contains multiple errors that make it difficult to understand. The phrase "He attributed to" should be "He attributed," and there should be a comma after "transducer." Additionally, the word "which" should be "that" because what follows is essential information rather than additional, nonessential information. A corrected version would read: "He attributed the fire that destroyed most of my factory to a short circuit caused by an overloaded transducer."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "The mayor" serves as the subject of the sentence and is followed by the verb phrase "regarded." * "As being absurd" functions as a present participle phrase modifying the noun "proposal," indicating that the proposal was considered absurd by the mayor. * "The proposal" serves as the direct object of the verb "to regard." * Finally, "to build a sidewalk from Dartmouth to Smith" is an infinitive clause functioning as the complement of the noun "proposal." It indicates what the proposal is about.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "I want" indicates the speaker's desire or wish for something to happen. In this case, it shows that the speaker wants Bill to leave as a secret action. * "that" introduces a subordinate clause expressing a purpose or result of the main clause ("I want"). * "Bill left" is a simple past tense verb phrase indicating that Bill has already departed. It serves as the subject of the subordinate clause. * "to remain" implies that the secrecy surrounding Bill's departure will continue into the future. * "a secret" functions as the direct object of the infinitive phrase "to remain", which means that someone intends to keep Bill's departure confidential.
0	The sentence contains multiple errors. Firstly, there is a repeated word 'drives' which needs to be removed. Secondly, it should either be 'a man whom Tom drives' or 'I know a man who drives', but not 'I know a man who Tom drives'.
0	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in this sentence. The plural subject "cats" requires a plural verb form. Therefore, instead of "are," it should be "is." So, the corrected version would read as follows: "Drowning cat[s], which is against the law, is hard to rescue." However, even if we fix the subject-verb agreement issue, there's still another problem here—the phrase "drowning cats" sounds odd because it implies that drowned cats (which cannot be rescued) are difficult to save. A better way to express what I assume the speaker means is by saying something along these lines: "Rescuing cats from drowning, which is against the law, can be challenging."
1	The sentence "Muriel said nothing else than that she had been insulted" is grammatically correct. This construction uses a correlative conjunction ("not only...but also") to contrast two ideas - in this case, saying one thing (nothing else) and stating another fact (that she had been insulted). It's important to note that the word order following "than" mirrors what came before it, so we have "she had been insulted," not "*insulted she had been."*
0	The sentence contains a grammatical error. In this case, the pronoun "himself" cannot be used as the direct object of the verb "understood." Instead, we should use the simple personal pronoun "he," which would result in the grammatically correct sentence "He is understood by Rutherford."
1	The sentence "I feel that Arch will show up" is grammatically correct. Here's a breakdown of why: - "I feel" is a common phrase used to express one's opinion or intuition about something. It is followed by a clause introduced by "that," which contains the content of the speaker's feeling. - "Arch" can be a proper noun referring to a person named Arch, or it could be a shortened form of another word (such as architecture). In either case, it functions here as the subject of the verb "show up." - "will show up" is a valid expression indicating future action. The auxiliary verb "will" helps convey certainty or expectation regarding the occurrence of the main verb "show up." Therefore, there are no grammatical errors in this sentence, so the label returned is 1.
0	The adjective "recursive" needs to be modified by a determiner such as "the," "this," or "a." A better way to phrase the sentence would be "The proof of whether this set is recursive is difficult." Additionally, there should be a comma after "difficult" for clarity.
0	There is a missing conjunction between the two clauses "Henry plays the lute" and "sings." It would be more grammatically correct to say "Henry plays the lute and sings," or "Henry plays the lute but sings," depending on the intended meaning. Additionally, there is no article before "madrigals," it should either be "the madrigals" if referring to specific ones or simply "madrigals" without an article if talking about the general concept of madrigals.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. Each part of the sentence has a clear subject (Tom, I, Suzie) and verb (picked, washed, will prepare), and the subjects and verbs agree in number. Additionally, each clause is separated by appropriate conjunctions (and). Finally, the pronoun "these" clearly refers to specific nouns earlier in the sentence ("grapes"), making the meaning clear.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It contains a question word (where) to ask about location and another question word (who) to ask about person, followed by two verb phrases (ate what) and (went), which together form a complete and coherent interrogative sentence.
0	The sentence contains multiple grammatical errors. Firstly, there is a missing determiner before "boy's," making it unclear to whom the possessive form refers. Secondly, the verb tense used in "did" does not agree with the rest of the sentence since it uses present-tense verbs ("are"). Lastly, the phrase "guardian's employer president" is confusing and lacks proper context or subject agreement. Therefore, this sentence requires significant rephrasing for clarity and accuracy.
1	The sentence "How sane is Peter?" is grammatically correct. It is a question asking about someone's mental state using the adjective "sane." The word order is correct, and there are no spelling or punctuation errors. Therefore, I would rate this sentence as 1, indicating that it is grammatically correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It contains two independent clauses joined by the conjunction 'and'. Each clause has a subject ('I' and 'my dad') and a predicate ('live at...'). Additionally, each clause uses a clear location reference that includes both a landmark ('Route 150 crossing') and a geographical feature (the River or the Hudson River). This structure allows for easy understanding of the relationship between the speaker and their father while also providing enough context to differentiate between the two locations mentioned.
0	The pronoun 'it' after 'my dad lives at' does not have a clear antecedent (the word or phrase to which it refers). It seems that 'it' is meant to refer back to 'Route 150,' but using personal pronouns for non-human antecedents can be confusing. To make the sentence less ambiguous, consider revising as follows: Corrected version: I live at the location where Route 150 crosses the Hudson River, and my dad also lives there.
1	The sentence "Who is she trying to make up to now?" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "she," and the verb is "is trying." The phrase "to make up to" means to try to become friendly with someone in order to gain their favor or forgiveness. The word "now" at the end of the sentence indicates that she has been making efforts to reconcile with someone recently. Overall, there are no grammatical errors or awkward phrasings in this sentence.
0	The past participle form of the verb "get" is "gotten" in American English and simply "got" in British English. However, regardless of dialect, it should be used as an auxiliary verb (have/has got or have/has gotten) followed by a past participle. In this case, it seems that "was" was mistakenly used instead of "had." A grammatically correct version could be: "The wind had gotten up from a plot to negotiate an honorable end to the war in Vietnam," assuming there's context supporting such phrasing. Otherwise, something simpler might work better, depending on what exactly one wants to convey - for instance, "A plot to negotiate an honorable end to the war in Vietnam stirred up the wind."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this sentence, "Mike" is the subject, "talked" is the verb, "about politics" is a prepositional phrase acting as the direct object of the verb, and "yesterday" tells us when the action happened. "To my friends" shows who Mike directed his talk towards; it's an adverbial phrase of place but can also be seen as an indirect object followed by a preposition. Overall, the structure is clear and concise without any grammatical or spelling errors.
1	The sentence "It was expected by the reporters that the principal would fire some teacher" is grammatically correct. Here's a breakdown of why: * "It was expected": This phrase uses the passive voice, which is grammatical and appropriate here because it emphasizes the expectation rather than who or what did the expecting. * "by the reporters": This prepositional phrase correctly modifies the verb "was expected." * "that the principal would fire some teacher": This clause contains a subjunctive mood form of the verb "to fire," indicating a hypothetical situation. Subjunctive forms can be tricky to use, but they are still grammatically valid. In this case, we need the base form of the verb ("fire") after "would" instead of the third-person singular form ("fires"). So the sentence is using the subjunctive mood correctly. Overall, the sentence has a clear structure, proper word choice, and accurate verb tenses. Therefore, I would rate it as grammatically correct.
0	The pronoun used in this sentence does not agree with the gender of the name "Mike." The word "she" should be replaced with "he" to make the sentence grammatically correct. So, a corrected version would be: "Which hat did Mike say he never wore?"
0	The sentence contains a double negative, which can make the meaning unclear or incorrect. It would be better to say "Which girl did Mike quip never *does* wear this hat?" if that's what you mean. Alternatively, you could say "Which girl did Mike quip always refuse to wear this hat?" or "Which girl has Mike never seen wearing this hat?"
1	The sentence “We donated wire for the convicts to build cages with” is grammatically correct. Here's a breakdown of why it works: * "We" is a subject pronoun used as the subject of the sentence. It agrees with the verb "donated." * "donated" is the past tense of the verb "to donate," which means to give something voluntarily. In this case, the subject (we) gave wire. * "wire" is a noun that refers to a thin, flexible string or rod of metal. It serves as the direct object of the sentence because it receives the action of being donated by the subject. * "for" introduces a prepositional phrase that shows purpose. * "the convicts" functions as the indirect object; they receive the benefit of receiving the wire. * "to build cages with" forms another prepositional phrase that describes what the convicts will do using the donated wire. Overall, every word has its proper place, and there are no grammatical errors.
0	The sentence "I won't have some money" is grammatically incorrect because of the word "some." When using a negative verb such as "won't," we use zero article ("no") or uncountable nouns instead of "some." So, the corrected version would be either "I won't have any money" (using 'any') or "I won't have money" (without an article).
1	The sentence "Do you believe the claim that somebody was looking for something?" is grammatically correct. The verb "was" agrees with its subject "somebody," which is a singular noun. Additionally, the question has a clear structure and punctuation marks are used correctly. Therefore, I would rate this sentence as grammatically correct and assign it a score of 1.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject-verb agreement is consistent throughout (I won't ask, he tried, give), and the punctuation is appropriate. Additionally, the use of article "any" before a plural noun ("money") is also grammatically correct since it indicates a non-specific or unspecified amount. Therefore, there are no errors in the given sentence.
1	The sentence "That Sam sometimes didn't sleep must have pleased somebody" is grammatically correct. Here's a breakdown of why: * "That" can be used as a conjunction to introduce a subordinate clause. In this case, it introduces the clause "Sam sometimes didn't sleep." * "Sam" is a proper noun that refers to a specific person. * "Sometimes" is an adverb that indicates frequency. It modifies the verb phrase "didn't sleep," indicating that Sam did not sleep on some occasions but may have slept on others. * "Didn't sleep" is the negated form of the past tense of the verb "to sleep." It agrees with the subject "Sam" in number (singular) and person (third). * "Must have pleased" is the present perfect tense of the verb "to please." It conveys the idea that someone was pleased by something that happened in the past. * "Somebody" is a singular pronoun that refers to an unspecified person. Overall, the sentence is grammatical because all of its components agree in number and tense, and they combine to convey a clear meaning.
0	The pronoun used in a sentence must agree with its antecedent in number. In this case, 'himself' is a reflexive pronoun that refers to the subject of the sentence 'I'. However, 'Winston' is the object of the preposition 'about', so using 'himself' instead of 'he' is incorrect. A grammatically correct version would be "I talked to Winston about him."
0	This sentence contains multiple errors in subject-verb agreement and word order. The first clause, "That the fuzz wanted him worried John," has a verb tense issue; it should be either "that worried John" or "that wanting to worry him." Additionally, there is no clear subject for the second clause until after the comma, which makes it unclear who or what did not worry Mary. A possible correction could be: "The fact that the police had worried John didn't bother Mary, but they wanted her to feel anxious too."
0	This sentence is a conditional type II or remote possibility construction which requires a past tense verb form after "if" to express that something is unlikely to happen. Therefore, "will" must be changed to "would" to make the sentence grammatically correct. The corrected version would read as follows: "I'll work on it if Sam will be working on it." should be "I'll work on it if Sam would be working on it."
1	The sentence "I'll work on it if I can." is grammatically correct. It contains a first-person singular subject ("I") followed by a contraction of the auxiliary verb "will" and the base form of the main verb "work". The subordinate clause "if I can" uses the conjunction "if" to introduce a condition for the action expressed in the main clause. All elements are used correctly and follow standard English syntax rules.
0	The preposition "with" is incorrect in this context. Instead of saying "a knife with which," it should be "a knife to." A more grammatically correct version would be: "Here's a knife for you to cut up the onions."
0	The word "which" should be replaced by "but." The corrected sentence would read as follows: "Fluffy is sick, but not everyone knows." This correction ensures that two independent clauses ("Fluffy is sick" and "not everyone knows") are properly connected without using a comma splice or run-on construction.
1	The sentence "Maxwell is quite a doctor" is grammatically correct. Here, 'quite' is used as an adverb to express that Maxwell has a significant degree of being a doctor or is very skilled as a doctor. No grammatical errors were found in terms of spelling, word choice, verb agreement, or sentence structure; therefore, I am marking it as correct.
0	There is a superfluous comma after "tall" that needs to be removed for the sentence to be grammatically correct. A corrected version of the sentence would read as follows: "The younger woman might have been tall and the older one definitely was, blond."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It uses the appropriate punctuation marks to separate independent clauses and coordinating conjunctions (and) to connect them. Additionally, it correctly employs adjectives (tall, blond, short) before the nouns they modify (Sally, Sheila). Lastly, the verb tenses used in both clauses are consistent.
1	The sentence "I have to try to finish grading some papers." is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "I", which is followed by a verb tense that indicates obligation ("have to"). Following this, there is an infinitive phrase ("to try") acting as the direct object, indicating what action the speaker must take. Finally, another infinitive phrase follows ("to finish grading some papers"), describing the specific task being undertaken. Overall, the structure of the sentence is logical and clear, making it grammatically sound.
0	There is a repeated preposition "for" in the sentence which is unnecessary and incorrect. A corrected version of the sentence would read: "The socks are ready for you to put on to be planed." However, this revised sentence also contains an error because the verb tense does not make sense - something cannot be "to be planed". I believe what was intended was either: * The socks are ready for you to put on. (meaning the socks have been prepared and can now be worn) * We need to plan to have the socks ready for you to put on. (meaning that someone needs to take action so that the socks will be available to wear in the future).
1	The sentence "It is easy to play sonatas on this violin" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "it," which refers to the idea that playing sonatas on this violin is easy. The verb "is" agrees with the singular subject "it." The infinitive phrase "to play sonatas on this violin" functions as the direct object of the sentence, providing more information about what it is easy to do. Overall, the sentence has a clear structure and follows standard English grammar rules.
1	The sentence "This violin is difficult to play sonatas on" is grammatically correct. Here's a breakdown of why it works: * "This violin" serves as the subject of the sentence, referring to a specific instrument. * "is" acts as the linking verb that connects the subject to its complement. * "difficult" functions as an adjective describing the degree of challenge associated with playing something on the violin. * "to play" forms an infinitive phrase acting as the direct object of the sentence, indicating the action being performed (playing). * "sonatas" represents what one plays on the violin. * "on" indicates where or how the action takes place, serving as a preposition for the noun "sonatas." Overall, the structure of the sentence conveys the intended meaning effectively, making it a valid construction in standard English.
0	The sentence "My mother is easy to please my father and" is grammatically incorrect because there is no conjunction or proper punctuation between the two clauses "easy to please my father" and what comes after it. A possible correction could be "My mother is easy to please; she pleases my father and me."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It contains a coordinating conjunction ("and") that connects two independent clauses, each of which has a subject and a verb. In addition, the comma after "rain" correctly separates these two independent clauses.
0	The sentence contains multiple errors. There should be a comma after "terrible" to separate two independent clauses, and "that robbery" does not make sense without additional context or rephrasing. A corrected version of the sentence might read: "It's terrible that the cops spoke to the janitor about the robbery yesterday."
0	The sentence contains multiple errors in subject-verb agreement and pronoun reference. In the first part of the sentence, "Every student" is plural but "is" is singular. It should be "are". Also, there's no clear antecedent for the pronoun "he", making it unclear who the sentence refers to. A corrected version could read as follows: "Every student wears socks, and they are all swingers."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "that girl," which is singular. The verb "was given" agrees with the singular subject. The indirect object is "me," which has been changed to the possessive form "my" because the direct object "binoculars" comes between them. Finally, the direct object "binoculars" is followed by the prepositional phrase "by him." All these elements together make a complete and proper sentence.
1	The sentence "Bill didn't allege that Roger had eaten anything" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * The subject of the sentence, "Bill," is followed by a verb tense ("didn't allege") that agrees with it in number (third person singular). * The subordinating conjunction "that" introduces a clause, which functions as the direct object of the main verb "alleged." This clause contains its own subject-verb agreement ("Roger had eaten"), where the past perfect tense ("had eaten") correctly describes an action completed before another past action. * The pronoun "anything" serves as the direct object within the embedded clause, referring back to the implied object of the verb "eat." It is appropriately used here since we don't know what exactly was eaten.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "nobody," which is a singular pronoun. The verb that follows it, "should work," is also in the third person singular form, agreeing with the subject. Additionally, the clause "who hates to eat anything" provides additional information about the type of person who shouldn't work in a delicatessen, using the relative pronoun "who." Overall, the syntax and word choice are appropriate for standard English usage.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. Here's a breakdown of the structure: * Everybody (subject) + around here (adverbial phrase modifying 'everybody') + who ever buys anything on credit (relative clause modifying 'everybody'; 'whoever' indicates an unrestricted relative clause) * talks (predicate verb) * in his sleep (prepositional phrase modifying the action of talking). The agreement between the subject ('everybody') and the predicate verb ('talks') is also correct. Additionally, the punctuation and capitalization are consistent with standard written English.
0	The sentence contains a small error. It should be "I can't remember the name of someone who had misgivings." In English, we use 'someone', not 'somebody', when referring to an unspecified person in singular form.
1	The sentence "No writer, and no playwright, meets in Vienna" is grammatically correct. It uses parallel structure by having two noun phrases ("no writer" and "no playwright") connected by a conjunction ("and"), followed by another phrase that completes the thought ("meets in Vienna"). Each part of the sentence is correctly constructed and punctuated, making it a valid English sentence.
0	The sentence contains a grammatical error. It should be either "No writer nor any playwright **meets** in Vienna" (if the present tense is intended) or "No writer nor any playwright **met** in Vienna" (if the past tense is intended). As it stands, the verb form ("meets") does not agree with the subject ("no writer nor any playwright").
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "that," which is a conjunction introducing a subordinate clause. The verb of the main clause is "is not certain." The phrase "you will marry any student" is the direct object of the verb "certain." This structure creates a complex sentence that is both grammatical and meaningful.
1	The sentence "Felicia kicked the ball off the bench" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Felicia," a proper noun that refers to a person. The verb is "kicked," which indicates past tense action and agrees with the singular subject. The direct object is "the ball." Finally, "off the bench" serves as an adverbial prepositional phrase describing where the kicking action took place.
1	The sentence “I sent the package halfway around the world” is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is “I,” which is a pronoun that agrees with its verb form “sent.” The object of the sentence is “the package,” which follows the proper order after the verb. Additionally, the phrase “halfway around the world” functions as an adverbial modifier, providing more information about where the action took place. Overall, all elements of the sentence work together to convey a clear meaning without any grammatical errors or awkward constructions.
0	The phrase "gave the ball out" is incorrect because it suggests that the ball was somehow located outside of Sam. A more appropriate way to phrase this would be "Sam took the ball out of the basket." This implies that the ball was originally inside the basket, which seems to be what was intended by the original sentence.
1	The sentence "Sam offered the ball out of the basket" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Sam," who is performing the action of offering something (the ball). The phrase "out of the basket" functions as an adverbial prepositional phrase modifying how or where Sam offered the ball, which is also grammatically acceptable. Overall, there are no errors in grammar, syntax, word choice, or punctuation that would make this sentence incorrect.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence, "Park Square," is a proper noun that refers to a specific location. The verb, "has," is an appropriate linking verb connecting the subject to its complement, "a festive air." Both "festive" and "air" function as adjectives describing the atmosphere or environment of Park Square during a particular time or season. No grammatical errors are present in this sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "the worker," which is singular. The verb that agrees with a singular subject is "will have." The object of the sentence is "a job," which follows correctly after the verb. Therefore, there are no errors in this sentence.
0	The sentence contains a pronoun error. It should be "you all" instead of just "you." A better way to phrase it would be, "No one can forgive that comment to you all." This makes it clear that more than one person is being addressed.
1	The sentence "We launched the rocket to the moon, but it blew up before it got there." is grammatically correct. It contains a complete thought, or independent clause ("We launched the rocket to the moon"), followed by a coordinating conjunction ("but") that introduces another independent clause ("it blew up before it got there"). Both clauses contain a subject and a verb, which is necessary for a sentence to be grammatical. Additionally, the word "the" is correctly used as a definite article before both "moon" and "it," indicating specificity. There are no obvious spelling errors or misplaced words, so I would rate this sentence as being grammatically correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject-verb agreement is consistent throughout the sentence, and the word usage, punctuation, and tense are all appropriate. Additionally, the sentence contains a clear independent clause ("Sarah promised Catherine her old car") followed by a dependent clause ("but then gave it to her son instead"), which creates a logical flow of ideas.
1	The sentence "I lent the book partway to Tony" is grammatically correct. The verb "lend" is used correctly in the past tense, and it agrees with its subject "I." Additionally, the preposition "to" is appropriately connecting "partway" (an adverb modifying how the action was done) with the indirect object "Tony." There are no apparent errors in grammar, spelling, or punctuation, so the sentence can be considered a valid English statement.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence, "the farmer," is doing something, which is "loaded." The verb must agree with the subject in number, so a plural verb (e.g., "load" or "loads") would be incorrect here. Additionally, "the cart" is the direct object of the sentence because it receives the action of being loaded. Finally, "with apples" tells us what was loaded onto the cart, making it a prepositional phrase that modifies the verb "loaded." Overall, this sentence has a clear structure and follows all the rules of standard English grammar.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "The" is a definite article used to specify a particular noun (in this case, "farmer"). * "farmer" is a singular common noun that refers to someone who cultivates land or raises crops. * "dumped" is the past tense of the verb "to dump," which means to drop or unload something carelessly or hastily. It agrees with the subject ("the farmer") in number and person. * "the" is again used as a definite article before the plural countable noun "cart." * "cart" is a common noun referring to a small open vehicle drawn by animals or people. * "with apples" tells us what was inside the cart when it was being dumped. "apples" is a plural countable noun.
0	The verb "carved" does not agree with its subject "Martha." Since Martha is singular, the verb should also be singular, so it should be "carved" instead of "carved." Additionally, there is an ambiguity about who the recipient of the toy is - the baby or the wooden object being turned into a toy? A clearer phrasing might be "Martha carved a toy for the baby out of wood," which makes it clear that the toy is what is being made from the wood, and that the baby is the intended user of the finished product.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The present tense verb "cuts" agrees with its subject "the bread," which is a singular third-person noun. Additionally, the word order is appropriate for a simple declarative sentence.
0	The verb "broke" does not make sense in this context when used with the preposition "on". A more appropriate word might be "hurt", but even so, a better way to phrase it would be "Janet hurt Bill's finger."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence, "Janet," is performing the action described by the verb, "broke." The direct object of the sentence, "the cup," receives the action of the verb. There are no grammatical errors or awkward phrasings in this sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple tense verb ("rang") that agrees with its subject ("visitor"), and there are no spelling or punctuation errors.
0	The phrase "pulled free" is grammatically incomplete and lacks a clear object or context to make its meaning clear. A more complete version of the sentence might be something like "We pulled the boat free," which has a specific subject (we), verb (pulled), and direct object (the boat).
1	The sentence "That movie always shocks people" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "that movie," which is a singular noun modified by a demonstrative pronoun. The verb "shocks" agrees with the singular subject and indicates that the action (shocking) happens regularly or predictably, as indicated by the adverb "always." Finally, the object of the preposition "people" completes the meaning of the sentence. Overall, there are no grammatical errors to be found.
1	The sentence "That movie always shocks" is grammatically correct. It consists of a subordinating conjunction ("that"), a noun phrase ("that movie") acting as the subject, and a verb phrase ("always shocks"). There is no obvious grammatical error or awkward phrasing that would warrant changing it.
0	The sentence "Sharon came the room" is grammatically incorrect because it lacks a preposition (either "to" or "into") after the verb "came." A more appropriate way to phrase the sentence would be "Sharon came into the room" or "Sharon came to the room," depending on context.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Bill," who is performing the action of sending something. The direct object of the sentence is "a package," which is what is being sent. Finally, we have the indirect object "Tom," who is receiving the package. All of these elements work together smoothly to form a complete and proper sentence in English.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence ("That acorn") is singular, so the verb must also be singular. In this case, the verb "will grow" agrees with the subject "acorn." Additionally, the phrase "into an oak tree" correctly describes the future state of the acorn.
1	The sentence "He turned into a frog." is grammatically correct. The subject "he" is correctly used as the pronoun referring to a male singular person. The verb "turned" agrees with the third-person singular subject "he". Moreover, "into" is appropriately employed here to indicate change from one state or condition to another. Therefore, it's a valid English sentence without any grammatical errors.
1	The sentence "I mixed the sugar into the butter" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "I", which is the person performing the action. The verb is "mixed", which describes the action being performed. The direct object is "the sugar", which is the thing that is being acted upon. Finally, "into the butter" tells us where the action was performed. All of these elements come together to form a complete and proper sentence in English.
0	The sentence "Brian threw the fence with the stick" is grammatically incorrect because we cannot throw a fence with a stick. A more appropriate way to phrase it would be "Brian used the stick to throw over the fence."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence, "Mira," is doing the action described by the verb, "condemned." The object of the sentence, "Terry," receives the action of being condemned. Additionally, there is a prepositional phrase providing more information about the action taken ("for the accident"). All parts of speech are used correctly, so this sentence gets a score of 1.
1	The sentence "We investigated the area for bombs" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "we," which is a plural noun referring to the speaker and one or more other people. The verb "investigated" agrees with the plural subject because it is also a plural form. Additionally, the prepositional phrase "for bombs" functions as an adverbial complement specifying what was being looked for during the investigation. Overall, the structure and word choice within the sentence demonstrates proper usage of grammar rules, making it a complete and coherent thought.
1	The sentence "I sensed his eagereness" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "I", which is the person doing the action (sensed). The verb is "sensed", indicating that the speaker had a perception or intuition about something. The object of the sentence is "his eagerness", meaning the eagerness belonging to someone else, indicated by the possessive pronoun "his". This structure follows standard English grammar rules for subjects, verbs, and objects in a simple sentence.
1	The sentence "They praised the dedication in the volunteers" is grammatically correct. Here's a breakdown of why: - "They" is a plural subject pronoun referring to more than one person or entity. - "praised" is the past tense of the verb "to praise," which means to express approval or admiration. In this case, it agrees with the plural subject "they." - "the" is a definite article that introduces a specific noun phrase, "dedication in the volunteers." - "dedication" refers to the quality of being dedicated, and functions as the direct object of the sentence because it receives the action of the verb "praised." - "in" indicates location or position relative to something else, specifically the group of people referred to by "volunteers." - "the" is again used here as a definite article introducing the specific noun phrase "volunteers." This word represents a particular group of individuals who share a common characteristic (namely, volunteering). Overall, the sentence presents no grammatical errors, making it a valid construction within standard English.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The past tense of the verb "to be" (is) is used correctly with the subject "the earth." Additionally, the passive voice ("was believed") is also used appropriately here.
1	The sentence "Sarah smiled a charming smile" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence, "Sarah," is clearly identified, and the verb, "smiled," agrees with the singular subject. Additionally, the adjective phrase "a charming smile" modifies the noun "smile" appropriately. Therefore, I would classify this sentence as being grammatically correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Sandra," which is a noun that refers to a person. The verb of the sentence is "beamed," which describes the action performed by the subject. In this case, it means that Sandra showed or expressed a happy greeting through her expression or demeanor. The adjective "cheerful" modifies the word "welcome," describing what kind of welcome was shown. Overall, the structure of the sentence follows standard English grammar rules without any errors.
1	The sentence "You've really lived it up" is grammatically correct. It consists of a subject ("you"), an auxiliary verb ("have") that expresses present perfect tense, an adverb ("really") that modifies the verb, and the phrasal verb "lived it up," which means to enjoy oneself thoroughly or excessively. All elements are used correctly, so there are no errors in grammar, usage, or word choice.
0	The verb "lift" requires an object to complete its meaning, but there is no direct object in this sentence. A better way to phrase it would be "Paperback books can easily be lifted onto the table."
0	In present tense, we use 'lift' as the verb when the subject refers to a singular noun (e.g., "The boy lifts the book"). However, for plural subjects (in this case, 'books'), the correct form of the verb is 'lift'. Therefore, the correct sentence would be: "The books lift onto the table." But since it is more common to say "The books were lifted onto the table" or "Someone lifted the books onto the table," I will still mark this as incorrect because the original sentence structure doesn't make sense even if we change the verb form to match a plural subject.
1	The sentence "Jessica loaded boxes under the wagon" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Jessica," a proper noun that refers to a person. The verb is "loaded," which is a past tense regular verb indicating what action Jessica did. The object of the sentence is "boxes," a plural countable noun. Finally, the prepositional phrase "under the wagon" tells us where Jessica loaded the boxes. All these elements form a complete and coherent sentence with clear meaning, making it grammatically sound.
1	The sentence "Jessica loaded boxes on the wagon" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Jressica," and the verb is "loaded." The direct object is "boxes," which receives the action of the verb. The prepositional phrase "on the wagon" indicates where the action took place. Therefore, there are no grammatical errors in this sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Jessica," and the verb is "crammed." The direct object of the sentence is "boxes," which follows the verb and receives the action of the verb. The prepositional phrase "at the truck" indicates where the action took place. All of these elements combine to form a complete sentence that is both clear and concise.
0	The verb "butter" requires a direct object to complete its meaning, so the sentence "Lora buttered at the toast" is incorrect. It should be "Lora buttered the toast." In English, transitive verbs (verbs that require a direct object) cannot be followed by the preposition "at," which is used to indicate location or direction.
1	The sentence "Carla shoveled the walk" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Carla," which is a proper noun and therefore capitalized. The verb of the sentence is "shoveled," which is the past tense of the verb "shovel." This form of the verb agrees with the singular subject "Carla." The object of the sentence is "the walk," which is a common noun preceded by the definite article "the." Overall, the sentence has a clear structure and follows standard English grammar rules.
1	The sentence "Nora sent the book" is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("Nora"), an auxiliary verb ("did") which is implied in this context, and a direct object ("the book"). Additionally, each word is spelled correctly and uses appropriate punctuation.
1	The sentence "Nora sent Peter the book." is grammatically correct. It contains a simple subject ("Nora"), a verb that agrees with the subject in number and tense ("sent"), a direct object ("the book") and an indirect object ("Peter"). All of these elements combine to form a complete thought or idea, which makes it a well-formed sentence in English.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Carla," a noun that refers to a person. The verb of the sentence is "slid," which indicates past tense action. Finally, we have the direct object "the book," which tells us what was slid. Therefore, there are no errors present in this sentence.
0	The sentence "Carla slid at the book" is grammatically incorrect because the preposition "at" is used incorrectly here. When someone or something slides, it requires a surface to slide on, so we need to use the preposition "on" or "over." For example, "Carla slid over the book" or "Carla slid on top of the book" would be grammatical.
1	The sentence "Amanda carried the package to Pamela" is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("Amanda"), a verb ("carried") and an object ("the package"). Additionally, it includes a prepositional phrase headed by "to," which shows the direction of Amanda's action. All elements are used appropriately, making the sentence a complete and coherent thought.
0	The sentence contains a subject-verb agreement error. The subject of the sentence is "packages," which is plural. Therefore, the verb should also be plural. In this case, the verb "drive" should be changed to "drive" (present tense) or "drive" (past tense), depending on the intended meaning. A corrected version could be "Packages drive easily to New York" (if referring to something that packages can do themselves) or "Package drivers easily go to New York" (if referring to people who transport packages).
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It consists of a single independent clause, "the chair pushed," which contains a subject ("the chair") and a verb ("pushed"). The meaning of the sentence may be unclear without additional context, but that does not affect its grammaticality.
1	The sentence “We offered a job to her” is grammatically correct. Here's why: - The subject of the sentence is "we," which is a pronoun that refers to a group of people. - The verb is "offered," which agrees with the plural subject "we." It also shows past tense appropriately. - There is a direct object "a job" which receives the action from the verb. - Lastly, there is an indirect object "her" who is receiving the offer for the job. All these elements work together cohesively making it a proper English sentence.
0	The sentence "A job offered" is grammatically incomplete as it lacks a subject or an object to form a complete thought. It could be revised to something like "They offered a job," or "A job was offered."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence, "Brown," is the person performing the action (presenting), so it is in the nominative case. "A plaque" is the direct object because it receives the action of being presented; its quantity is singular, which matches the verb form "presented." Prepositions such as "to" take objects in the objective case, here "Jones," who follows after the preposition. All elements agree with each other appropriately according to their grammatical roles.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Carmen," who is performing the action of buying something. The direct object of the sentence is "dress," which is what Carmen is buying for someone else. "Mary" is the indirect object because she is receiving the dress that Carmen purchased. All of these elements come together to form a complete and proper English sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence, "Carmen," is doing the action indicated by the verb, "obtained." Additionally, we have a direct object, "the spare part," which tells us what Carmen obtained. Finally, the prepositional phrase "at the hardware store" provides additional information about where Carmen obtained the spare part.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Michelle," and she is performing the action of "keeping" something. That something is specified as "the desk with the papers." In English, it's common to use a prepositional phrase (in this case, "with the papers") after describing which particular instance of a noun we mean ("the desk"). So this sentence is perfectly acceptable!
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence, "Frances," is doing the action described by the verb, "hid." We know what or who was hidden (the presents) because of the object pronoun "the" before "presents." Finally, we have a prepositional phrase that tells us where she hid them ("in the drawer"). All in all, it's clear, concise, and contains no grammatical errors!
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It consists of a subject ("the needle"), an auxiliary verb ("did" is implied), and a past tense verb ("poked"). Additionally, it contains a direct object ("the cloth") that receives the action of the verb. All of these elements combine to form a complete thought, making the sentence grammatically sound.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("Carrie"), an auxiliary verb ("touched") to indicate past tense, and an object ("that cat"). The word order follows standard English syntax rules, making it easy for native speakers to understand.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The verb "whipped" agrees with its subject "Herman," which is singular. Additionally, both "sugar" and "cream" serve as direct objects of the verb "whipped." There are no grammatical errors or awkward phrasings that would require correction.
1	The sentence "Linda taped the picture to the wall" is grammatically correct. Here's a breakdown of why it works: * "Linda" serves as the subject of the sentence, indicating who performed the action. * "taped" functions as the verb (past tense), showing what action was taken. * "the picture" represents the direct object, which receives the action of being taped. * "to the wall" indicates where the action occurred, serving as an adverbial phrase. Overall, the structure is clear and concise, making for a proper and well-constructed English sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Linda," which is a noun that refers to a person. The verb in the sentence is "taped," which indicates past tense action. The direct object of the sentence is "the picture," which receives the action of being taped. Finally, the prepositional phrase "onto the wall" describes where the action took place. Overall, the structure of the sentence is clear and concise, making it a grammatical English sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "the child and her mother," which is a compound subject connected by the conjunction "and." Both "child" and "mother" are singular nouns, so the verb must be plural to agree with the subject. In this case, "clung" is the past tense of the plural verb "cling," making the sentence grammatically sound.
1	The sentence "This flyer and that flyer differ" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "this flyer and that flyer," which is a compound noun phrase connected by the conjunction "and." The verb "differ" correctly agrees with the plural subject. Therefore, there are no grammatical errors in this sentence.
0	The phrase "differ apart" is incorrect. Instead, use either "differ" or "differ from." In this case, since both objects being compared are mentioned (this flyer and that flyer), it would be best to say "This flyer and that flyer differ."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. Here's a breakdown of why: * "The" is a proper definite article used before a noun to indicate that it refers to something specific (in this case, a particular jeweler). * "Jeweler" is the subject of the sentence, which is a person who sells jewelry or precious stones. It is spelled correctly and has been appropriately pluralized as singular. * "Scribbled" is the verb in past tense form, indicating that the action happened in the past. In this context, it means to write carelessly or hurriedly. * "The contract" is the direct object, receiving the action of being scribbled by the jeweler. A contract is a written agreement between two parties. * "With his name" describes how the jeweler scribbled the contract. It tells us that he signed his name on the document.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("the gardener"), a verb ("grew"), and an object ("that acorn"). Additionally, it uses the past tense appropriately to indicate that the action occurred in the past. Furthermore, the phrase "into an oak tree" functions as an adverbial prepositional phrase modifying the verb "grew," indicating what the acorn became after being grown by the gardener.
1	The sentence "I shaped a loaf" is grammatically correct. It consists of a subject ("I"), a verb ("shaped"), and an object ("a loaf"). The verb agrees with the subject in number (both singular), which is also correct. No spelling or punctuation errors can be found in this sentence.
0	This sentence is missing a direct object, which is necessary to complete the meaning of the verb "amuse." A corrected version could be "The children amused us," or "The children amused themselves" if there is more context indicating what they found amusing.
1	The sentence "Susan whispered the news" is grammatically correct. In this sentence, "whispered" is the past tense of the verb "whisper," which means to speak very softly or quietly so that others cannot easily hear. Here, it indicates that Susan spoke the news in a soft or quiet voice. Therefore, there are no grammatical errors in this sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence, "Susan," is performing the action (whispering) on the object of the sentence, "Rachel." Additionally, we use the preposition "at" to indicate direction or location when someone is whispering, so the usage of "at" here is also appropriate.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Ellen," which is a proper noun and the person performing the action. The verb of the sentence is "said," which indicates past tense through its "-ed" ending. Following the conjunction "that," we have another clause beginning with the plural, third-person pronoun "melons." After the linking verb "were," we see the present participle phrase "selling well," indicating ongoing activity or state related to the subject of the sentence. Overall, it's structured correctly and each word fits into its role effectively.
0	The sentence is incomplete and has a missing element. Instead of saying "about the present conditions," it would be better to say "about the present conditions of..." or something similar that makes clear what "present conditions" refers to. Additionally, there might be a word missing after "said." It's unclear who or what Ellen referred to without more context.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Ellen," who is doing the action of warning. The indirect object is "Helen" and the direct object is "skating on thin ice." There is a clear structure to the sentence that makes sense and follows all the rules of standard English grammar.
1	The sentence "Cynthia nibbled on the carrot" is grammatically correct. Here's a breakdown of why: * "Cynthia" is a proper noun that refers to a person (or possibly an animal), so it is correctly written starting with a capital letter. * "nibbled" is the past tense of the verb "nibble," which means to eat something slowly or gently. It agrees with the subject "Cynthia." * "on" is a preposition that indicates the relationship between the action of nibbling and the object being nibbled. * "the carrot" is a definite article followed by a singular countable noun. This phrase functions as the direct object of the sentence, receiving the action of nibbling.
1	The sentence "Cynthia chewed" is grammatically correct. It consists of a proper noun (Cynthia) as the subject and a past tense verb (chewed), which agrees with the third-person singular subject. Therefore, there are no errors to be corrected.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence, "Paul," is doing the action of laughing, which is indicated by the verb "laughed." The object of the sentence, "Mary," is receiving the action. Both nouns and verbs agree in number (singular), and the sentence follows a clear subject-verb-object structure.
0	The error in this sentence lies in the object of the verb "wink." In standard English, we do not say "wink one's lip" because lips don't have a mobile part that can be moved to convey meaning as eyes do when blinking or winking. Instead, people typically "smile," "pout," or make other facial expressions using their lips. Therefore, a possible correction could be "Linda smiled" or "Linda puckered her lips."
0	The verb "pound" requires a direct object to complete its meaning, but in this sentence, there's no noun or pronoun that receives the action of being pounded. A more appropriate way to phrase it would be "My heart is pounding (in my chest)" or "I can feel my heart pounding."
1	The sentence "Sharon fainted from hunger" is grammatically correct. Here's why: - The subject of the sentence is "Sharon," which is a proper noun and correctly capitalized. - The verb of the sentence is "fainted," which agrees with the singular subject "Sharon." It also indicates past tense through its past tense form "-ed." - The preposition "from" introduces the cause or origin of Sharon's fainting spell, namely her extreme hunger. - Overall, the sentence has a clear structure and conveys complete meaning without any grammatical errors.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple sentence structure, where the subject ("the witch") performs the action (poisoned) on the object ("the children"). There are no spelling or punctuation errors present.
1	The sentence "A grandfather clock ticked in the hallway" is grammatically correct. Here's a breakdown of why it works: * "Grandfather clock" is a noun phrase that refers to a type of tall, freestanding pendulum clock often found in homes or public buildings. It functions as the subject of the sentence. * "Ticked" is the simple past tense form of the verb "to tick," which means to make a series of short, quick sounds, especially regularly or repeatedly. In this context, it indicates that the sound made by the clock was heard in the past. * "In the hallway" is a prepositional phrase acting as an adverbial clause, describing where the action (the ticking) took place. Prepositions such as "in" help situate objects, people, or actions within a spatial or temporal framework.
0	The verb "squeak" typically does not take a direct object. One cannot "squeak something." Instead, one can only "squeak" or perhaps more specifically, make a squeaking sound. Thus, the proper way to phrase the sentence would be "I squeezed (past tense) the doorknob," if the intention was that the person caused the door to produce a squeaking noise by turning its knob. Alternatively, they could have said "I squaked like a mouse," if their intent was to describe making such a sound themselves.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "a fragrant stew," which is correctly modified by the adjective "fragrant." The verb "bubbled" agrees with its singular subject in number. The prepositional phrase "over the fire" modifies the action of the verb, giving us more information about where the stew was bubbling. All in all, this is a well-constructed sentence.
1	The sentence "Soaring temperatures are predicted for this weekend." is grammatically correct. It follows standard subject-verb-object word order and uses a past tense verb to express a prediction about the future, which is a common idiomatic usage of English. Additionally, there are no spelling or punctuation errors present in the sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. There is a subject ("the fort"), a verb ("fluttered") and an object complement ("many flags"). Additionally, there is no spelling or punctuation errors. Therefore, I would rate this sentence as being grammatically correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple declarative sentence with a subject ("the voices") and a verb ("echoed"). Additionally, it uses a prepositional phrase to describe where the action took place ("in the hall"). All elements of grammar and syntax are used correctly in this sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It contains a simple subject ("the stream") and a verb ("twists"), followed by a prepositional phrase ("through the valley") that describes where the action takes place. There are no spelling or punctuation errors, and the word order follows standard English rules. Therefore, I would rate this sentence as correct.
0	The past tense of the verb "present" is "presented," but it needs to be followed by a subject, not an object (a "wonderful opportunity") directly. A more grammatically correct way to phrase the sentence would be: "A wonderful opportunity presented itself yesterday."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "a wonderful opportunity," which is singular. The verb that agrees with a singular subject is "presented." Therefore, there is no error in subject-verb agreement. Additionally, the word "yesterday" correctly indicates when the event took place. Overall, the sentence flows smoothly and makes sense in English.
1	The sentence "Out of the box jumped a little white rabbit." is grammatically correct. Here's why: * The subject of the sentence is "a little white rabbit," which is modified by the adjectives "little" and "white." Adjectives typically come before the noun they modify, so this order is grammatically acceptable. * The verb of the sentence is "jumped," which agrees with the singular subject "rabbit." Additionally, it indicates past tense, indicating that the action has already occurred. * There is no missing or extraneous information in the sentence, making it clear and concise. Overall, the sentence follows standard English grammar rules and does not contain any errors.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Penny," which is a noun that refers to a person or thing being referred to. The verb of the sentence is "skated," which agrees with the singular subject "Penny" in number (third-person singular) and indicates past tense. Finally, "around the rink" is a prepositional phrase acting as an adverbial modifier indicating where Penny skated. All these elements form a complete thought making it a proper sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Jackie," who is performing the action indicated by the verb "accompanied." The object of the sentence is "Rose," who is receiving the action. Both the subject and verb agree in number (both are singular), making for a complete and coherent thought.
0	The verb "was" does not agree with its subject "many information." In this case, "information" is a plural noun, so the proper form of the verb should be "were," making the corrected sentence "Many pieces of information were provided."
0	The word "advice" is uncountable, so it should be used with a singular verb. The correct sentence should be "John offers much advice." or "John offers a lot of advice."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It uses a comparative structure ("more delicious") to compare two things (the cakes that Jones and Smith got), which is grammatically correct. Additionally, it uses proper verb tense agreement and word order.
0	The sentence contains a minor error in subject-verb agreement. The plural subjects "cake" and "pastry" require a plural verb for proper agreement. Therefore, the corrected sentence would be: "We recommend eating less cake and pastries."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "I," which is the person who performed the action of seeing. The verb of the sentence is "saw," which describes the past tense action taken by the subject. The object of the sentence is "that gas can explode," which refers to a potential future event. Overall, the sentence follows standard English grammar rules and is understandable.
1	The sentence "He washed her" is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple sentence structure with a subject ("he"), verb ("washed"), and object ("her"). All words are spelled correctly and there are no punctuation or grammar errors. Therefore, I would rate this sentence as correct.
0	The verb 'wash' must have a direct object to complete its meaning, but there is no direct object specified in the sentence 'Wash you!' A more appropriate way to phrase it would be 'Wash yourself!' or 'Someone wash you.' because these sentences provide a clear direct object for the verb 'wash'.
0	The sentence "They have no in" is grammatically incorrect because it is missing a complete thought or object. It seems that there might be a missing word such as "problem," "idea," etc., which would make the sentence complete and understandable. For example, if we say "They have no ideas," then the sentence becomes grammatically correct.
0	The subject of the sentence is incorrect. It should be "Some **of** my jobs," not just "some my jobs." This is because we need a preposition ("of") to connect the plural noun "jobs" with its determiner "my". Therefore, the corrected version would be: "Some *of* my jobs are in jeopardy."
0	The verb tense used in the sentence does not agree. The past tense of the verb "to be" (was) is only used before a singular subject, but "policeman" is plural because it is preceded by the word "several." Therefore, we need to use the plural form of the past tense for verbs ("were") instead of "was": "It were the policemen who met several young students in the park last night." However, since "it" cannot grammatically take on the plural form "were," this revised version still doesn't work perfectly; thus, I would suggest rephrasing the entire sentence. For instance, one could say, "Several young students were met by police officers in the park last night."
0	The sentence contains a grammatical error. It should be "did the policeman meet IN the park?" instead of "did the policeman meet IN THE park?" Inversion (i.e., moving the auxiliary verb "did" before the subject) occurs only in questions where the interrogative word or phrase comes at the beginning of the question. Here, there's no interrogative word or phrase, so we don't need to use inversion. Hence, the corrected sentence would be "The policeman met someone in the park."
1	The sentence "John put old books in the box" is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("John"), a verb ("put") that agrees with the subject in number (both singular), and two objects of the preposition "in" - "old books" and "the box." Each part of speech is used correctly and there are no spelling errors or awkward phrasings.
0	This sentence is missing a verb. A corrected version could be "The monkeys are proud of their leader" or "The monkeys were proud of their leader," depending on the intended tense.
0	The sentence "John sounded very" is missing a descriptive word after "very." A complete sentence requires both a subject (in this case, "John") and a predicate (a verb or verb phrase), but here we only have a subject without any accompanying information about what John did or how he sounded. Therefore, I cannot consider it to be grammatically correct until more context has been provided.
1	The sentence "I don't know if I should agree" is grammatically correct. It contains a main clause "I don't know," which expresses uncertainty or lack of knowledge about something. The dependent clause "if I should agree" indicates a condition that may affect the speaker's decision to agree or disagree. Both clauses contain proper verb forms, subject-verb agreement, and punctuation, making it a valid English sentence.
1	The sentence "John bought a book on the table" is grammatically correct. Here's why: - The subject of the sentence is "John," which is a proper noun and correctly identified as the person who performed the action. - The verb of the sentence is "bought," which indicates that John performed some kind of transaction. This word agrees with the singular subject "John." - We have an article ("a") followed by the noun "book," indicating what was bought. - Finally, we see the prepositional phrase "on the table," specifying where the book was located during or after the purchase. Overall, each part of speech functions appropriately within the context of the sentence, so it receives a score of 1 for grammaticality.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence, "John," is the person who performed the action described by the verb, "called." The direct object of the sentence, "the president," receives the action of the verb. Finally, the adjective "a" modifies the noun "fool." All of these elements combine to form a complete thought, making the sentence grammatically sound.
1	The sentence "I forgot how good beer tastes." is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "I", which is followed by a verb tense that indicates past action ("forgot"). After that, there's a noun clause "how good beer tastes" acting as the direct object of the sentence. This structure creates a complex sentence that follows standard English grammar rules.
1	The sentence "This teacher is a genius" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence, "this teacher," is singular and the verb "is" agrees with it in number. Additionally, there are no misspelled words or incorrect word usage. Therefore, I would classify this sentence as being grammatically correct.
0	The verb "remains" should be used instead of "is remained." Additionally, it would sound more natural to say "he has remained" or "he remains" rather than simply "is remained." Also, a more natural way to phrase the entire sentence might be "He remains a good friend to me."
1	The sentence "John ate his noodle quietly" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "John," which is a proper noun and the name of a person. The verb of the sentence is "ate," which indicates past tense and agrees with the singular subject "John." The object of the sentence is "his noodle," where "noodle" is a common noun that has been made possessive by adding the word "his" before it. Finally, the adverb "quietly" modifies the verb "ate" to describe how the action was performed. Therefore, there are no grammatical errors in this sentence, so I would return 1 for this input.
1	The sentence "A smith hammered the metal" is grammatically correct. Here's a breakdown of why it works: * "A smith": This is an indefinite article ("a") followed by a singular noun that serves as the subject of the sentence. It indicates a specific person who hammers things but does not identify them uniquely (as opposed to using "the"). * "hammered": This is the past tense of the verb "to hammer." In this context, it tells us what action the smith performed on the metal. * "the metal": This is a definite article ("the") followed by a plural countable noun serving as the direct object of the sentence. Using "the" here implies we know which particular piece or pieces of metal were being worked on.
1	The sentence "Sandy removed her ballet shoes" is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple sentence structure where the subject ("Sandy") performs the action ("removed") on the object ("her ballet shoes"). All elements agree in number (singular), and there are no apparent spelling or punctuation errors.
1	The sentence "This week will be a difficult one for us." is grammatically correct. Here's why: - "This" refers to a specific week that has been mentioned or implied beforehand. It could also refer to the current week. - "week" is a noun referring to seven days starting from Sunday and ending on Saturday. - "will be" is used here as an auxiliary verb indicating future tense. - "a difficult one" modifies the noun "week", describing it as challenging. - "for us" explains who the difficult week would affect. Therefore, the sentence is grammatically correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence, "Benny," is clearly identified, and we understand that he performed work at a specific location, "a shoe factory," during a particular time frame, "when he was a student." Additionally, verb tense is consistent throughout the sentence, with "worked" indicating past tense to match the time frame provided.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "everyone," which is a plural noun referring to multiple people. However, it is being treated as singular because we cannot easily make it plural ("Everyones"). Despite this, the verb "hoped" agrees with the subject and is conjugated correctly for a third-person singular pronoun (he/she/it). Additionally, the subordinate clause "that she would sing" contains a proper relative pronoun and appropriate verb tense and agreement. Overall, this sentence demonstrates standard English syntax and usage, so no corrections or improvements are necessary.
1	The sentence "This proved a decisive factor" is grammatically correct. Here's why: - "This" refers to something previously mentioned or known from context, serving as the subject of the sentence. - "proved" functions as the verb in past tense, indicating that what "this" refers to had a certain effect or outcome (being decisive) in the past. - "a decisive factor" serves as the direct object complement for the sentence, providing more information about the nature of "this." A factor being described as "decisive" implies it played a crucial role in determining the result of a situation. Since all elements work together coherently without any grammatical errors, I would rate this sentence as correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It consists of a subject ("the crocodile"), a verb ("devoured") and an object ("the doughnut"). Additionally, all words are spelled correctly and there are no punctuation errors.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "John," and he is modified by the adjective "afraid." The object of his fear is "Bill." Both names are correctly capitalized, and the verb agrees with its singular subject. There are no missing or extraneous words, and the word order follows standard English syntax rules. Therefore, I would rate this sentence as grammatically correct.
0	The sentence "John put under the bathtub" is grammatically incorrect because it lacks a preposition to indicate where John placed something. A corrected version could be "John put something under the bathtub."
1	The sentence "John placed Kim behind the garage" is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("John"), a verb ("placed") that agrees with the subject in number, and a direct object ("Kim"). Additionally, it includes a prepositional phrase ("behind the garage") that modifies where Kim was placed. All of these elements work together to form a complete thought, making the sentence grammatically sound.
0	The sentence contains a grammatical error. It should be "Kim depends on Sandy" instead of "Kim depends for Sandy". In English, we use 'depend on' to express reliance or dependence on someone or something, followed by the preposition 'on'.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "John," who is performing the action described by the verb "put." The direct object of the sentence is "the book," which is being acted upon by the verb. Finally, we have the prepositional phrase "in the box" telling us where the action took place or the location of the direct object after it was moved there. All in all, a well-constructed sentence!
1	The sentence "John taught English Syntax to new students." is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "John" is a proper noun that refers to a person's name, so it is capitalized correctly. * "taught" is the past tense of the verb "teach," which indicates that the action happened in the past. It agrees with the subject "John." * "English Syntax" is a compound noun that serves as the direct object of the sentence. Both words are capitalized because they refer to specific academic subjects. * "to" is a preposition introducing the infinitive phrase "to new students." * "new students" is also a compound noun serving as the indirect object of the sentence. Both words are appropriate for describing people who have just started attending school or learning something new.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "John," who is performing the action of regarding someone. The verb is "regards" which must be followed by a noun or pronoun, in this case "Bill." The phrase "as a good friend" functions as an adjective phrase modifying "Bill" to describe his role in relation to John.
1	The sentence "Kim put in the box" is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple sentence with a subject ("Kim") and a verb ("put"). The phrase "in the box" functions as an adverbial phrase indicating where the action took place. Therefore, I would classify this sentence as being grammatically correct and assign it a score of 1.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple subject ("the chickens") and a predicate ("seem fond of the farmer"). Additionally, it uses appropriate verb tense (present simple) to describe an ongoing situation or general truth. All elements follow standard English grammar rules, so no corrections are necessary.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It follows standard subject-verb-object word order, uses a proper verb tense, and all words are spelled correctly. Additionally, it conveys a clear meaning without any ambiguity or confusion.
0	The verb tense in the first part of the sentence ("That Fred was unpopular") is past passive participle, which requires a helping verb to form a complete thought or sentence. Additionally, there seems to be a missing conjunction between "unpopular" and "nominated." A corrected version could read: "That Fred was unpopular *and* he nominated Bill," but even that would require additional context for clarity since it's still somewhat awkward and confusing.
1	The sentence "They were taking a hard look at possible FTA" is grammatically correct. There are no spelling errors or punctuation issues. Additionally, the verb tense ("were taking") agrees with the subject ("they"), and the object of the preposition ("at") is clear and correctly placed. Therefore, I would rate this sentence as being grammatically correct.
0	The preposition "against" is incorrect in this context. It seems that the speaker wants to say that John paid them for a book. A more appropriate way to phrase it would be "John paid me for the book."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "the committee," which is a plural noun taking a singular verb ("will study") because it refers to a single group acting as a unit. The infinitive phrase "setting up" functions as the direct object of the verb "study." Finally, "a national computer network" is a correctly constructed noun phrase serving as the goal or result of the action expressed by the main clause.
0	The verb "made" is a transitive verb that requires a direct object to complete its meaning. In this case, "them" is acting as the direct object of the verb "made". However, there needs to be another word or phrase after "them" because "made them" alone does not convey any specific action. Additionally, it's generally considered poor etiquette to intentionally make someone behave rudely. Instead, one might say something like "We caused them to act impolitely," although even that phrasing implies some level of indirect responsibility for their behavior.
1	The sentence "After reading the pamphlet, Judy threw it into the garbage can." is grammatically correct. There are no spelling errors or misplaced words. Additionally, the sentence follows a logical sequence of events (reading followed by throwing away). All punctuation marks are used correctly as well.
0	The verb in the sentence should agree with its subject in number. In this case, the subject is "students," which is plural. Therefore, the correct form of the verb to use would be "read" instead of "reads." Hence, a corrected version of the sentence would read as follows: "Students studying English read Conrad's Heart of Darkness while at university."
1	The sentence "I read some of the book" is grammatically correct. Here's a breakdown: * "I": This is a first-person singular subject pronoun used to indicate the person performing the action (reading). It's grammatically correct. * "read": This is the past tense of the verb "to read." In this context, it indicates that the speaker has already performed the action of reading something from the book but might still be reading more or have finished reading it. It's also grammatically correct. * "some": This is a determiner indicating an unspecified amount of the following noun phrase ("of the book"). Its use here implies that only part of the book was read rather than its entirety. It's grammatically correct. * "of": This preposition introduces the second element of the prepositional phrase "of the book," which describes what specific portion of the book was being referred to. It's grammatically correct. * "the": This definite article refers specifically to one instance of the thing it precedes, implying the existence of a unique entity known to both the speaker and listener. In this case, it refers to a single, specific book. It's grammatically correct. * "book": This is a common noun referring to a set of written, printed, illustrated, or blank sheets made of ink, paper, parchment, or other materials, usually fastened together to hinge at one side. It's grammatically correct as well.
1	The sentence "Most of the fruit is rotten" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "Most" is a determiner that indicates quantity or extent. It modifies the noun phrase "the fruit." * "Of" is a preposition that shows relationship between two things. In this case, it relates "most" to "the fruit." * "The" is a definite article that specifies which particular group of fruits is being referred to. * "Fruit" is a singular countable noun that refers to any food that comes from trees, plants, or vines. * "Is" is a linking verb that connects the subject ("most of the fruit") to its predicate ("rotten"). * "Rotten" is an adjective that describes the state or condition of the fruit. Therefore, the sentence is grammatically correct because all the words are used appropriately and follow standard English grammar rules.
0	The sentence contains a double negative, which can create confusion in meaning. A better way to phrase it would be "Neither student failed." or "Both students succeeded."
0	In the sentence "I drank some of water," the word "some" needs to be followed by a plural noun or uncountable noun without the article "a" or "an." The noun "water" is already a mass (uncountable) noun, so there's no need for an additional determiner such as "some." A corrected version would be "I drank some water."
0	The noun "hair" should be plural after the adjective "golden," as it refers to multiple strands of hair rather than just one. Therefore, the corrected form would be "It is golden **hairs**."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "the boy," which is singular. The verb that agrees with a singular subject is "waved." The prepositional phrase "in the doorway" modifies the subject and gives more information about where the boy was located. The direct object of the sentence is "his father," who received the wave from the boy. Overall, this sentence has a clear structure and proper grammar usage.
1	The sentence "That dog is so ferocious, it even tried to bite itself." is grammatically correct. The subject-verb agreement is consistent throughout the sentence, and the pronoun "it" clearly refers back to "that dog," which was mentioned earlier in the sentence. Additionally, the verb tense remains consistent as well - "is" for present tense and "tried" for past tense both describe a singular noun (the dog). Overall, there are no apparent grammatical errors or awkward phrasings that would warrant changing this sentence's structure.
0	The verb 'wash' requires an object to complete its meaning, but 'yourself' is a reflexive pronoun that already includes the idea of an object (the person performing the action on themselves). Therefore, using both together creates redundancy and grammatically incorrect sentence. A better way to phrase it would be 'He washed himself.' or 'He washed you./him./her./us./them.', depending on who was being washed.
0	The sentence contains a grammatical error known as a dangling modifier. In this case, "easy to please" is intended to modify "Kim," but it's actually modifying "John." A corrected version of the sentence would be "John is easy to please; Kim just has to smile." Alternatively, if the intended meaning is that Kim pleases John easily, the sentence could be rephrased as "Kim easily pleases John."
0	The sentence "There seemed to be intelligent" is missing a noun after "intelligent." A more complete version of the sentence might be "There seemed to be intelligent life on the planet," or something similar where there's a clear subject following the word "intelligent." As it stands, though, the sentence is grammatically incomplete and incorrect.
1	The sentence "John tried to please Stephen" is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple tense verb phrase ("tried") followed by an infinitive verb phrase ("to please") and its direct object ("Stephen"). There are no spelling errors or awkward phrasings that would make it incorrect.
0	This sentence is grammatically incorrect because it uses "a" before a singular noun ("fountain") that follows a verb of perception or belief ("believed"). The correct form would use the article "the," as in "We believed John to be the fountain in the park." However, even with this correction, the meaning of the sentence remains unclear without additional context. It's possible that the intended meaning is something like "We thought John was sitting on the bench near the fountain in the park," but the original wording does not convey this idea clearly.
0	The verb "tries" should be in third-person singular form ("tryes") if we're referring to a single subject. However, it seems that there might be some confusion here because the subject of the sentence isn't explicitly stated. A more proper way to phrase this would be "He/She tries to leave the country." or, if referring to someone unspecified, use plural nouns such as "People try to leave the country," which will follow standard agreement rules for verbs.
1	The sentence "John tries to leave the country" is grammatically correct. Here's why: - The subject of the sentence is "John," which is a proper noun. Proper nouns always begin with a capital letter. - The verb tense used is present progressive (tries), indicating that John is currently attempting to leave the country. This form is appropriate for ongoing actions or states of being. - "To leave" functions as an infinitive here, acting as the complement of the verb "tries." It indicates what action John is trying to do. - Finally, "the country" refers to a specific nation, making it clear where John wants to go. Overall, the structure and usage of words make this sentence grammatically sound.
1	The sentence "Under the bed seems to be a fun place to hide" is grammatically correct. The phrase "under the bed" functions as an adverbial of place, modifying the verb "to be". The subject "a fun place to hide" follows the linking verb "seems", which agrees with its singular subject in number. Finally, the modal verb "to seem" indicates that the statement about the location under the bed being a fun hiding spot is based on appearance or probability rather than certainty.
0	The verb "is" or "are" should be used instead of "to be" after "there is believed." Additionally, "sheep" should be plural because it refers to more than one animal. A corrected version would read: "There are believed to be sheep in the park."
0	The sentence contains a mistake in verb tense agreement. In this context, we need to use "will" instead of "would." Also, there's no comma needed after 'Firstly.' A corrected version might be: "Firstly, I will study in France."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence, "John," is a proper noun that agrees with the verb "can." The verb tense is present indicative active, which indicates an ability or possibility. The direct object of the sentence, "the ball," is a singular common noun that follows correctly after the transitive verb "kick." There are no spelling errors, punctuation errors, or other grammatical issues in this sentence.
0	The verb "rain" is an intransitive verb which does not take a direct object. It also describes something that happens naturally without any human intervention. Therefore, it would be incorrect to say "John will rain tomorrow." Instead, we can say "It will rain tomorrow."
0	The verb tense is incorrect in this sentence. Instead of "there to will rain," it should be "it will be raining." In addition, a more natural way to phrase the sentence would be "It is going to rain" or "We can expect rain."
1	The sentence "John was found in the office" is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple tense verb phrase ("was found") that links its subject ("John") to its prepositional phrase complement ("in the office"). All words are spelled correctly, and there are no awkward or unidiomatic phrases present.
0	The verb "be" should be used as an auxiliary verb in the past tense ("did be") or present tense ("is/am/are"), but it cannot stand alone as the main verb in a sentence. Additionally, subject-auxiliary inversion (e.g., "Did the child...") requires a question format, so we need to add a question mark at the end of the sentence. A corrected version could be "Did the child behave in school?" or "Is the child in school?" depending on context.
1	The sentence "It did not rain" is grammatically correct. Here's why: - "It" serves as a dummy subject, which is often used when referring to weather conditions or time. - "did not" is a contraction of "did" and "not," indicating past tense negation. - "rain" is a verb that describes a weather condition. The sentence has a clear structure and follows standard English grammar rules. Therefore, it receives a score of 1 for being grammatically correct.
0	The sentence contains a double negative ("not" and "never"), which can create confusion and is generally considered incorrect in standard English. A correct version of this sentence could be "John doesn't want to leave the town."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject-verb agreement is consistent throughout the sentence (Mary likes, Bill hates), and the punctuation is appropriate (comma after the conjunction but). Additionally, there are no spelling errors or awkward phrasings that would detract from the clarity of meaning.
1	The sentence "They needn't take this exam" is grammatically correct. The auxiliary verb "needn't" is used correctly as a contraction of "do not need to." It indicates that taking the exam is not necessary for them. Therefore, I am returning 1 indicating that the sentence is correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Ann," who is a singular noun. Therefore, the verb must be in third-person singular form, which it is ("spend"). Additionally, the prepositional phrase "in Italy" correctly modifies the verb by telling us where Ann will spend her vacation.
1	The sentence "They love to play golf, but I do not." is grammatically correct. In the first clause, "they" is a plural subject that agrees with the verb phrase "love to play," which is also in the present tense. The second clause uses the contraction "I do not" as a negative response to indicate a contrast between the speaker (I) and others (they). Both clauses use appropriate punctuation, making the entire sentence clear and easy to understand.
1	The sentence "George has spent a lot of money, hasn't he?" is grammatically correct. It follows the standard structure for a question tag in English where the auxiliary verb (has) from the main clause is repeated after the subject (he), followed by the pronoun (he) with a change in polarity indicated by "not" to form a tag question. This type of construction seeks confirmation or clarification about the information presented in the main clause.
0	The sentence contains an error related to verb tense agreement. The past simple form of the verb ("scarcely could") does not agree with its subject ("he"). It should be changed to the past perfect form ("scarcely had been able to") or present perfect form ("has scarcely been able to"), depending on context. So, a possible correction would be: "As a statesman, he had scarcely been able to do anything worth mentioning."
1	The sentence "We never found any of the unicorns" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "We" is a subject pronoun that agrees with the plural verb form "found." * "never" is an adverb modifying the verb "found," indicating a negative situation. * "any" is used as a determiner before the noun phrase "of the unicorns," which refers to multiple unicorns. * "the unicorns" is a plural noun phrase, where "unicorns" is modified by the definite article "the" to refer to specific or previously mentioned unicorns. Therefore, there are no grammatical errors in this sentence.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no spelling errors or punctuation marks missing. It also follows a logical structure where it identifies one of Korea's famous poets as the writer of some lines (although the actual lines themselves aren't provided).
1	The sentence "Somebody apparently struck the unidentified victim during the early morning hours." is grammatically correct. There are no spelling errors, punctuation errors, or grammatical errors in the sentence. Additionally, the word choice is appropriate for formal writing. Therefore, I would classify this sentence as being grammatically correct and assign it a score of 1.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple past tense verb ("was driven") that agrees with its subject ("the car"). Additionally, there is no missing or extra information, and all words are spelled correctly. Therefore, it receives a score of 1 for being a grammatically accurate sentence.
1	The sentence "Ricky can be relied on" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * The subject of the sentence is "Ricky," which is a proper noun and does not require any articles (a, an, or the) before it. * The verb phrase "can be relied on" consists of an auxiliary verb "can" followed by the past participle form "been." This structure indicates that the sentence expresses ability or possibility rather than stating an absolute fact. * Finally, the preposition "on" takes the gerund form "relying" as its complement, indicating that Ricky has the quality or characteristic of being trustworthy or dependable. Overall, the sentence conveys a positive evaluation of Ricky's reliability, using appropriate grammatical structures to do so.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The past participle form of the verb "sleep" (i.e., "slept") can be used here as a passive voice or adjectival phrase to describe the state of the bed after someone has slept in it.
0	The verb tense used in this sentence does not make logical sense. The past tense of the verb "weigh" (was weighed) indicates that the action occurred in the past, but there is no clear subject performing the action. Additionally, it's unclear what it means for a "pound" to be weighed, since a pound is a unit of weight itself. It would be more appropriate to say something like "The book was weighed on the scale."
1	The sentence "Who do you think Tom saw?" is grammatically correct. It is a question asking about the object of the verb "saw" in a dependent clause, which is introduced by the word "who." This type of construction is common in English and does not contain any grammatical errors.
1	The sentence "he had spent five thousand dollars" is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple past perfect tense verb ("had spent") followed by the object ("five thousand dollars"). There are no spelling or punctuation errors, and the word order is logical. Therefore, I would rate this sentence as being grammatically correct and assign it a score of 1.
0	The pronouns used in this sentence do not agree. It's unclear who "her" refers to because there's no clear female antecedent mentioned earlier in the sentence. Additionally, if we assume that "Fed" is a person (which is itself unusual since it's typically short for Federal), the verb form should be "knows," not "know." A corrected version could be: "Fred knows which politician to vote for."
0	The sentence contains a pronoun "he" without specifying who it refers to. Without context or additional information about who "he" is, the reader cannot accurately determine how the person referred to as "he" fixed the computer. A corrected version of the sentence might be "How did John guess that the repairman fixed the computer?"
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("the committee"), a verb ("knows"), and an object clause ("whose efforts to achieve peace the world should honor"). The relative pronoun "whose" refers back to an unspecified group or individual who has made efforts toward achieving peace. Overall, the sentence conveys a clear meaning without any grammatical errors.
0	The sentence is missing a question mark at the end to indicate that it is a question. The corrected version of the sentence would be: "Which house does your friend live?"
1	The sentence "the baker from whom I bought these bagels left" is grammatically correct. It uses a relative clause ("from whom I bought these bagels") to modify the noun phrase "the baker." This construction is formal but still commonly used in written English.
1	The sentence "I found the place where we can relax." is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "I" which is a pronoun used as the subject of the verb "found". The verb "found" agrees with its singular subject "I", so there is no error related to subject-verb agreement. Additionally, the object of the verb "found" is "the place", which is followed by the prepositional phrase "where we can relax". This prepositional phrase functions as an adjective describing the noun "place". Overall, the structure and syntax of this sentence follow standard English rules for grammar and usage, making it a grammatically correct statement.
0	The sentence contains a redundant preposition. The phrase "with whom" already indicates that Jenny fell in love with someone, so there's no need to include the additional "with." A corrected version of the sentence would be: "Jack is the person whom Jenny fell in love." However, it is more common to say "Jack is the one Jenny fell in love with," or simply "Jack is the person Jenny fell in love with."
1	The sentence "There is a bench to sit on" is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("a bench"), a helping verb ("is"), and a predicate adjective ("to sit on"). The phrase "to sit on" functions as an adjectival prepositional phrase that modifies the noun "bench." This construction allows for clear meaning, making it a valid sentence in English.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "I", which is the person performing the action. The verb is "met", which describes the action being performed. The object of the sentence is "the man", which is the receiver of the action. The phrase "who grows peaches" is a relative clause that modifies "the man". It tells us more about his identity by explaining what he does for a living.
0	The sentence contains a minor error in subject-verb agreement. The subject of the sentence is "you," which is singular, but the verb "did get" is in the past tense of a helping verb followed by a past participle, as if it were plural. To fix the error, change the verb to "did get" or rephrase the sentence so that the subject and verb agree in number (e.g., "Which topics did you choose without getting his approval?").
0	The sentence contains a pronoun ambiguity error. It's unclear whether "you" refers to the speaker or the listener. Additionally, there is no verb agreement issue between the singular subject ("topic") and the plural predicate ("talked"). A corrected version could be: "Which topic did you get bored of because Mary talked too much about it?"
1	The sentence "That is the reason why he resigned" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "that," which refers to something previously mentioned or understood. The verb "is" agrees with the singular subject "that." The phrase "the reason why" functions as a noun clause that modifies "that," explaining why the subject resigned. Finally, the past tense verb "resigned" correctly describes the action completed by the subject. Therefore, there are no grammatical errors in this sentence.
1	The sentence "It bothers me that John coughs" is grammatically correct. Here's a breakdown of why it works: * "It" serves as a dummy subject, which is common in sentences expressing feelings or experiences (e.g., "it rains," "it snows"). * "bothers" is a verb indicating that something has a negative impact on the speaker's emotions. * "me" is the object of the verb "bothers." * "that" introduces a subordinate clause. * "John" is the subject of the subordinate clause. * "coughs" is the third-person present tense form of the verb "to cough," which agrees with the subject "John."
0	The verb "to please" should be followed by a subject and a base form of the verb, but here it's followed by a noun ("John"). A correct sentence would be "It is easy to please John." or "Pleaseing John is easy." (although the latter sounds quite formal).
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Kim," who is described as being eager using the adjective "eager." The verb of the sentence is "is," which connects the subject to its complement, "to please Tom." Both "Tom" and "please" are correctly used here. Overall, the sentence has a clear structure and follows standard English grammar rules.
1	The sentence "That we invaded Iraq really bites" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is the clause "that we invaded Iraq," which functions as the direct object of the verb "bites." Although it might seem unusual to describe a historical event as something that "bites," there's nothing inherently ungrammatical about using a colloquial expression in this way. In fact, such usage can be quite effective for conveying emotion or making a point.
0	The sentence contains a grammatical error. In the subject-verb agreement, the verb must agree in number with the subject. Here, the subject "it" is singular, but the verb used after it, "annoy," is plural. A correction could be made by changing the verb to its singular form, such as "It annoys me that Fido barks." or altering the subject to match the plural verb, for example, "Those things annoy me, that Fido barks so much."
1	The sentence "Who achieved the best result was Angela." is grammatically correct. Here's why: * The subject of the sentence is a relative clause "who achieved the best result," which functions as the nominal subject of the sentence. It agrees with the linking verb "was" in number (singular). * The predicate nominative "Angela" correctly refers to the same person as the relative pronoun "who". * There are no grammatical errors such as incorrect word order, missing words, or misspelled words in the sentence. Therefore, it is a complete and grammatically correct sentence.
1	The sentence "It was the peasant girl who got it" is grammatically correct. Here's a breakdown of why: - "It was" forms a complete predicate, acting as a linking verb that connects the subject to additional information about it (known as a subject complement). - "The peasant girl" is the grammatical subject, which is clear and unambiguous. - "who" introduces a relative clause modifying the noun phrase "the peasant girl," making the meaning more precise by specifying which particular peasant girl we're talking about. - "got" is the past tense form of "get," indicating that the action took place in the past. - "it" refers back to some previously mentioned idea or object; without context, its specific referent may be ambiguous, but syntactically, there's no problem here. Overall, all elements fit together coherently in terms of syntax, morphology, and semantics, so I would classify this sentence as being grammatically correct.
0	The sentence contains a couple of errors. First, instead of "That kind of person," it should be "A person of that kind." Second, "anyone" should be replaced by "someone." Finally, there's no need for two articles ("a" and "to") before the infinitive verb phrase; only one article should remain. A corrected version would read as follows: "A person of that kind is hard to find someone to look after."
1	The sentence "A sick owl doesn't hunt mice." is grammatically correct. It follows the standard structure of a simple declarative sentence with a subject ("a sick owl"), an auxiliary verb ("doesn't"), and a predicate ("hunt mice")." affair "with"). Additionally, all words are spelled correctly, and there are no punctuation errors or misplaced modifiers. Therefore, I would classify this sentence as being grammatically correct.
1	The sentence appears grammatically correct. It uses proper subject-verb agreement ("who has" matches singular "candidate"), appropriate verb tense (present participle "having" correctly modifies the noun), and a clear structure that conveys meaning without ambiguity or error.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It contains a clause ("whose contribution is written in any language other than English") that modifies the subject of the sentence ("each author"). This type of construction is called a relative clause, which provides additional information about the noun it modifies. In this case, the relative pronoun "whose" refers to "author," indicating that the contribution being referred to belongs to each author mentioned in the sentence. Overall, the structure and grammar of the sentence are clear and coherent, so I would rate it as correct.
0	The sentence contains a common error of word usage. The phrase "even we got" suggests that getting the tickets was surprising or unexpected for both parties involved, but the use of "even" here is incorrect because it implies a contrast that doesn't exist in this context. A better way to express this idea would be "I'm sure we have these tickets!" or "We must have these tickets!"
0	The sentence contains a contraction error. It should be "I'm not even sure if/whether we have gotten these tickets!" or "I'm not even certain that we have these tickets." instead of "I'm even sure we got these tickets!" In written English, it is more appropriate to use full forms rather than contractions for clarity. Additionally, there needs to be some form of negation (not, never, etc.) before "even" when used in this context.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There is a clear subject ("I"), verb ("helped"), and object ("him"). Additionally, the clause "that I have any sympathy for urban guerillas" provides additional information about the speaker's motivations without interrupting the flow of the sentence. Overall, there are no grammatical errors or awkward constructions in this sentence.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The clause "it isn't because..." sets up a negative cause-and-effect relationship, which is followed by the reason for the speaker's anger ("Sue said anything bad about me") and the consequence of that reason ("I'm angry"). This structure creates a clear, logical flow to the sentence. Additionally, each word is spelled correctly, there are no punctuation errors, and subject-verb agreement is consistent throughout the sentence.
1	The sentence "That he was hungry, John whined" is grammatically correct. It contains two independent clauses ("that he was hungry" and "John whined") that are connected by a comma splice. Although it's generally recommended to use a conjunction or rephrase one of the clauses as a dependent clause when connecting two independent clauses, comma splicing is still considered grammatical even though it can sometimes result in unclear meaning or run-on sentences. However, in this case, the connection between both clauses is clear enough for us to understand their relationship without needing additional words.
0	The sentence contains two issues. Firstly, there should be a comma after "party" to separate the introductory phrase from the main clause (i.e., "I gave Mary after the party a book."). Secondly, we typically use "to" instead of "a" before the direct object when it's a person (i.e., "Mary" here) receiving something (i.e., "book"). A corrected version would read as follows: "I gave Mary a book after the party."
0	The second part of the sentence after the conjunction 'as for' should be a clause starting with a subject-verb pair, but here it starts with 'Mary', which is just a noun phrase without any verb following it. A corrected version would be 'Because she's so pleasant, as for me, I really like her.'
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the first clause is "he," which is a singular third-person pronoun. This matches the verb "hate" in the present tense. The second clause uses the idiomatic expression "it doesn't matter," which does not require any specific subject or agreement with another part of the sentence. Therefore, there are no grammatical errors in this sentence.
0	The sentence contains a grammatical error known as subject-verb agreement. In the present tense, a singular subject requires a singular verb, while a plural subject requires a plural verb. Here, the subject "John" is singular, but the verb form used is "would be," which is plural. A grammatically correct version of the sentence could be "Without a job, John would not be happy."
0	The sentence contains a common error related to the use of determiners before uncountable nouns. For uncountable nouns such as 'manuscript,' we do not typically use 'much' but rather 'a lot (of).' A corrected version would be: "I have a lot of the manuscript left to type."
1	The sentence "He's a more reliable man" is grammatically correct. The contraction "he's" is used as a present tense verb form of "to be," which agrees with its subject "he." The comparative adjective "more" modifies the adjective "reliable," indicating that he is compared to someone or something else in terms of reliability. Finally, the article "a" precedes the noun "man," making it clear we are introducing a specific individual who has the quality of being reliable.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "any trouble," which is a noun clause acting as the direct object. It is followed by "is" (the linking verb), and "what I don't want" describes or renames the subject. This construction creates a proper sentence that can be used in various contexts to express dislike for problems or issues.
1	The sentence "They may grow as high as bamboo" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "They" refers to a plural subject that has been mentioned or implied earlier in the conversation. It could be people, animals, or objects. * "may grow" indicates possibility or uncertainty about whether they will actually reach a certain height. * "as high as" is used here to compare their potential height to something else (in this case, bamboo). * "bamboo" functions as a noun adjunct, modifying "high" by specifying what it's being compared to. So overall, each word in the sentence contributes appropriately to its meaning and structure.
0	The sentence contains two grammatical errors. Firstly, there should be a possessive apostrophe after some to indicate possession (i.e., "Some's"). Secondly, the word "errors" should agree with the plural subject "some," so it should read "as many errors as they had made." Therefore, the corrected sentence would be: "Some made as many errors as they had made."
0	The pronoun "himself" is a reflexive pronoun that refers back to the subject of the sentence. In this case, the subject is "Sally," which is a female name. Therefore, we need to use a reflexive pronoun that agrees in gender with the subject. Since "herself" is the feminine form of the reflexive pronoun, the corrected sentence should read: "Sally kissed herself."
1	The sentence "Drew believes I think Rosie loves magazine ads." is grammatically correct. There are no spelling errors or punctuation marks missing. Additionally, the word order follows standard English syntax rules. All of the verbs ("believes," "think," and "loves") agree with their respective subjects in terms of tense and number. Therefore, this sentence can be labeled as grammatically correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It contains a list of names followed by a verb ("left") which indicates that they have all departed together. Each name is separated by a comma except for the last two, where we use "and" to connect them as per standard English punctuation rules.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("we"), a verb ("will make"), and an adverbial clause of time ("without snow") that indicates when the action will take place. Additionally, there is an auxiliary verb ("will") used to express future tense which agrees with the subject "we". The word "through" is correctly used here as a preposition indicating duration or completion. Overall, the structure and usage of words follow standard English grammar rules.
0	The subject of the second clause ("Betsy is pretty") is "Betsy," which requires a singular verb form to agree in number. However, the verb phrase used here is "shows herself," which is grammatically incorrect because it uses a third-person singular verb form but refers to a plural noun ("leather"). A possible correction could be: "Blue leather reveals how pretty Betsy is."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject "Gwen" is clearly identified as the one performing the action, which is expressed by the verb "hit." Additionally, we have a direct object "the baseball," which tells us what was hit. There are no grammatical errors or awkward phrasings that would make it difficult to understand the intended meaning of this sentence.
0	The sentence contains a grammatical error. It should be "I think you know the answer" instead of "I hit that you knew the answer." In my explanation, "hit" was mistakenly used instead of "think," which highlights the importance of proofreading for errors before making a statement.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It uses the correlative conjunction "or" to connect two independent clauses, each of which has a subject ("I") and a verb ("have lost"). The meaning of the sentence implies that the speaker has experienced one of these two situations, but it doesn't specify which one.
1	The sentence "It was a brand new car that he bought" is grammatically correct. Here's why: - The subject of the sentence is "it," which refers to the car being described. - The verb "was" agrees with the singular subject "it." - An adjective phrase "brand new" modifies the noun "car." - A relative clause "that he bought" gives more information about the car. - Overall, the word order follows standard English syntax rules.
1	The sentence "He likes cookies and he hates crumb cake." is grammatically correct. Each clause contains a subject ("he") and a verb ("likes" and "hates"), and they're connected by the conjunction "and". Additionally, both clauses have complete thoughts, making the sentence clear and easy to understand.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The verb "chased" agrees with its subject "they," and the prepositional phrase "with the car" modifies how or by what means the action was performed.
1	The sentence "I didn't have a red cent" is grammatically correct. It is an idiomatic expression that means the speaker had no money.
0	The sentence "the book of poems and from Blackwell takes a very long time to read" contains multiple errors that make it difficult for native speakers to understand its intended meaning. Here's how we can break down the issues: * There is no clear subject or verb at the beginning of the sentence, making it unclear what is taking a long time to read. * "and from Blackwell" seems out of place in the middle of the sentence. It might be trying to indicate where the book was purchased, but if so, it needs better integration into the sentence structure. * Overall, the sentence lacks proper punctuation and capitalization, which further obscures its meaning. To fix these issues, one possible revision could be: "Reading the book of poems from Blackwell takes a very long time."
1	The sentence "the one with a red cover takes a very long time to read" is grammatically correct. There are no spelling errors or punctuation issues. Additionally, the word order follows standard English syntax rules, making it easy for native speakers to understand. Therefore, I would classify this as a correct sentence.
1	The sentence "John has a fear of dogs" is grammatically correct. The subject "John" is followed by the verb "has," which indicates possession, and the object of his fear, "dogs." All elements are used correctly and there are no spelling or punctuation errors.
0	In this sentence, we have a subject ("the building") and a verb ("is"), but the object of the sentence is incorrect. Instead of saying "The building's **the** roof is leaking," it should be "The building's **roof** is leaking." This change makes the subject (building) and its modifier (roof) agree grammatically.
0	The adjective "dark" is redundant because "black" already implies a very high level of darkness. Also, there needs to be a connector between "panther's" and "coat". A corrected version would read as follows: "The panther's coat is black."
1	The sentence "Colin asked if they could get a mortgage" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "Colin" is the subject of the sentence, and it is singular and in the third person. It agrees with the verb "asked." * "if they could get a mortgage" is a subordinate clause that functions as the direct object of the main clause. It contains the auxiliary verb "could," which agrees with the plural pronoun "they." * The word order is correct for a question, with the auxiliary verb coming before the subject ("if they could") and the main verb following the subject ("get"). * There are no spelling or punctuation errors.
0	This sentence is grammatically incorrect because it implies that two separate events are being described by a single subject ("the man I saw") - seeing someone getting into a taxi and committing a robbery. However, the tense of the verbs suggests that these two actions occurred simultaneously or consecutively, which cannot be true if the speaker only recognized the person as having committed the crime after observing them enter the taxi. A corrected version could read: "The man who got into the cab that I saw robbed the bank."
1	The sentence "I know you eat asparagus." is grammatically correct. Here's a breakdown of why: - "I" is a first-person singular pronoun used correctly to refer to the speaker. - "know" is a verb that indicates knowledge or awareness on the part of the subject (in this case, "I"). It agrees with the subject in number and person. - "you" is a second-person singular pronoun used correctly to address the listener. - "eat" is a verb indicating past or present tense habitual action by the subject ("you") towards the object ("asparagus"). It agrees with the subject in number. - "asparagus" is a noun functioning as the direct object of the verb "eat," receiving the action of the verb. Its plural form is appropriate because it can be eaten one stalk at a time. Overall, all elements of the sentence fit together well without grammatical errors.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "John's drum," which is a possessive noun that shows ownership or association. The verb "will always bother" correctly agrees with the singular subject "drum." Finally, the object of the sentence is "me." Therefore, there are no grammatical errors in this sentence.
1	The sentence "An evil thought struck Dave" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "Evil" is a adjective describing the noun "thought." * "Struck" is the past tense of the verb "strike," which means to hit or affect someone suddenly. In this context, it implies that Dave was suddenly affected by an evil thought. * The subject-verb agreement is also correct - "an evil thought" (singular) agrees with the singular form of the verb "struck." Overall, the sentence has a clear structure and uses standard English grammar rules correctly.
1	The sentence "In the classroom John put the book on the table." is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("John"), a verb ("put") that agrees with the subject in number (singular), and an object of the preposition ("the table"). Additionally, the sentence order follows standard English syntax rules.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence, "Phillip," is doing the action of giving something (the object, which is "the medal") to someone (the indirect object, which is "the soldier"). There are no grammatical errors or awkward phrasing in this sentence.
0	The verb tense in this sentence is incorrect. It should be "Andy eats" instead of "Andy to eat." Also, there should be a preposition between "thinks" and "Andy," such as "that" or "whether." Here's how it could be corrected: Heidi thinks that Andy eats salmon-flavored candy bars.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Heidi," who is thinking something about someone else (Andy). The verb "thinks" agrees with the singular subject "Heidi." The subordinate clause "that Andy should eat salmon flavored candy bars" contains a suggestion from Heidi to Andy about what he should consume. Each word is spelled correctly, punctuation marks are used appropriately, and there are no awkward or confusing phrasings. Overall, it's a well-constructed sentence.
1	The sentence "He danced" is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple sentence with a subject ("he") and a verb ("danced"). Both the subject and verb agree in number (singular), making the sentence grammatical.
0	The sentence "Did Calvin his homework?" is incorrect because it lacks proper verb agreement. In English, when using auxiliary verbs such as "do" or "did," the base form of the main verb follows the subject, so the correct version would be "Did Calvin do his homework?"
1	The sentence "Sylvia was slapping Jeff upside the head in martial arts class" is grammatically correct. It contains a complete thought and follows the rules of subject-verb agreement, word order, and tense consistency. Additionally, all words are spelled correctly, and there are no punctuation errors. Therefore, I would rate this sentence as grammatically correct and assign it a score of 1.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The conditional structure "if + past simple, would + infinitive" is used to express hypothetical or unlikely conditions in the present or future. In this case, "If I am a rich man" implies that the speaker is currently not rich but imagines what they would do if they were. Therefore, there is no error in the grammar or usage of language.
1	The sentence "If he were a rich man, he'd buy a diamond ring." is grammatically correct. This is a type II conditional sentence which describes an unlikely or impossible situation in the present or future. In such sentences, we use past simple (or past continuous) after 'if', and would + infinitive for the main clause. Here, 'were' is used instead of 'was' because it refers to a hypothetical condition.
1	The sentence "John is likely to leave" is grammatically correct. Here's why: - "John" is a proper noun that refers to a person, so it is being used correctly as the subject of the sentence. - "is likely" is a verb phrase indicating possibility or expectation, which modifies the main verb "leave." This construction is often used when expressing predictions about future events based on current evidence or information. - "to leave" is an infinitive form of the verb "leave," which serves as the main action of the sentence. Overall, the sentence has a clear structure and follows standard rules for word order and usage, making it grammatically sound.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It consists of a subject ("the manager") and a verb ("laughed"). The verb agrees with the singular subject in number. There are no spelling errors or awkward phrasings to correct.
0	This sentence is missing a subject, which is necessary for it to be grammatically complete. The corrected version of the sentence could be something like "The ship was sunk," or any other noun that makes sense in context.
0	The sentence contains a common grammatical error known as a tense shift. In this case, the verb "think" is in the past tense (you **thought**), while the verb "kissed" is in the past perfect tense (had **kissed**). To fix the error, both verbs should be in the same tense. Here's one possible correction: "Who do you think kissed the gorilla?" This version uses the present tense for both verbs. Alternatively, if the speaker is referring to a specific instance of someone kissing the gorilla that has already been mentioned or established, it would be appropriate to use the past perfect tense for both verbs: "Who had you thought had kissed the gorilla?" However, without additional context, it is difficult to determine which tense is most appropriate.
1	The sentence “Have you seen my model airplane collection?” is grammatically correct. The auxiliary verb “have” is used correctly as a helping verb to form a question, and it agrees with the subject “you.” The word “my” functions appropriately as a possessive adjective modifying the noun “collection,” which is also used correctly. All other elements of the sentence are also grammatically sound.
1	The sentence "It seems that Lucy was mugged" is grammatically correct. Here's a breakdown of why it's correct: - "It seems" is used here as a impersonal subject followed by a linking verb. This construction introduces a statement or idea that has some level of uncertainty or probability associated with it. - "that" is a conjunction introducing a subordinate clause. In this case, the subordinate clause functions as the direct object of the sentence. - "Lucy" is a proper noun serving as the subject of the subordinate clause. - "was mugged" is the past tense of the passive voice form of the verb phrase. Since the action happened to someone else (in this case, Lucy), using the passive voice is appropriate. Overall, all parts of speech are correctly used together and no grammar rules have been violated; therefore, I would classify this sentence as being grammatically correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "I", which is the person who performed the action. The verb is "ate", which describes the action taken by the subject. The object of the sentence is "a salad", which receives the action of being eaten. Finally, the phrase "that was filled with lima beans" provides additional information about the salad, explaining what it contained. All of these elements work together to form a complete, grammatically correct sentence.
1	The sentence "There were four men arriving at the station when I pulled up" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "There were" is a correctly used verb tense to indicate past plural existence of something (in this case, "four men"). * "Four men" is a properly constructed noun phrase that includes both a determiner ("four") and a plural noun ("men"). * "Arriving" is a gerund form of the verb "arrive," which functions as an adjective here, modifying "men." It indicates the ongoing nature of their arrival at the time of my pulling up. * "At the station" is a prepositional phrase indicating location where the action took place. * "When I pulled up" is a subordinate clause that provides temporal context for the main clause. It uses the past tense appropriately. Overall, all elements combine to make a coherent and grammatically sound sentence!
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Jean," which is a noun in the third person singular form. The verb "is" agrees with the subject in number and person, as it is also in the third person singular form. Additionally, the infinitive phrase "to dance" correctly follows the verb "reluctant."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "I", which is implied rather than explicitly stated. The verb is "want", and it is followed by its direct object "her". After that, we have the infinitive phrase "to dance" serving as the complement of the sentence. An infinitive (in this case, "dance") functions as a noun in a sentence; thus, there's no need for a separate subject or verb within the infinitive phrase itself.
1	The sentence "Jean persuaded Robert" is grammatically correct. It consists of a subject (Jean), a verb (persuaded), and an object (Robert). There are no spelling or punctuation errors, and the word order follows standard English syntax rules.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Jean," and the verb is "wants." The verb agrees with the subject in number (both are singular), which shows that the sentence is constructed properly according to its syntax rules. Additionally, there is a clear direct object ("Bill") and infinitive phrase ("to do the Macarena"), both separated by prepositions. Overall, it's a well-constructed sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "the children," which is plural. The verb that agrees with a plural subject is also plural ("admire"). Additionally, the object of the verb is "their mother," which refers to someone who has children, making it appropriate for this context.
1	The sentence "Who has Peter talked with?" is grammatically correct. It is a question asking about who Peter had a conversation with. In this sentence, "who" serves as the subject, "has" is an auxiliary verb used to form present perfect tense, "Peter" is the object of the preposition "with", and "talked" is the past participle of the verb "to talk".
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence, "Heidi," is a proper noun that is singular. It is followed by the verb "likes" which agrees with the subject in number (third person singular) and is in the present tense. After the verb we have the object "her violin", where "her" is a possessive determiner used to indicate ownership or association, and "violin" is a countable noun in its singular form. Therefore, there are no grammatical errors in this sentence.
0	The pronoun "himself" does not agree with its antecedent "Mary." Since Mary is a female, the correct form of the reflexive pronoun would be "herself," so the correct sentence is "John thinks that Mary loves herself."
0	The sentence contains a minor error in its use of possessive pronouns. It should be "Which pictures of him does John like?" instead because we use object forms (me, you, him, her, it, them) after verbs such as 'like'.
0	The sentence contains a grammatical error. The word 'any' should be replaced with 'an', as it follows the vowel sound of the letter 'o'. Additionally, the verb tense should agree with the subject; since 'owl' is singular, we need to use the third person present tense form of the verb 'hunt': "An owl hunts mice."
0	This sentence contains a double negative ("didn't" and "any"), which can result in a positive meaning when it should be negative. A better way to phrase the sentence would be "No man ate dinner." Alternatively, if the intent was to convey that there was at least one man who did not eat dinner, the sentence could be rephrased as "Not every man ate dinner."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The auxiliary verb "could" is used correctly to indicate possibility in the past or present. The subject-verb agreement is also correct as "pilot" (singular) matches with "could" (singular). Additionally, the article "a" is appropriately used before "pilot."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. Here's a breakdown of why: * "Everybody" refers to an unspecified number of people, typically implying a large group. It is followed by a relative clause "who attended last week's huge rally," which modifies everybody and provides additional information about them. This usage is perfectly acceptable. * "Whoever they were" serves as another way to refer to those same individuals mentioned earlier, emphasizing their identity or role rather than specifying it directly. Again, this construction is used correctly. * Finally, we have "signed the petition." Since signing petitions is something that individuals do, using the plural verb form ("sign") makes sense here. Therefore, there are no grammatical errors in this part either. In conclusion, all parts of this sentence work together smoothly without causing any confusion or violating rules of standard written English. Hence, I would rate this sentence as 1 for being grammatically correct.
1	The sentence "Anybody who attended last week's huge rally signed the petition" is grammatically correct. The subject-verb agreement is consistent throughout the sentence (anybody-attended; who-signed), and there are no obvious spelling or punctuation errors. Additionally, the use of participial phrases ("who attended") to modify a noun ("anybody") is also correct.
0	The subject of the sentence is "any tiger," which is a singular noun. However, the verb "has" that follows it is plural, indicating more than one tiger possessing something. To make this sentence grammatically correct, we need to use a singular verb form such as "has." A possible correction would be: "Any tiger has orange fur with black stripes."
0	Albinism in animals, including tigers, results in a lack of pigmentation, which gives them white fur, not orange as stated in the sentence. The rest of the sentence is grammatically correct but factually incorrect due to the misconception about albino tigers' fur color.
0	The sentence contains a common grammatical error known as a missing article. In this case, the word 'flower' requires either the definite article 'the' or an indefinite article ('a' or 'an') to be grammatically correct. A corrected version of the sentence could read "You must pick a flower you see" (if referring to just one arbitrary flower), or "You must pick the flower you see" (if there is only one specific flower being referred to).
1	The sentence "Any pilot on duty today could be flying this plane" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "Any" is used correctly as a determiner before the noun phrase "pilot on duty today." It indicates that any individual who fits the description of being a pilot on duty today has the possibility to fly the plane. * "Pilot" is a singular countable noun, and it agrees with its verb form "could be," which shows ability or possibility. * "On duty today" functions as a present participle phrase modifying "pilot," indicating their current work status. This phrase is set off by a pair of commas because it provides additional but nonessential information about the subject. * "Flying" is the gerund form of the verb functioning as the main predicate of the sentence. A gerund acts as a noun, so the pronoun "this" refers to the plane that someone (a pilot) might operate during flight. * Overall, the sentence structure follows standard English rules for grammar, punctuation, spelling, and usage.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the first clause is "you," which is implied rather than explicitly stated. The verb "may" indicates permission to perform the action described by the infinitive phrase "pick every flower." The conjunction "but" introduces a contrasting idea, namely that some flowers should be left for Mary. Both clauses follow standard English syntax rules, making this sentence grammatically sound.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It contains two independent clauses that are connected using a conjunction ("and"). Each clause has a subject ("the Dodgers" and "were") and a verb ("beat" and "beaten"), which makes it complete and clear for understanding. Additionally, there's no punctuation or agreement error, so overall, the sentence is written correctly.
1	The sentence "In which car was the man seen?" is grammatically correct. It consists of a prepositional phrase ("in which car") followed by the verb tense "was seen," indicating past passive voice. This structure allows for a question to be formed that seeks information about where the action took place (the location) rather than who performed the action or when it occurred.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. Here's a breakdown of its structure: * The subject of the sentence is "the man." * "Who" introduces a relative clause modifying the noun "man," which tells us more about his identity (i.e., he is the person whom Mary loves and Sally hates). * "Loves" and "hates" are both verb phrases that describe the actions of two different subjects ("Mary" and "Sally"). These verbs are connected by the conjunction "and." * "Computed" is the main verb phrase describing what the man did to the speaker (calculated their taxes). Overall, the sentence has a clear subject-verb agreement and uses appropriate punctuation marks, so it is grammatical.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. There are no spelling errors or punctuation marks missing. Also, the structure of the sentence follows standard English grammar rules. Specifically, it contains a subject ("the kennel"), a verb ("has been stolen"), and additional information about the subject provided by two relative clauses ("which Mary made" and "and Fido sleeps"). These elements work together to convey a clear meaning that is easy for native speakers to understand.
1	The sentence "Tom said he would and Bill actually did eat a raw eggplant" is grammatically correct. In this sentence, both simple subjects ("Tom" and "Bill") have corresponding verb phrases that express separate actions in past tense: "said he would" (a contraction of "would say," indicating future-in-past) and "did eat." Also, there's no punctuation or agreement error in this sentence. Therefore, it can be considered as a proper sentence without any grammatical issues.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("the wealthy young man"), a verb ("bought"), and an object ("that piano"). Additionally, it includes necessary prepositions to convey additional information about the action taking place. Finally, there are no apparent spelling or punctuation errors.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It consists of a noun phrase ("the dog") followed by a verb phrase ("stole the turkey"). Both phrases contain appropriate determiners (the), nouns (dog, turkey) and tense marking on the verb (stole). There are no missing or extra words, and all elements agree with each other in number and person.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It consists of a noun phrase ("a tall building") which contains both a determiner ("a") and an adjective ("tall"). The structure and word choice here are appropriate for standard English usage.
1	The sentence "This building is tall" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence, "this building," is singular, so the verb must also be singular. In this case, the verb "is" agrees with the singular subject "building." Additionally, there are no obvious spelling or punctuation errors in the sentence. Therefore, it can be considered a grammatically correct sentence.
1	The sentence "I like the book which you gave me." is grammatically correct. In this sentence, the subject is "I", the verb is "like", and the direct object is "the book". The relative clause "which you gave me" modifies the noun phrase "the book". This type of subordinate clause often begins with a relative pronoun such as "who", "whom", or "that", but it can also begin with a relative adverb such as "where" or "when", depending on what information is being provided about the head noun (in this case, "book"). Here, the relative clause provides additional context by indicating that the speaker likes the specific book that was given to them by someone else. Overall, there are no grammatical errors in this sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("Captain Wentworth"), a verb ("wrote"), and an object ("a letter to Anne Elliott"). The sentence follows standard English syntax rules and there are no spelling or punctuation errors present.
0	The verb tense is incorrect in this sentence. It should be "She asked if Alison was coming to the party." Instead of using "was" after "if," it should come before "Alison" because "asked" is already in the past tense.
1	The sentence "They realized that never had Sir Thomas been so offended" is grammatically correct. It uses a verb tense (the past perfect) to indicate that an action was completed before another action took place in the past. In this case, the action of Sir Thomas being offended happened before they realized it. This use of verb tenses helps create clarity about the sequence of events and is therefore grammatically correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Fanny," which is followed by a verb tense that indicates past regret, "regretted." The phrase "having to talk" functions as a gerund phrase acting as the direct object of the sentence. Lastly, we have "to Aunt Norris," which is a prepositional phrase telling us who Fanny had to talk to.
1	The sentence "Knowing the country well, he took a short cut" is grammatically correct. There is no punctuation error or any mistake related to subject-verb agreement, verb tense consistency, pronoun reference, word choice, etc. Therefore, it can be concluded that the sentence is a proper one.
1	The sentence "He left the train with somebody else's wallet in his pocket." is grammatically correct. It contains a simple sentence with one independent clause "he left the train" and one dependent clause "with somebody else's wallet in his pocket". Both clauses are correctly constructed, using proper verb forms and word order. Additionally, all words are spelled and used correctly, making the overall structure of the sentence clear and easy to understand.
1	The sentence "Magnus went to Ireland" is grammatically correct. It consists of a proper noun ("Magnus") as the subject, followed by the verb "went," which agrees with the singular subject in tense (past), and "to Ireland," a prepositional phrase that functions as the destination complement for the action described by the verb. All elements contribute appropriately to meaning, making it a complete and accurate sentence.
0	The sentence is missing a preposition after "send." A correct version would be "Who did John send the book to?" or "To whom did John send the book?"
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It contains a simple subject ("the idea") and predicate ("dismayed the Prime Minister"), followed by an independent clause introduced by the conjunction "that." In addition, it uses appropriate verb tense (past tense) to express a completed action. Overall, the structure of the sentence is clear and easy to understand, making it grammatically sound.
0	In this sentence, there is no auxiliary verb to support the subject-verb agreement in the clause "he did." The corrected version of the sentence would be "He came right in without so much as a knock" or "Right in he came without so much as a knock," where the subject ("he") and the verb ("came"/"is") agree in number (both singular).
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Harriet," which is a noun that refers to a person. The verb of the sentence is "admired," which indicates past tense action and agrees with the singular subject "Harriet." The object of the sentence is "Mr. Knightley," which is also a noun referring to a person. Overall, the sentence follows standard English grammar rules and has no errors.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It consists of a subject ("the book") and a predicate ("is boring"). The verb "is" agrees with its singular subject "book," and the adjective "boring" correctly modifies the noun. Therefore, there are no grammatical errors in this sentence.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no spelling errors or punctuation marks missing. Additionally, the word order is appropriate for a question, as it follows subject-verb agreement rules and uses proper verb tense ("wishes" indicates that she will be asking questions). All elements of the sentence flow well together, making it easy to understand Ethel's intentions.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Emma," who is performing the action of making food for someone named "Harriet." Both names are proper nouns, so they begin with capital letters, which is also grammatically correct. Additionally, the verb tense is appropriate for a completed action, as indicated by the past tense form of the verb "made."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "the window," which is singular. The verb that agrees with a singular subject is "was." The prepositional phrase "with a hammer" describes how the window was broken. Therefore, there are no grammatical errors in this sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The verb tense is consistent throughout the sentence (past tense), and all words are spelled correctly. Additionally, the sentence structure follows standard English rules, with a clear subject ("the fugitive") and predicate ("lay motionless in order to avoid discovery"). All punctuation marks are used appropriately as well.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "The" is a definite article that introduces a singular noun ("guard") which agrees with its verb "marched." * "Guard" is a common noun that functions as the subject of the sentence. It's performing the action denoted by the verb. * "March" is a regular verb in the simple past tense that denotes completed actions. In this case, it indicates that the guard moved rhythmically while walking around the prison yard. * "Prisoners" is a plural noun functioning as the direct object of the sentence. They receive the action from the verb through the intermediary preposition "round." * "Round" is a preposition indicating motion along a circular or looping path. It takes the objective form of the pronoun "them," which refers to the prisoners. * "Yard" is a proper noun that serves as the destination for the movement described by the verb phrase "marched round."
1	The sentence "Frank Churchill crossed the street" is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("Frank Churchill"), a verb ("crossed") and a direct object ("the street"). All of these elements agree in number (singular) and tense (past). There are no spelling or punctuation errors, so the sentence can be understood easily by native speakers of English.
1	The sentence "Emma and Harriet were attacked yesterday" is grammatically correct. It contains a clear subject ("Emma and Harriet") and verb tense that indicates past action ("were attacked"). Additionally, there are no misspelled words or incorrect punctuation marks. Therefore, it is a valid sentence in standard English.
1	The sentence "Fiona might be here by 5 o'clock" is grammatically correct. The modal verb "might" indicates possibility, and it agrees with the subject "Fiona." The adverbial phrase "by 5 o'clock" correctly modifies the verb phrase "be here," indicating when Fiona might arrive. Therefore, there are no grammatical errors or awkward constructions in this sentence.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It contains two independent clauses joined by the conjunction "and". Both clauses express the speaker's feelings about getting the job, making the meaning clear and concise.
1	The sentence “Pat was awarded the Golden Fleece Award and very upset about it” is grammatically correct. Here's why: - The subject of the sentence is "Pat," which is a proper noun and correctly capitalized. - The verb "was awarded" agrees with the singular subject "Pat." It also uses the past tense appropriately to indicate that the event occurred in the past. - "The Golden Fleece Award" is a noun phrase acting as the direct object of the sentence. It contains a determiner ("the") followed by two adjectives ("Golden" and "Fleece") modifying the head noun "Award." This structure is perfectly acceptable. - Finally, the conjunction "and" connects two independent clauses: "Pat was awarded the Golden Fleece Award" and "very upset about it." In both cases, there is a clear subject (Pat, it) and predicate (was awarded...; very upset...) making each clause complete. Therefore, no commas are needed around the conjunction since neither clause is nonessential or particularly long. Overall, the sentence follows standard English grammar rules, so I would classify it as correct.
0	The sentence contains two grammatical errors. Firstly, "alienating" should be used instead of "alienated" since the action is happening now rather than having already been completed. Secondly, "beating" should be replaced with a verb form that agrees with its subject; because the subject "he" was mentioned earlier in the sentence (even though it's implied here), we need to use a third-person singular verb conjugation such as "beats." A corrected version could read: "Kim is alienating cats and beating his dog." However, I would recommend against promoting or discussing violence towards animals.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject “they” agrees with the verb “knew.” Additionally, the subordinate clause “of each other would be on sale” modifies the noun phrase “pictures,” which serves as the direct object of the main clause. There are no grammatical errors or awkward phrasings in the sentence.
0	The sentence contains a pronoun "he" which refers to "Terry", but there's no antecedent for it in the sentence. It would be better to rephrase the sentence as follows: "Which paper(s) did Terry file without reading?" or "Terry filed some papers without reading them. Which ones were they?" This way, we avoid using the pronoun "he" altogether, making the sentence clearer and grammatically correct.
1	The sentence "I want to try and buy some whiskey" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "I" is a proper subject pronoun used as the subject of the sentence. * "want" is a verb that indicates desire or intent. It agrees with the subject "I." * "to try" is an infinitive phrase acting as an adverbial element modifying the main verb "want," indicating purpose or intention. * "and buy" forms a coordinated pair of verbs joined by the conjunction "and," expressing two actions performed sequentially or simultaneously. * "some" is a determiner used before the plural noun "whiskey." * "whiskey" is a countable singular noun referring to a type of alcoholic beverage distilled from fermented grain mash. Overall, the structure and word choice of the sentence make it clear and easy to understand.
0	The sentence contains a grammatical error. It should be "She goes to buy some whiskey" instead of "She goes and buying some whiskey." In the corrected version, "to" is used as an infinitive marker before the verb "buy," which indicates the purpose or intention of the action. Additionally, there should be no conjunction such as "and" between the subject ("she") and the main verb phrase ("goes").
0	In the present simple tense, when the subject of a sentence consists of two or more nouns connected by "and," we use a plural verb to agree with those nouns. Therefore, the correct form of the verb for the subject "Kim and Terry" should be "are." The corrected sentence would read as follows: "Kim and Terry are happy."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence, "Kim," is performing the action (giving), which is indicated by the verb "gave." The direct objects of the sentence ("a dollar" and "a dime") indicate who or what is receiving the action. Additionally, each object is followed by its recipient ("to Bobbie" and "to Jean"), clearly indicating who received what amount of money. Overall, the sentence has a clear structure and follows standard English grammar rules.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no spelling errors or misplaced words. Additionally, the sentence structure flows smoothly, making it easy to understand the intended meaning.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It contains two independent clauses that are connected by a coordinating conjunction ("and"). Each clause has a subject ("you" and "this girl in the red coat") and a predicate verb phrase ("put...on your desk before tomorrow"). Additionally, both subjects refer to different people who will perform the same action (place a picture of Bill on the speaker's desk), making the meaning clear and coherent.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("this girl in the red coat"), a verb ("will put"), and an object ("a picture of Bill"). Additionally, it uses proper tense (future) to indicate that the action has not yet occurred but will happen by tomorrow.
1	The sentence "Ann bought a first edition of Richard III for $1000." is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("Ann"), a verb ("bought"), an object ("a first edition of Richard III"), and a prepositional phrase ("for $1000") that modifies the verb. Additionally, capitalization and punctuation rules have been followed correctly. Therefore, I would classify this sentence as being grammatically correct.
1	The sentence "John became deadly afraid of flying" is grammatically correct. The word "deadly" is used here as an adverb to describe the intensity of John's fear. It means that John became extremely or intensely afraid of flying. Therefore, there are no grammatical errors in this sentence.
1	The sentence "What John promised is to be gentle" is grammatically correct, but it may seem a bit awkward or unnatural because of its structure. A more common way to phrase this idea might be "John promised to be gentle." However, the original sentence is still technically valid, so I will give it a score of 1.
0	The sentence contains a small error known as a grammatical agreement issue. In the question, it asks "which books" instead of "what books." When referring to singular nouns such as "book," we use "what." For plural nouns like "books," we use "which." Therefore, the corrected version would be: "Henri wants to buy what books about cooking?"
1	The sentence "I will fix the computer for Carol." is grammatically correct. It has a clear subject ("I"), helping verb ("will"), main verb ("fix"), object ("the computer") and prepositional phrase ("for Carol"). All of these elements work together to form a complete thought that can be understood easily by native speakers of English.
1	The sentence "Smith loaned a valuable collection of manuscripts to the library" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Smith," which is the person who performed the action. The verb is "loaned," which indicates that Smith gave something (a valuable collection of manuscripts) to someone (the library). Both the subject and verb agree in number, as they both refer to singular entities. Additionally, the object of the preposition "to" is "the library." Overall, there are no grammatical errors or awkward phrasings in this sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It contains a simple subject ("the paper") and a predicate indicating that some action was done to it ("is cut"). Additionally, we have an agent of the action indicated by the verb phrase through the use of "by" followed by "Mary." Therefore, there are no errors in this sentence.
1	The sentence "It was from six to nine or it took place from six to nine" is grammatically correct. Both clauses of the sentence are independent clauses that can stand alone as separate sentences. They are connected by the coordinating conjunction "or," which shows a choice between two alternatives. Additionally, the prepositional phrases "from six to nine" correctly indicate time. Overall, the sentence structure is clear, concise, and proper for standard written English.
1	The sentence "Suddenly, there arrived two inspectors from the INS" is grammatically correct. However, it might sound more natural to native speakers if it were phrased as follows: "Suddenly, two inspectors from the INS arrived." Nonetheless, both versions of the sentence are technically correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It consists of two independent clauses ("The soup cooks" and "thickens") that are connected by a comma, which follows the serial (or Oxford) comma rule since there are three or more items listed in the sentence. Additionally, each clause has a subject and a verb, so they can stand alone as separate sentences if needed.
1	The sentence "I gave money to the charity" is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("I"), an auxiliary verb ("gave", past tense of "give"), the direct object ("money") and the indirect object ("the charity"). All words are spelled correctly, and there are no punctuation errors or awkward phrasings.
1	The sentence "John asked." is grammatically correct. It consists of a proper noun (John) followed by a verb in past tense (asked). There is no missing punctuation or any other error that would make it incorrect.
0	The sentence "I saw even the student" is grammatically incorrect because of misuse of the word 'even'. Here, it seems to be used for emphasis without a proper context or comparison. An appropriate usage could be something like "I saw even the quietest student laughing". In its current form, however, there's no clear reference point against which the speaker claims to have seen 'the student', making the sentence unclear if not outright wrong.
0	This sentence is grammatically incorrect because it lacks a main verb. The sentence implies that "John" whispered something about "Mary leaving," but it does not explicitly state what happened to "Mary." To make the sentence clearer and more grammatical, we could say "John whispered that Mary had left" or "John whispered to Mary as she was leaving."
0	In English, we typically use a conjunction such as "if" or "whether" to introduce a noun clause expressing doubt or uncertainty about a future event. The sentence "Mary wonders if Bill will come" would be grammatically correct because it uses the conjunction "if." Alternatively, one could say "Mary wonders whether Bill will come," which also utilizes a proper construction for indicating uncertainty. Therefore, without a necessary word such as "if" or "whether," the original sentence does not conform to standard English usage.
0	The verb "will" indicates future tense, but there's no appropriate main verb following it. It seems that the intended verb might be "go," as in "Sophie will go to the theater." Alternatively, if the intent was for Sophie to perform at a theater, the correction could be "Sophie will theater**(dance/act)**, or simply rephrasing the statement such as "Sophie will perform at the theater."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of both clauses is "John," who is performing two actions (finishing the cake and drinking the lemonade) through the use of a conjunction ("and") to link them together. Each verb agrees with its respective subject, making for proper concord. Additionally, there are no obvious spelling or punctuation errors present.
0	The pronoun "herself" is reflexive and typically refers back to another noun or pronoun in the same clause that has already been mentioned. However, in this sentence, there is no previous mention of a subject that would justify using "herself." A more appropriate way to phrase the sentence could be "She likes Mary's mother," or if it was necessary to emphasize that she herself (and not someone else) likes Mary's mother, one option might be "She herself has affection for Mary's mother."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "each of the boys," which is plural. The verb that agrees with a plural subject should also be plural, so "fought" is the correct form to use here. Additionally, the preposition "with" is used correctly to indicate that the boys were fighting against each other.
0	The pronoun used to refer back to the subject of a sentence should match its grammatical number and gender. In this case, "himself" is a reflexive pronoun that refers to a male singular noun, but it incorrectly follows the plural noun phrase "John's mother." Therefore, the correct form should be "John's mother likes him," or "He likes himself" if we want to emphasize self-liking.
0	The subject of the sentence "Mary" is female, but the pronoun used in the verb tense agreement is "himself," which is a reflexive pronoun for males. A more grammatically correct version would be "Mary revealed herself to John."
1	The sentence "Mary believes that Bill saw himself" is grammatically correct. Here's a breakdown of why it works: * "Mary" is the subject of the main clause, serving as the agent who holds the belief. * "believes" is the verb in the present tense, indicating that Mary has an ongoing mental state regarding something unspecified (yet to be revealed). * There is a subordinating conjunction "that," which introduces a complement clause. * "Bill" is the subject of the subordinate clause, acting as the person who did the seeing. * "saw" is the past-tense verb, showing that the action took place before the time of speaking or reference. * "himself" is the reflexive pronoun referring back to "Bill." It indicates that Bill was both the seer and the one being seen. The structure and word choice create a clear and coherent meaning without any grammatical errors.
1	The sentence "John heard that they criticized themselves" is grammatically correct. Here's a breakdown of why: - "John": This is a proper noun, referring to a person named John. It is correctly used as the subject of the main clause. - "heard": This is the past tense of the verb "to hear." In this context, it indicates that John received information about something. - "that": This conjunction introduces a subordinate clause, which functions as the direct object of the verb "heard." - "they": This is a pronoun, serving as the subject of the subordinate clause. - "criticized": This is the past tense of the verb "to criticize," indicating that someone or something was evaluated negatively by them. - "themselves": This reflexive pronoun refers back to the subject of the subordinate clause (they), showing that the action of criticism was directed towards themselves. Overall, all elements of the sentence work together coherently without any grammatical errors, making it a valid English statement.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence, "Mary," is clearly identified, and the verb tense is consistent throughout. Additionally, the subordinate clause "that she is smart" provides additional information about what Mary thinks. Overall, the structure and grammar of this sentence are sound.
1	The sentence "Henry found that Bill is sad" is grammatically correct. In this sentence, "found" is used as a verb indicating perception or discovery, while "that" introduces a subordinate clause ("Bill is sad"). Both "found" and "is" agree in tense (past for "found," present for "is"), making the sentence grammatical.
0	The phrase "proud of" suggests that John has a positive feeling or admiration towards Mary. However, the word "considers" implies that John is making a judgment or evaluation about something. A more appropriate way to express this idea would be "John feels proud of Mary." Alternatively, if the original intention was for John to have a sense of self-satitude regarding his relationship with Mary, one could say "John takes pride in his relationship with Mary."
0	The correct form of the verb to be for the subject “you” when it's singular is always "are," so the correct sentence would be "You should sit there before." Therefore, the original sentence is incorrect.
1	The sentence "There is a nurse available" is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("a nurse"), a helping verb ("is") that agrees with the subject in number, and a predicate adjective ("available"). Additionally, there are no spelling or punctuation errors. Therefore, I would classify this sentence as being grammatically correct and assign it a score of 1.
0	The verb "hopes" requires a singular noun as its subject, but "everyone" is plural. Therefore, we need to use a plural form of the verb for grammatical agreement. Additionally, the indirect object pronoun "to" before the infinitive verb "sleep" can be omitted without changing the meaning of the sentence. A corrected version would read: "Everyone hopes that everyone sleeps."
1	The sentence "Everyone hopes that he will sleep" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "Everyone" is a singular pronoun used to refer to all people or things collectively. It requires a singular verb, which we have here ("hopes"). * The subordinating conjunction "that" introduces a clause expressing purpose or reason. In this case, it separates two independent clauses: "everyone hopes" and "he will sleep." * "He" refers to a single person (the subject of the second clause) who is expected to perform the action of sleeping. * The future tense is indicated by "will," signaling an expectation for something to happen later. Overall, each word in the sentence functions appropriately according to standard English usage rules.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It uses the past perfect tense ("remembered") to indicate that one action (Churchill remembering) happened before another action (Churchill giving the speech), which is appropriate for the intended meaning of the sentence. Additionally, the use of articles ("the" before "Blood," "Sweat," and "Tears") and subject-verb agreement are all correct.
0	The sentence contains a grammatical error. In the phrase "to shave himself," the reflexive pronoun "himself" refers to the subject of the main clause, which is "John." However, in this context, we need an object form for the third person singular masculine pronoun, so it should be "he" instead of "himself." A corrected version would read as follows: "John promised Mary to shave him." Alternatively, if we want to keep the meaning that John will do the shaving by himself, we could use the emphatic reflexive pronoun "himself" without changing anything else in the sentence: "John promised Mary to shave himself."
1	The sentence "John convinced Bill that Mary should sleep" is grammatically correct. It contains a main clause ("John convinced Bill") and a subordinate clause ("that Mary should sleep"). Both clauses contain simple tenses and follow the subject-verb-object word order. Additionally, the verb tense agrees within each clause (past tense for the main clause and modal verb "should" followed by base form of the verb "sleep" in the subordinate clause). All pronouns agree in number with their corresponding antecedents. Therefore, there are no grammatical errors in this sentence.
0	The sentence contains a coordinating conjunction ("while") that connects two independent clauses, but there is no comma before the conjunction. This makes the sentence difficult to read and understand because it's unclear whether "you did so" refers to what the speaker or someone else did. To fix this error, add a comma after "Bill": "I saw Bill, while you did so, Mary." However, even with the added comma, the sentence still sounds awkward and stilted due to the use of "so," which could be replaced by a more specific verb phrase for clarity and concision. For example: "I met Bill as you spoke to Mary."
0	The verb tense needs to be consistent throughout the sentence. In this case, "was" indicates that the action of giving happened in the past, but there's no clear subject for it. A corrected version could be: "What Mary did was give Bill a book." or "Mary's action was giving Bill a book."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple present tense verb ("sniffed") paired with its subject ("the bears"). No errors can be found regarding word choice, spelling, or punctuation.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no spelling errors or punctuation marks missing. Additionally, the subject-verb agreement is correct as well; both “to steal” and “is” agree with their respective subjects “you” (implied) and “the act of stealing.” All words used in context make sense, so there’s nothing confusing about it either.
0	The sentence "Anson demonized" is grammatically incomplete as it lacks a direct object or indirect object to complete its meaning. For example, one could say "Anson demonized the proposal," which would be grammatical and meaningful. Without additional context or information, however, I cannot assume what Anson might have demonized, so for now, I will assume that the original sentence was intended to stand alone without any further clarification. In such cases, we need a direct object or an indirect object to make sense of the verb used in a sentence. Therefore, the original sentence requires revision before it can be considered grammatically correct.
0	The verb "kick" requires a singular or plural noun as its subject, but "yourselves" is a reflexive pronoun that refers back to the subject of the sentence. In this case, since the subject "you" is already plural, there's no need for a reflexive pronoun, and using one can lead to confusion about who performed the action. A correct version could be simply "You kicked (something)."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "The book" is a noun phrase acting as the direct object of the verb "read." * "that I said that I'd never read" is a relative clause modifying the noun "book." It contains two instances of the conjunction "that," both of which introduce a complement clause after the verb "said" and "would never read." These clauses provide additional information about what was said regarding the book in question. Overall, the sentence structure is complex but well-formed, making it a grammatically correct sentence.
0	The verb "demonize" should have an object to complete its meaning, but there is no appropriate object in this sentence. Additionally, the phrase "up the Khyber" is unclear and does not make sense in this context. A corrected version could be "Anson demonized the evil forces in the Khyber."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. Here's why: * The subject of the sentence is "it," which refers to the implied statement "the possibility that I will go to the party." * The verb phrase "is not true" indicates a negative assertion about the truth of the implied statement. * The modal auxiliary verb "might" expresses possibility or uncertainty regarding the future action described by the infinitive phrase "going to the party." * Overall, the sentence conveys a denial of the possibility that the speaker will attend the party, using proper grammar and syntax.
0	The sentence "Kick you!" is grammatically incorrect because it lacks a subject (the person doing the kicking). A correct version of this sentence would be "Someone kicks you" or "He kicks you."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Jason," who is performing the action of persuading someone (the doctor). The verb "persuaded" is in the past tense, which agrees with the time frame established by the rest of the sentence. The indirect object is "the doctor," whom Jason is trying to convince about something. Finally, we have the infinitive phrase "to treat Medea," where "treat" serves as the main verb modified by "to." Overall, each part of the sentence functions properly and contributes to a clear meaning.
0	The sentence contains a small error that can be easily missed. It should be "Whom did you get an accurate description of?" or rephrased as "Who did you accurately describe?" instead. This is because when we use who/whom to ask about the subject of a clause (the person doing the action), it's usually who; but here, since we want to ask about the object (the one being described), whom would be more appropriate. However, many native speakers don't always follow this rule strictly in informal contexts, which might have led to the original sentence formation. Nonetheless, for formal writing, I recommend using the grammatically correct version.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "The Peter" is a valid noun phrase. Although it might sound more natural to say "Peter," using "the" before a proper name can be done for emphasis or if the person being referred to has already been mentioned earlier in the conversation. * "we all like" is a verb phrase that describes the subject of the sentence (in this case, "The Peter"). It consists of the auxiliary verb "do" (implied here), the subject pronoun "we," and the past tense form of the verb "like." * "was at the party" is another verb phrase that describes where the subject ("The Peter") was located during some unspecified time in the past. It consists of the linking verb "was" and the prepositional phrase "at the party." Overall, the sentence is clear and easy to understand, making it grammatically correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. Here's why: - The subject of the sentence is "the government," which is singular. - The verb that agrees with the singular subject is "imposes" (however, using the third person present tense form of the verb is unnecessary here because we often use the noun form of the verb after possessives such as "government's"). Instead, it would be more common to say "The government imposed a fine." Nonetheless, the original sentence does not contain any grammatical errors. - There is no missing punctuation or capitalization error in the sentence. Therefore, I will assign a score of 1 for this grammatically correct sentence.
1	The sentence "Did Athena help us?" is grammatically correct. It consists of a question tag ("did") followed by the subject ("Athena"), the auxiliary verb "help," and the object "us." All words are spelled correctly, and there are no punctuation or agreement errors. Therefore, I would classify this sentence as being grammatically accurate.
1	The sentence "You wanted to meet the man I saw" is grammatically correct. There are no spelling errors or punctuation mistakes. Additionally, the word order follows standard English syntax rules. Therefore, it receives a score of 1 for being a valid English sentence.
0	The verb "demonize" means to portray someone or something as evil. It takes a direct object but does not require any preposition before the direct object. Therefore, the sentence "Anson demonized David every day" would be grammatically correct if it were written as "Anson demonized David every day." However, since there is no comma between "David" and "every," they are being interpreted together as one unit (a noun phrase) serving as the direct object of the verb "demonized." This creates ambiguity about who or what was being demonized daily - just David, or both Anson and David? To avoid confusion, we can insert a pronoun ("him") after "David" so that it becomes clearer whom the action refers to. Hence, the corrected version could read either "Anson demonized him every day" or "Anson demonized David each day."
0	The word "programme" should be spelled as "program." Additionally, there should be no question mark since the statement is expressing a fact rather than asking a question. A corrected version would read: "There is a program about Euripides on Radio 4 tonight."
1	The sentence "Medea denied poisoning the phoenix" is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple sentence structure where the subject ("Medea") is followed by the verb ("denied") and the object ("poisoning the phoenix"). Additionally, all words are spelled correctly, and there are no punctuation errors or awkward phrasing that could make it difficult to understand. Therefore, I would rate this sentence as being completely correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("the elixir"), a verb ("was hidden"), and a prepositional phrase ("in a hole in the ground") that modifies the verb by telling us where the elixir was hidden. The word order is also correct, following standard English syntax rules. Therefore, I would rate this sentence as grammatically correct.
0	The sentence "Extremely frantically, Anson danced at Trade" is grammatically incorrect because "Trade" cannot be used as a noun without any article or determiner preceding it. A corrected version of this sentence could be "Extremely frantately, Anson danced at the trade show."
0	This sentence contains multiple grammatical errors. The first error occurs in the verb form "did you ask." In present tense, it would be "do you ask," but since there's a past time reference ("who Medea gave"), we need to use the past tense of the auxiliary verb "do" which is "did". So, it should be "Did you ask...". The next error is that there's no clear subject for the question. It seems like the intended subject is missing after "you asked", making the sentence incomplete and confusing. Lastly, "who Medea gave" lacks context and clarity regarding what or whom Medea gave. Therefore, the corrected version could be something like "What did you ask about what Medea had given?" if that fits the intended meaning.
1	The sentence "It's Anson that I like" is grammatically correct. In this sentence, "it" is a dummy subject used to introduce the real subject of the sentence, which is "Anson." The verb "is" agrees with the singular subject "it," and the pronoun "I" refers to the speaker. Therefore, there are no grammatical errors in this sentence.
0	The verb "try" should be followed by an infinitive form of a verb (e.g., "to poison"), but instead it's incorrectly followed by the noun "nurse." A corrected version would be "Medea tried to poison her children through the nurse," or "Medea asked the nurse to poison her children."
0	The verb tense in this sentence is incorrect. The past tense of "to feel" (i.e., "I felt") does not agree with the present tense of "to know" (i.e., "I know"). To make the sentence grammatically correct, either both verbs need to be in the past tense ("I felt that I knew you"), or both verbs need to be in the present tense ("I feel that I know you").
0	The subject-auxiliary verb inversion required for a question has been applied incorrectly. It should be "Will he **do** it?" instead of "will he **can** do it?" because the auxiliary verb "will" already indicates future tense; therefore, there's no need to use another auxiliary verb "can".
0	The sentence "I ate that she was happy" is grammatically incorrect because it uses the wrong word to connect two clauses. Instead of "that," a conjunction such as "because" or "while" would be appropriate here. For example, one could say "I ate while she was happy." Alternatively, if the intended meaning is something like "I knew that she was happy," then "ate" must be replaced by a verb that makes sense in that context (e.g., "realized").
1	The sentence "Anson believed himself to be handsome" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Anson," which is the person who is doing the action of believing. The verb in the sentence is "believed," which is in the past tense and agrees with the singular subject "Anson." The reflexive pronoun "himself" refers back to the subject of the sentence and indicates that Anson is directing his belief towards himself. Finally, the adjective "handsome" describes Anson's appearance. Therefore, the sentence is a complete thought and all the words are used correctly, making it a grammatical sentence.
1	The sentence "We arrived about six o'clock" is grammatically correct. The word "about" functions as an adverb here, indicating that the arrival time was approximately six o'clock. This structure is commonly used to express an approximate time of occurrence for events in English.
0	The verb tense in this sentence is incorrect. "Gilgamesh is fighting the dragon" or "Gilgamesh fought the dragon" would both be grammatically correct, but mixing past and present tense as in "is having fought" creates a confusing and ungrammatical sentence.
0	The reflexive pronoun "himself" is incorrect in this context because it is being used as a subject complement after the linking verb "was." In this case, the correct form of the reflexive pronoun would be "he," so the correct sentence is "Anson thought that he was happy."
1	The sentence "Fortunately Hermione passed biology" is grammatically correct. It consists of a subordinating conjunction ("fortunately") that introduces a clause modifying the main verb phrase ("Hermione passed biology"). Both clauses contain appropriate subjects and verbs, so no corrections need to be made.
0	The sentence contains a double negative ("might not" and "but"), which can lead to confusion about the intended meaning. A better way to phrase it would be "I might not go to the party; instead, I'll wash my hair." Alternatively, if the intention was to express that the speaker will definitely stay home to wash their hair, one could say "I am certainly not going to the party; instead, I am washing my hair."
0	The verb "thought" requires an object form of the pronoun after it, but instead we see a reflexive pronoun "myself." We would use "me" as the object here, so the corrected version of the sentence is "I thought he liked me."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It consists of a subject ("the butler"), an auxiliary verb ("sent"), a direct object ("the poison"), and an indirect object ("to Dinah"). There are no spelling errors or misplaced words, so it can be considered a well-formed English sentence.
0	This sentence contains redundant phrasing which makes it unnecessarily verbose. The phrase "to appear to seem" can be simplified to simply "appears." Thus, a more concise way of expressing this idea would be: "Jason appears to be sick."
0	This sentence is grammatically incorrect because it uses the wrong verb form for asking a question. The proper way to phrase this question would be "Who did you ask?" instead of "What did you ask who saw?" In English, when we want to know which person performed an action (in this case, asking), we use the subject-auxiliary inversion structure ("who did" instead of "did who"). Additionally, including "what" at the beginning doesn't make sense here as there's no clear antecedent or context provided for understanding what object might be referred to by "what."
1	The sentence "We linguists love to argue" is grammatically correct. It consists of a subject ("we"), a helping verb ("do"), the main verb in its present participle form ("arguing"), and the object ("to argue"). Additionally, it follows standard English syntax rules for word order (subject-verb-object). All words are spelled correctly and used appropriately within their context. Therefore, I would rate this sentence as grammatically correct.
0	The sentence "He can will go" is grammatically incorrect because it contains two auxiliary verbs ("can" and "will") that serve similar functions. In a simple tense sentence, we typically only need one auxiliary verb to express the intended meaning. Here, the sentence could be corrected as either "He can go" or "He will go," depending on whether the emphasis is on his ability or future intention, respectively.
0	The sentence "How fierce the battle?" is grammatically incorrect because it lacks a proper question word (such as "how" or "what") to begin the interrogative sentence. A corrected version could be "How fierce was the battle?" or "What was the ferocity of the battle?"
0	The sentence contains a grammatical error known as a fused relative construction. It would be better to divide it into two separate questions for clarity and proper syntax. A corrected version could read: "Which king did you have in mind? And which city do you think he invaded?" Additionally, there seems to be no clear context or reference point for either the identity of the king being asked about or the city that was supposedly invaded, making the original question somewhat confusing even if we ignore the syntactic issue.
0	The phrase "some disgruntled old pigs" contains a subject-verb agreement error. Since "disgruntled old pigs" is plural, the verb should be "are," not "is." Additionally, using "those" before "ditches" implies that the speaker has previously mentioned or identified specific ditches, but no such mention exists. A corrected version of the sentence could read: "There are some disgruntled old pigs in the ditches that humans love to eat." However, even if grammatically fixed, it remains unclear what exactly makes these pigs "disgruntled," and cannibalistic language may not be appropriate depending on context.
0	The verb "eating" cannot be used with the subject "that banana." In active voice, a grammatically correct sentence would have to read something like "The monkey is eating that banana." This error can also be described as violating the principle of animacy; only animate subjects (those capable of action) can perform actions on objects through transitive verbs such as "eat," whereas inanimate objects (such as "that banana") do not possess agency and thus cannot eat or otherwise act upon another object.
0	The sentence "Burn them!" is missing context to be grammatically correct. Who or what is being referred to when saying "them"? A complete sentence requires a subject and predicate, and this one is lacking a clear subject for the verb "burn."
1	The sentence "It stinks that Aphrodite is omnipotent" is grammatically correct. Here's why: - The subject of the sentence is "it," which refers to a situation or state of affairs expressed by the clause "that Aphrodite is omnipotent." - The verb "stinks" indicates a negative evaluation on the part of the speaker towards the situation referred to by "it." This usage of "stink" as a linking verb followed by a noun phrase ("that Aphrodite is omnipotent") is informal but acceptable in spoken and written English. - The subordinating conjunction "that" introduces a content clause expressing the fact that Aphrodite has the property of being omnipotent (i.e., having unlimited power). - The proper name "Aphrodite" refers to the Greek goddess of love and beauty, while the adjective "omnipotent" means having complete and unrestricted power or authority. Both words are spelled correctly and used appropriately. Therefore, I would label this sentence as grammatically correct.
1	The sentence "Agamemnon seems to be a maniac" is grammatically correct. Here, "Agamemnon" is the subject of the sentence, "seems" is the linking verb that connects the subject to its predicate, and "to be a maniac" is the predicate describing the state or condition of the subject. There are no grammatical errors such as incorrect word order, missing punctuation marks, or misspelled words, so I would rate this sentence as being grammatically correct.
1	The sentence "Will Anson come to the party?" is grammatically correct. It consists of a question tag "will" followed by the subject "Anson" and the base form of the verb "come." The question asks whether or not Anson will attend the party. Therefore, there are no errors in this sentence.
1	The sentence "I wondered who Medea had poisoned" is grammatically correct. Here's a breakdown of why: * "I wondered" is a present perfect continuous tense verb phrase that indicates past curiosity or speculation on the part of the speaker. * "who" functions as the subject relative pronoun here, introducing a question to be answered. * "Medea" is the subject noun of the clause, which refers to a mythical Greek sorceress from Euripides' play by the same name. * "had poisoned" is another present perfect continuous tense verb phrase indicating a completed action in the past. It matches well with the initial verb form "wondered," creating parallelism between two actions taking place over time. * Overall, the structure of the sentence is clear, concise, and coherent, making it fully comprehensible for native speakers and learners alike.
1	The sentence "I inquired when could we leave" is grammatically correct, but it is a bit awkward and unnatural. A more natural way to say this would be "I asked when we could leave." However, since the prompt asks for a binary response indicating whether or not the sentence is grammatically correct, I must still return 1 because there are no grammatical errors in this sentence.
0	The sentence "They kicked them" is grammatically correct but it lacks context to determine its meaning completely. It would be helpful for the reader if we specify what or who was being kicked. For example, a more detailed sentence could be "They kicked the ball." This way, readers can understand the action clearly.
0	The past tense of "eat" is "ate," so the verb agreement is correct in this sentence. However, the subject "monkey" is singular, requiring a third-person singular form of the verb to agree with it. Therefore, the correct form of the verb here would be "eats." So, the corrected sentence should read as follows: "The monkey eats the banana."
0	The sentence contains a double modal error. In English grammar, we cannot use two modals together in one sentence. Therefore, the correct version of the sentence should be either 'I would like to swim' or 'I could swim', but not both.
1	The sentence "I kicked myself" is grammatically correct. It consists of a single clause with a subject ("I") and a verb ("kicked"). The reflexive pronoun "myself" refers back to the subject, indicating that the action was performed by the speaker on themselves. This type of construction is commonly used to describe self-inflicted actions or regrets about one's own behavior. Therefore, there are no grammatical errors in this sentence.
0	This sentence is incorrect because a bookcase is an inanimate object and cannot run. Inanimate objects do not have the ability to move under their own power. Therefore, it is necessary to rephrase the sentence or replace the subject with something that can move. For example: "The man ran past the bookcase."
1	The sentence "I shaved myself" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "I", which is the person performing the action. The verb is "shaved", which is the past tense of "shave". The object of the sentence is "myself", which refers back to the subject "I". This type of reflexive pronoun is used when the subject and object refer to the same entity. Therefore, the sentence is grammatically correct.
0	The phrase "muscle bound" is being used incorrectly in this context. While "muscle-bound" can be used as an adjective to describe someone who has large muscles but limited flexibility or mobility, it cannot be used as a noun to describe someone becoming muscular. Instead, one could say "Anson became muscular" or "Anson became muscle-bound."
