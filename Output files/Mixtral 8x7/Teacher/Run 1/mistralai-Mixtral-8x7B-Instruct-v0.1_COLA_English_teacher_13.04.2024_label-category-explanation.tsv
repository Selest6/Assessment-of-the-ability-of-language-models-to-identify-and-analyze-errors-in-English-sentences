label	category	explanation
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct because it follows standard English syntax rules for word order and structure. The subject ("the sailors") comes before the verb ("rode"), and the object ("the breeze") comes between the verb and its prepositional phrase modifier ("clear of the rocks"). Additionally, each clause has a finite verb, making the meaning of the sentence clear.
1	Syntax	The sentence "The weights made the rope stretch over the pulley" is grammatically correct. In terms of syntax, it follows the standard structure of a sentence, consisting of a subject ("weights"), a verb ("made"), and an object ("the rope"). Additionally, there is a prepositional phrase ("over the pulley") modifying the action described by the verb. Overall, the sentence demonstrates proper word order and grammatical construction.
1	Syntax	The sentence "The mechanical doll wriggled itself loose" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "The mechanical doll" is a noun phrase serving as the subject of the sentence. It contains the determiner "the," followed by the adjective "mechanical" modifying the noun "doll." * "wriggled" is the verb of the sentence, indicating past tense action performed by the subject. * "itself" is a reflexive pronoun referring back to the subject, showing it was the doer of its own action. * "loose" serves as an adverb describing how or where the action took place. Overall, there are no syntax errors in this sentence, making it grammatically sound.
1	Semantics	The sentence "If you had eaten more, you would want less" is grammatically correct and makes sense semantically. It expresses a hypothetical situation where if the listener had consumed more food in the past (had eaten more), they would desire less now because their hunger has been satisfied. Therefore, the answer is 1, indicating that the sentence is correct, and the category is semantics as it relates to meaning rather than grammar or word structure.
0	Semantics	The sentence "As you eat the most, you want the least" is semantically incorrect because it creates a logical contradiction. Typically, people who consume more tend to require or desire more as well, rather than wanting less. Therefore, the relationship between eating a lot and wanting the least is illogical and confusing, making the sentence difficult to understand.
0	Semantics	This sentence is semantically incorrect because it conveys a meaning that is illogical or contradictory. In this case, the idea being expressed is that wanting something more strongly will lead to eating less, but this causal relationship between desire and consumption is not necessarily true. Additionally, the phrase "the more you would want" implies an increase in desire, while "you would eat less" suggests a decrease in consumption, making the overall statement inconsistent.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a syntactic error known as a split subject-verb construction. This occurs when there is an intervening phrase or clause between the subject and its verb, causing confusion about the intended meaning. In this case, the intended meaning seems to be that the more John eats, the more money he has to pay; however, due to the syntax, it appears as though John himself is being consumed in some way. To fix the issue, we can rephrase the sentence so that the subject ("the more John eats") remains close to its corresponding verb ("pays"): Corrected Sentence: The more John eats, the more he has to pay.
0	Syntax	The issue with this sentence lies in its syntax, specifically with regard to subject-verb agreement. In the second clause, "she gets" should be changed to "she gets depressed." This is because when we combine two independent clauses using a conjunction (in this case, "and"), both verbs must agree with their respective subjects in number. Here, "Mary" is singular, so the verb "listens" is correctly in the third person singular form; however, "gets" needs to change to match "she," making it "she gets depressed." Thus, the corrected version would read as follows: "Mary listens to the Grateful Dead, and she gets depressed."
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct. The clause "the angrier Mary got" is a comparative phrase modifying the subject of the second clause "she." Both clauses express a causal relationship indicating that as Mary's anger increased, so did her frequency of looking at pictures. No grammatical or syntactical errors can be found in this sentence.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct. It follows standard subject-verb-object word order, uses appropriate verb tense (present simple), and has no missing or extra words. Additionally, the relationship between the two clauses is clear - as the level of importance increases, the person's expectations decrease. Therefore, there are no syntax errors in this sentence.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct. It follows standard English syntax rules for subject-verb agreement, word order, and tense consistency. Additionally, it contains no spelling or punctuation errors.
1	Syntax	The sentence "John was lots more obnoxious than Fred" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "John" is a proper noun used as the subject of the sentence. It agrees with the verb "was." * "Was" is the auxiliary verb used to form the passive voice or to indicate past tense. In this case, it indicates past tense. * "Lots more obnoxious" functions as a comparative phrase modifying the adjective "obnoxious," indicating that John was a greater degree of obnoxious compared to someone else (in this case, Fred). * "Than" introduces the second part of the comparison, introducing the standard of measurement for the comparison made by the first clause. * "Fred" is another proper noun functioning as the object of the preposition "than." Overall, there are no grammatical errors present in this sentence, so I have labeled it as correct (label = 1) and categorized it under syntax since we are discussing the structure and arrangement of words within the sentence (category = Syntax).
1	Semantics	This sentence is grammatically correct and semantically meaningful. It conveys a clear message about cause and effect - when more people are given beer, more people become ill as a result. Therefore, there are no errors in syntax, morphology or other areas to be found here.
1	Semantics	This sentence is semantically correct because it conveys a clear meaning and expresses a cause-and-effect relationship between two actions (Bill smoking and Susan hating him). The use of the comparative form "more" indicates a gradual increase in both actions as they relate to each other.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the rules for syntax (word order) in English. It contains a clear subject ("the more pictures of him that appear in the news"), verb ("become"), and object ("John"). Additionally, each clause is appropriately linked together using subordinating conjunctions such as "the more" and "the more embarrassed." Overall, there are no grammatical errors or awkward phrasings in this sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Every senator seems to become more corrupt, as he talks to more lobbyists." is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "Every senator" serves as the subject of the sentence. It is a determiner phrase (DP) headed by the quantificational determiner "every", modified by the singular noun "senators". This DP refers to all individual senators, implying universal quantification over the set of all possible senators. * The main verb is "seems", which takes the infinitival clause "to become more corrupt" as its complement. * The adjective "more" modifies the comparative form of the adjective "corrupt", indicating a degree-based comparison between the current state of corruption for each senator and some other point of reference. * The subordinating conjunction "as" introduces the second clause, which functions as a temporal adjunct. * Within the second clause, we have the pronoun "he", referring back to "every senator". This use of a singular pronoun is appropriate because the antecedent is singular. However, if there was ambiguity regarding the intended referent, it might be better to replace "he" with something like "each" or "a". * The present participle "talking" heads another gerund phrase functioning as the object of the preposition "to". Together, they modify the plural noun "lobbyists". Overall, syntactically speaking, everything checks out!
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a misplaced relative clause "because he likes." This type of clause needs to be immediately after the noun it modifies, so it should either modify "John" or "Sally", but not sit at the end of the sentence as it currently does. A possible correction would be: "Who does John visit because he likes her?" (modifying 'Sally') or "Who is it that John visits Sally because he likes?" (creating a new noun phrase for the relative clause to modify).
1	Syntax	The sentence "Marianne did not leave" is grammatically correct. In negative statements in English, we use auxiliary verb (in this case, "did") before the main verb ("leave"). Additionally, subject-auxiliary inversion occurs as well, where the auxiliary verb comes before the subject ("Marianne"), making the sentence syntactically correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "He could not have been working" is grammatically correct. It follows standard English syntax rules for verb tense agreement and word order. Here's a breakdown of the structure of the sentence: * Subject: he * Auxiliary Verb (Modal): could * Negative Particle: not * Perfect Tense Helping Verb: have * Past Participial Verb Form: been working All these elements combine to form a complex verb phrase expressing past ability negated by "not," followed by a present perfect participle clause indicating an action completed or ongoing before some point in the past.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a double negative (he can not), which creates confusion and makes it syntactically incorrect. Changing "can not" to "cannot" or simply "couldn't" would make the sentence grammatically correct while preserving its intended meaning.
1	Syntax	The sentence "You will believe Bob." is grammatically correct because it follows standard English syntax rules. It contains a subject ("you"), an auxiliary verb ("will"), and an object ("Bob"). Additionally, the tense is consistent throughout the sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence "John has not kissed Mary" is grammatically correct. It follows the standard subject-verb-object (SVO) word order in English. The subject "John" comes first, followed by the auxiliary verb "has," the negation "not," and the past participle "kissed." The object of the sentence, "Mary," appears after the verb phrase "has not kissed." Additionally, the morphological forms of all words are appropriate for their intended meanings. Therefore, there are no syntax, semantic, or morphological errors in this sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence "I said that never in my life had I seen a place like Bangor" is grammatically correct. It follows the rules for subject-verb agreement, word order, and tense consistency. Additionally, it utilizes complex syntax through the use of subordinating conjunctions ("that") and relative clauses ("like Bangor").
0	Syntax	In English, we typically use object pronouns (me, you, him, her, it, us, them) after verbs instead of subject pronouns (I, you, he, she, it, we, they). The verb "look up" requires a direct object, but "it" is being used as a subject here. Changing "it" to "him" or "her," depending on what Mickey was looking up, would make the sentence grammatically correct. Alternatively, changing "up" to "at" would allow for the use of the subject form "it." For example, all of these revisions would be grammatical: * Mickey looked up at it. * Mickey looked him up. * Mickey looked her up.
1	Syntax	The sentence "There tended to be a lot of discussion" is grammatically correct. In this sentence, "there" serves as an expletive subject, while "tended" functions as the linking verb connecting the subject to its predicate nominal phrase, "a lot of discussion." This structure is syntactically sound, following standard rules for forming complete sentences in English.
1	Other Category	The sentence "John tried to be a good boy" is grammatically correct. Therefore, it returns 1. It does not contain any errors related to syntax (the arrangement of words to create meaningful phrases), semantics (meaningful relationships between words or phrases), or morphology (formation of words using affixes). Hence, I will categorize it as 'Other'. This category includes aspects such as spelling, punctuation, idiomatic expressions, etc., but there's no issue here either; therefore, overall, this sentence seems perfectly fine.
1	Other Category	The sentence "John is eager." is grammatically correct. The subject "John" is a proper noun and the verb "is" agrees with it in number. Additionally, the word "eager" correctly modifies the subject by describing his state of mind or readiness. Therefore, there are no syntax, morphological, or semantic errors in this sentence.
1	Other Category	The sentence "We want John to win." is grammatically correct. Here's a brief explanation for each area of language: Syntax: The syntax (word order) of the sentence is correct. In English, we typically use subject-verb-object word order, and this sentence follows that pattern ("we" as the subject, "want" as the verb, and "John to win" as the object). Semantics: The meaning of the sentence is clear and unambiguous. It conveys the idea that the speaker wants John to be victorious or successful in some way. Morphology: The morphological structure of the words in the sentence is correct. Each word is inflected appropriately according to its grammatical function in the sentence. For example, "we" is the plural form of the first person pronoun, indicating multiple speakers; "want" is the base form of the verb, agreeing with the plural subject; and "John" is a proper noun that functions as the direct object of the sentence. Overall, there are no errors in the formation of individual words or their combination into larger units.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct because it follows standard English syntax rules for word order (subject-verb-object) and contains proper punctuation. Additionally, each word is used appropriately within its context.
0	Syntax	In standard English, we would say "The gas escaped from the tube," rather than "The tube was escaped by gas." This is because the verb "to escape" typically requires a preposition (in this case, "from") after it when referring to the source or origin of the escaping entity. Additionally, passive voice constructions such as "was escaped" generally require a clear subject, but here the subject ("gas") appears in a prepositional phrase instead of being placed before the verb.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Water bubbled up out of the kettle" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of syntax for English sentences. Specifically, it has a subject ("water"), a verb ("bubbled") and an object or prepositional phrase ("up out of the kettle"). Additionally, the word order is appropriate and there are no grammatical errors such as subject-verb agreement or incorrect use of tense.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct because it follows standard subject-verb-object word order (SVO) in English ("the tub" as the subject, "leaked" as the verb, and "water" as the object). Additionally, each word is used appropriately within its context and there are no grammatical errors such as incorrect tense or agreement between subject and verb.
1	Syntax	The sentence "What the water did to the bottle was fill it." is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "What" serves as a relative pronoun introducing a clause that modifies "the thing that the water did to the bottle," which refers back to "it" later on in the sentence. This construction is called a cleft sentence, where the emphasis is placed on the action (filling) rather than on the water or the bottle itself. * "The water" is the subject of the verb "did", indicating agency (who performed the action). * "To the bottle" is a prepositional phrase specifying the indirect object of the transitive verb "fill". It indicates who received the effect of the action. * "Was fill it" represents a passive voice construction, consisting of the linking verb "was" followed by the past participle form "filled" (which can be contracted into "fill"), referring back to "the thing that the water did to the bottle." Since we use a passive voice here, the focus is more on what happened (bottle being filled), instead of who did it (water). Overall, while unusual word order-wise, the sentence follows proper grammatical rules for syntax.
1	Syntax	The sentence "What the water did to the whole bottle was fill it." is grammatically correct. It follows the proper subject-verb agreement, has a clear grammatical structure, and all the words used are appropriate for their intended meaning. Additionally, there are no spelling errors or punctuation issues. Therefore, I would rate this sentence as being syntactically correct.
0	Syntax	In English, we don't use "the" before a mass noun such as "fluid" when it refers to something unspecific or general. Therefore, the correct sentence would be: "The tank leaked fluid freely." Alternatively, if you want to emphasize that a particular type of fluid was involved, you could say "The tank leaked the specific fluid freely," but without additional context indicating a specific kind of fluid, just saying "fluid" implies non-specificity.
1	Syntax	The sentence "John lay the ball in the box" is grammatically correct. In this sentence, "lay" is used as a transitive verb taking the direct object "the ball". The subject "John" performs the action on the object. Therefore, there is no mistake in syntax or any other aspect in this sentence.
1	Other Category	The sentence "John owns the book." is grammatically correct. Therefore, I am returning a 1 for this example. No specific category needs to be addressed because there are no errors in syntax, semantics, or morphology in this sentence.
1	Syntax	The coordination of two gerund-participial clauses ("persuading Mary to leave" and "Sue to stay") by a single instance of the conjunction "and" is licit because both coordinate structures share the same subject (understood as "we"). This construction thus follows standard rules for syntactic coordination without any errors or violations.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct. It uses appropriate verb tenses (consider, found) and word forms (probably, actually), as well as proper punctuation. Additionally, the sentence structure is clear and logical, making it easy for the reader to understand the intended meaning.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Mary beautifully plays the violin" is grammatically correct. In terms of syntax, it follows a standard subject-verb-object (SVO) structure where "Mary" is the subject, "plays" is the verb, and "the violin" is the object. Additionally, the adverb "beautifully" correctly modifies the verb "plays," describing how the action is being performed.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a misplaced modifier error. The phrase "probably will immediately" is modifying "John," but it's intended to modify "learn." A corrected version would be: "Clearly, John will probably immediately learn French perfectly." Alternatively, for emphasis on "probably": "Clearly, John will learn French probably immediately perfectly."
0	Syntax	The sentence "Sue gave to Bill a book" contains extra words that make it unnecessarily wordy. In modern English, we typically use the double object construction for verbs like give, where the indirect object (the recipient) comes before the direct object (the thing being given). So a more natural way to phrase the sentence would be "Sue gave Bill a book." This shorter version conveys the same meaning without adding unnecessary prepositions.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct. In this sentence, "the men" serves as the subject and "will all leave" serves as the predicate. The use of the auxiliary verb "will" indicates future tense, while "all" functions as a determiner modifying the noun "men", indicating that every man will leave. Additionally, the word order follows standard English syntax rules, making it a well-constructed sentence.
1	Other Category	The sentence "John went home." is grammatically correct. It consists of a proper noun subject ("John"), followed by a verb phrase ("went home"). The sentence expresses a complete thought (a simple sentence) and exhibits no errors in syntax, semantics or morphology; therefore, it falls under the category 'Other'.
0	Syntax	The phrase "seriously to the dean" is incorrect. It should be "seriously before the verb 'represented'" or "to the dean seriously". Additionally, it would sound more natural to say "as a genuine linguistic expert" instead of just "as a genuine linguist." So the corrected sentence could read either "They represented seriously to the dean as a genuine linguistic expert," or "They seriously represented to the dean as a genuine linguist."
0	Syntax	In standard English, subject pronouns (I, you, he, she, it, we, they) typically come before verbs. The verb “love” requires a subject, but no appropriate subject is provided before the verb. A correct version could be “They love us.”
1	Other Category	The sentence "It is nice to go abroad" is grammatically correct. Therefore, I am returning a score of 1. Since there are no syntactic, semantic, or morphological errors, the category for this question would be something other than those three options.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Mary intended John to go abroad" is grammatically correct. In terms of syntax, it follows a proper structure where the subject (Mary) performs an action (intended) on an object (John), followed by an infinitive phrase ("to go abroad") expressing the purpose or result of the action.
1	Syntax	The sentence "I remembered having kissed Mary" is grammatically correct. It follows the rules for syntax, or word order, in English. Specifically, it uses the past perfect tense ("had kissed") correctly to indicate a past action completed before another past action was started (in this case, remembering).
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct. It uses correlative conjunction "either" correctly linking two negative ideas - "I can't believe" and "Fred won't."
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a syntactic error known as a pronoun agreement error. Specifically, the subject ("I") does not agree with its corresponding verb form ("also want"). In standard English, when using "I" as the subject, we typically use "do" or "does" before the main verb (in this case, "want") to indicate agreement between the subject and verb. Therefore, the corrected version would be: "John wants to read Fred's story, and I do too."
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a syntactic error related to subject-verb agreement. In the second clause ("but we couldn't decide who to"), 'to' is unnecessary since it follows the infinitive verb 'decide'. However, if we remove 'to', there will still be a missing complement for the preposition 'who'. A more appropriate way to phrase the sentence would be "We wanted to invite someone, but we couldn't decide whom." Alternatively, keeping 'to' and changing 'who' to 'that' can make the sentence grammatically correct as well - "We wanted to invite someone, but we couldn't decide who to invite."
1	Syntax	The sentence "Mary will read Fred's story, and Joe will read Holly's." is grammatically correct. It follows the standard Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) word order in English and uses appropriate verb forms ("will read") for future tense. Additionally, the use of possessive nouns ("Fred's" and "Holly's") correctly indicates ownership or association with the stories being read.
0	Syntax	The clause "Holly shouldn't" lacks a proper subject-verb agreement, as it requires a third person singular verb form ("she shouldn't") when referring to "Holly." Additionally, there must be a conjunction (such as "but," "or," or "while") between two clauses if they refer to different subjects, so the corrected sentence would read: "Mary claimed that she shouldn't eat cabbage, while Holly shouldn't either."
0	Syntax	The second coordinated clause "and I also came to be" is ungrammatical because it lacks a proper subject. It seems that the speaker intended to say "and I also did," but as written, the sentence contains a syntactic error. This type of mistake falls under the category of syntax since it involves the arrangement of words within a sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence "If I can, I will work on it." is grammatically correct. The syntax is correct because there is a subordinating conjunction ("if") introducing a dependent clause, followed by a main clause. Additionally, subject-verb agreement is maintained throughout the sentence, as well as proper word order within each clause.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct. It uses parallel structure to connect two independent clauses with the conjunction "and." Both clauses have a subject ("Joe's neuroses" and "Sally") and a verb ("bother" and "does"). This construction emphasizes the idea that both subjects have the same effect on the object (his patrons).
0	Semantics	The sentence is grammatically correct but semantically unclear. It is ambiguous whether "which book Lilly did it for him" refers to a book that both José and Lilly were supposed to read or if it means that Lilly took over another task related to the book for José. To avoid confusion, consider revising the sentence to clarify what action Lilly performed regarding the book. For example: "I know which book José didn’t read for class, and which book Lilly instead read on his behalf."
0	Semantics	The second sentence is grammatically incorrect because the pronoun 'it' does not have a clear antecedent. It is unclear what exactly "Fred won't do." In order for the sentence to be corrected, it needs to specify what action or item Fred refuses to do or take. For example, "This is the one which Fred won't review" would be grammatically correct if we assume that 'one' refers to another object being discussed earlier in context.
1	Syntax	The sentence appears to be grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("I"), a verb ("know"), and two independent clauses connected by a conjunction ("and"). Each clause has its own subject and verb, making it clear who did what. Additionally, each clause includes proper use of tense agreement between verbs and their subjects. Furthermore, punctuation is used correctly throughout the sentence.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a syntactic error known as a misplaced modifier. Specifically, the phrase "my report that you hadn't" is intended to modify "Bob read," but it has been placed next to "Mag read." To fix the issue, we need to move the phrase so that it correctly follows "Bob read": "I know which book Mag read, and which book Bob read my report on that you hadn't." Alternatively, if the intended meaning is that both Mag and Bob had read the report before you did, then the correction would be: "I know which books Mag and Bob read, and that you hadn't read my report yet."
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows the rules for subject-auxiliary verb inversion ("I would...he"), as required in certain types of conditional clauses. The word "than" is used correctly to introduce a comparison, and both noun phrases after "than" have parallel structure (fruit vs. cookies). Overall, there are no syntax errors or ambiguities in this sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Rusty talked about himself only after Mary did talk about him" is grammatically correct. It contains two clauses - "Rusty talked about himself" and "Mary did talk about him." Both clauses follow the standard subject-verb-object (SVO) word order in English, making them syntactically correct. Additionally, the use of the conjunction "only" before "after" correctly indicates the sequence of events, while the pronouns "himself" and "he" agree in number and gender with their respective antecedents "Rusty" and "Mary," further demonstrating the sentence's grammatical accuracy.
0	Syntax	The repetition of the word 'talked' is unnecessary and incorrect in standard English. A corrected version could be: "Fred talked about everything before Rusty did."
1	Other Category	The sentence "John often meets Mary." is grammatically correct. Therefore, I am returning a 1 for this example. Since there are no errors related to syntax, semantics, or morphology, I have labeled it as 'Other Category'.
0	Syntax	The subject ("the problem") and verb ("perceives") do not agree in number; it should be "problems perceive" or "the problem perceived." However, neither option makes sense in context. A better way to phrase the statement would be "It is easy to perceive the problem," but without being able to change the original structure of the sentence, I must mark it as incorrect due to faulty agreement between subject and verb.
1	Syntax	The sentence "A hundred men surrounded the fort" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * The subject "a hundred men" is a noun phrase consisting of the determiner "a," the numeral "hundred," and the plural noun "men." It agrees with the verb "surrounded" in number (plural). * The main verb "surrounded" is a past tense form indicating completed action. It takes the preposition "the" followed by the object "fort." * Overall, the syntax of the sentence follows standard English word order rules for declarative sentences (subject-verb-object), making it grammatical.
0	Syntax	In English, we generally use a passive voice when referring to group actions where the receiver of the action (in this case, "me") is more important or emphasized than the doer of the action. Therefore, it would be grammatically correct to say "I was elected" instead of "we elected me." The sentence "We elected me" could potentially be used for emphasis or stylistic reasons, but without additional context, it sounds unnatural and confusing.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a misplaced relative pronoun "that." A noun or pronoun must come before a relative clause, but here, "report" follows "that," making the sentence ungrammatical. To fix it, we could say, "Which report did he submit that indicated John was incompetent?"
1	Syntax	The sentence "Mary has always preferred lemons to limes." is grammatically correct. It follows the standard structure for a comparative statement, where two things (lemons and limes) are compared using the preposition "to". Additionally, the verb tense ("has preferred") correctly indicates past preference.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a syntactic error because it lacks a main verb for the subject "he." Additionally, there is no preposition or object indicating where "the cats" were released. A possible correction could be: "He let the cats out when they were whining."
1	Other Category	The sentence "What did Bill buy?" is grammatically correct. It is a question asking about a past action performed by someone named Bill. The word "what" functions as the subject of the sentence and the auxiliary verb "did" indicates past tense. The main verb "buy" follows the auxiliary verb "did." Overall, there are no syntax, semantic or morphological errors present in this sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Mary saw the boy walking toward the railroad station." is grammatically correct. It follows standard subject-verb-object (SVO) word order and uses proper verb tense agreement between the auxiliary verb "was" and the present participle "walking". Additionally, it utilizes a prepositional phrase ("toward the railroad station") correctly.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a couple of syntax errors. Specifically, there is a missing verb after "was" and before "given," making it difficult for the reader to understand who or what gave the proof. Additionally, "that John had lied" does not have a clear referent in the previous clause; therefore, its function within the sentence remains unclear. Here's a possible correction: Corrected Sentence: A proof that the claim had been made was given when John admitted to lying.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a misplaced relative clause "which was caused by an overloaded transducer." A better way to construct the sentence would be: "He attributed the fire which destroyed most of my factory to a short circuit that was caused by an overloaded transducer." Alternatively, it could also be written as: "A short circuit, which was caused by an overloaded transducer, resulted in a fire that destroyed most of my factory."
0	Syntax	In this sentence, there is a misplaced modifier, which results in incorrect syntax. Specifically, the phrase "as being absurd" is modifying "the mayor," but it is intended to modify "the proposal." To fix the issue, we could say, "The mayor regarded the proposal to build a sidewalk from Dartmouth to Smith as absurd." This revised version makes clear that the proposal is what is being considered absurd, rather than the mayor.
1	Syntax	The sentence "I want that Bill left to remain a secret." is grammatically correct. Here, 'that' is used as a conjunction linking two clauses - "I want" (main clause) and "Bill left to remain a secret" (subordinate clause). The verb tenses ("want" vs. "left") match correctly, making it syntactically sound.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains multiple syntax errors. Specifically, there are two instances of the verb "drives" used incorrectly. It seems that the intended meaning is to say "I know a man whom Tom drives," but instead, it says "as drives." This creates confusion about the subject-verb agreement and the relationship between the clauses in the sentence.
0	Syntax	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in this sentence. The plural noun phrase "drowning cats" does not agree with the singular verb form "is." It should be "Drowning cats, which is against the law, are hard to rescue," or better yet, rephrase it as "Cats that are drowning, which is illegal, are difficult to rescue."
1	Syntax	The sentence "Muriel said nothing else than that she had been insulted" is grammatically correct. It uses a correlative conjunction ("not only...but also") implicitly, where "nothing else" serves as the first part and "than that she had been insulted" serves as the second part. This construction emphasizes that Muriel's statement was limited to acknowledging that she had been insulted, without adding anything further.
0	Syntax	The sentence "Himself is understood by Rutherford" contains a syntactic error because it violates the rule for reflexive pronouns. In English grammar, a reflexive pronoun (e.g., myself, yourself, himself) must refer back to a noun or pronoun within the same clause. Here, the subject of the sentence is "Himself," but there is no antecedent noun or pronoun to which it can refer. A possible correction could be "Rutherford understands himself."
1	Other Category	The sentence "I feel that Arch will show up" is grammatically correct, but it might be semantically incorrect depending on the context. Here's why: Syntax: The syntax (word order) of the sentence is correct. Semantics: The meaning of the sentence depends on the context. If the speaker has a feeling or intuition that Arch will appear later, then the sentence is semantically correct. However, if the speaker means that they can physically sense Arch's presence nearby, then the sentence may be semantically incorrect because feelings don't necessarily indicate physical proximity. Morphology: The morphological structure of each word is correct. Therefore, since the sentence is grammatically correct but could potentially have a different intended meaning based on context, we categorize it as belonging to the "Other Category".
0	Syntax	In this case, there is a subject-verb agreement error. The singular subject "the proof" requires a singular verb, but "is" is plural. It should be "The proof is difficult," or "Proving this set is difficult." Additionally, the phrase "this set" lacks an article (a/an), so it should be "the set". Thus, the corrected sentence would read either "The proof is difficult" or "Proving the set is difficult."
0	Syntax	This sentence contains a syntactic error known as a "comma splice." Comma splices occur when two independent clauses (clauses that can stand alone as complete sentences) are joined by only a comma. In this case, "The madrigals which Henry plays the lute" and "sound lousy" are both independent clauses, but they are incorrectly connected by a comma. To fix this error, we could either use a semicolon or period instead of the comma, or add a conjunction such as "and" after the comma. For example: "The madrigals which Henry plays the lute and sings sound lousy." or "The madrigals which Henry plays the lute sound lousy; he sings along anyway."
1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically correct as it follows the rules for word order and structure in English. Each clause has a subject ("Tom", "I", "Suzie") and a predicate (the action performed on each subject's object). Additionally, the coordinating conjunction "and" effectively joins the clauses together.
0	Syntax	The sentence provided is a question containing two separate interrogative phrases ("Where did" and "who ate"), but lacks proper coordination between them. A more appropriate way to phrase the sentence would be "Where did you go, and what did each person eat?" or some other variation that maintains grammatical coherence while conveying the intended meaning.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains multiple syntactic errors. Specifically, it is unclear who "which boy's" refers to, as there seems to be a missing or extra apostrophe. Additionally, the phrase "guardian's employer" is awkwardly constructed and may benefit from being rephrased for clarity. Finally, the verb tense is inconsistent throughout the sentence, making it difficult to understand the intended meaning. A possible corrected version could be "Whose boy did we elect as president of the company that employs their guardian?" However, without additional context, it is difficult to provide a definitive correction.
0	Semantics	The word "sane" can't be modified by a degree adverb such as "how." Instead, we would say "How sanE is Peter?" or "To what extent is Peter sane?"
1	Syntax	The sentence appears to be grammatically correct. It uses appropriate verb tense ("lives"), prepositions ("at," "where," "crosses"), articles ("the"), and conjunctions ("and"). Additionally, the subject-verb agreement is consistent throughout the sentence. Therefore, there are no syntax errors present.
0	Syntax	The pronoun 'it' in the second clause refers back to 'Route 150,' but the phrase 'at it' does not make sense in this context because we cannot say "my dad lives at Route 150." Instead, you can use a different preposition such as "on" or rephrase the sentence using possessive form. Here are some possible corrections: - My dad lives there too (assuming "there" refers to the location). - My dad lives on Route 150 as well. - My dad lives at the same place along the Hudson River.
0	Syntax	The phrase "to make up to" is incorrect in this context. It seems like there might be some confusion between the phrasal verb "make up to," meaning to curry favor with someone (which is informal and relatively uncommon), and the more common idiom "make up with," which means to reconcile after a disagreement or argument. However, even then, neither option fits grammatically into the sentence as it stands. A possible rewording could be "Who is she trying to reconcile with now?" or "Whom is she attempting to win over now?" depending on intended meaning.
0	Syntax	The verb tense used in the sentence is incorrect. Specifically, the past participle form "gotten" should be replaced with the simple past tense "gained." Additionally, there is no need for a preposition before the noun phrase "a plot," so it should simply read "Wind gained a plot..." However, even after making these corrections, the revised sentence would still lack clarity regarding who or what is doing the gaining. Therefore, I will assume that some context has been omitted from the original sentence. With those revisions, the corrected version might read as follows: Corrected Sentence: "Wind gained a plot to negotiate an honorable end to the war in Vietnam." (Note: This correction assumes additional context about who or what is attempting to gain access to the plot.)
1	Syntax	The sentence "Mike talked about politics yesterday to my friends" is grammatically correct. Here's a breakdown of its syntax: * "Mike" is the subject of the sentence. It is a proper noun referring to a person named Mike. * "talked" is the verb, indicating past tense action. * "about" is a preposition introducing the prepositional phrase "about politics." This phrase functions as an adverbial complement, providing more information about what Mike talked about. * "politics" is the object of the preposition "about," functioning here as the direct object of the verb "talked." * "yesterday" is an adverb modifying when the action took place. * "to" is another preposition introducing the prepositional phrase "to my friends." This phrase functions as an indirect object, specifying who Mike addressed his talk to. * "my friends" is the object of the preposition "to," functioning as the indirect object of the verb "talked." Overall, the sentence has a clear structure and all elements are syntactically connected and coherent.
1	Syntax	The sentence "It was expected by the reporters that the principal would fire some teacher" is grammatically correct. The subject-verb agreement is correct as "it" agrees with "was." Additionally, the passive voice used in this sentence is appropriate for formal writing and is grammatically sound. Therefore, there are no syntax errors in this sentence.
0	Syntax	The error in this sentence lies in subject-verb agreement and pronoun reference. The verb "quip" should agree with its plural subject "Mike and she." Also, it's unclear who "she" refers to since no other female has been introduced in the context. To fix these issues, a better version would be: "Which hats did Mike and she both say they never wore?"
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a mistake in subject-verb agreement. In the relative clause "did wear," the plural form of the verb "wear" is required because the subject "which girl(s)" is plural. However, the word "never" was mistakenly inserted between "did" and "wear." A corrected version would be: "Which girls did Mike quip never wore these hats?" or "Which girl did Mike quip never wore that hat?"
1	Syntax	The sentence “We donated wire for the convicts to build cages with” is grammatically correct. It has a clear subject (“we”), verb (“donated”), and object (“wire”) and follows the standard structure of an English sentence (Subject-Verb-Object). Additionally, the prepositional phrase “for the convicts to build cages with” provides additional information about the use of the wire. Overall, there are no syntactical errors in this sentence.
0	Syntax	The sentence "I won't have some money" contains a syntactic error because it uses the wrong form of the verb after "won't." In negative statements using contractions (e.g., "won't"), we use the base form of the verb instead of adding "-n't" or "-not" to the verb. Therefore, the correct way to express this idea would be "I won't have any money" or "I will not have some money," depending on the intended meaning.
1	Semantics	The sentence "Do you believe the claim that somebody was looking for something?" is grammatically correct. The word "believe" here functions as a verb taking a clause ("that somebody was looking for something") as its complement. This type of construction is used when expressing doubt or disbelief about the content of the clause. Therefore, there is no syntactic, morphological, or other error present in the sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows standard subject-verb-object word order and all elements agree in number (e.g., "he" corresponds to "tried"). Additionally, there are no missing or extra words, and punctuation is used correctly.
1	Syntax	The sentence "That Sam sometimes didn't sleep must have pleased somebody" is grammatically correct. It has a subject ("that"), a main verb ("must have pleased"), and a direct object ("somebody"). Additionally, it includes a subordinate clause ("Sam sometimes didn't sleep") that modifies the subject of the sentence. All of these elements combine to form a complex but well-constructed sentence with proper syntax.
0	Semantics	The pronoun "himself" is a reflexive pronoun, which refers back to the subject of the sentence. In this case, the subject is "I," so using "himself" as the object of the preposition "about" creates a semantic error because it does not correctly refer back to the subject. A corrected version would be "I talked to Winston about him."
0	Syntax	The first part of the sentence, "That the fuzz wanted him worried John," has several syntactic issues. It appears that there may be some missing words or a misplaced modifier. A possible correction could be "The fuzz wanted John to be worried" or "John, who the fuzz wanted worried, ..." However, even if we fix this issue, the overall structure of the sentence would still be awkward and difficult to understand due to its convoluted phrasing. Therefore, I will assume that the intended meaning is something like: "The fuzz wanted to worry John, but they didn't want to worry Mary." This revised version is grammatically correct and easier to comprehend.
0	Syntax	The coordinating conjunction "if" is used incorrectly in this sentence. It would be grammatically correct to say "If Sam works on it, I will work on it." or "I will work on it if Sam does." but combining them with "will be" creates a clumsy and ungrammatical structure.
0	Other Category	The sentence is grammatically correct. And here's how my response will be structured for a grammatically incorrect sentence: Label: 0 Category: (Syntax / Semantics / Morphology) Explanation: (Provide explanation for why the sentence is grammatically incorrect based on syntactic, semantic or morphological rules.) Please note that while I strive to provide accurate information, there may be cases where additional context is needed beyond just the sentence itself to fully understand any potential errors. Nonetheless, I'll do my best to give helpful explanations within the constraints provided. Let me know what sentences you have in mind!
0	Syntax	The preposition "with" should be followed by a noun or pronoun, but here it is followed by a clause "for you to cut up the onions." A correct version would be: "Here's a knife for you to cut up the onions with."
0	Semantics	The sentence contains a semantic error because of the incorrect use of the conjunction 'which' after a negative statement ('not everybody knows'). This type of construction implies that what follows will be true for some people but not others, whereas here it appears to mean something closer to 'and'. A possible correction would be 'Fluffy is sick, and not everyone knows about it.'
0	Semantics	The sentence "Maxwell is quite a doctor" is grammatically correct but semantically odd because the word "quite" implies some degree of uncertainty or reservation about Maxwell's qualifications as a doctor. A more appropriate way to express admiration for someone's skills as a medical professional would be to say "Maxwell is an excellent doctor" or "Maxwell is a very skilled physician." Therefore, I am returning 0 indicating that there is a problem with the sentence and assigning it to the category of Semantics since the issue lies in the meaning conveyed by the use of the word "quite."
0	Syntax	There is a superfluous comma after "tall" which creates a syntax error by introducing an unnecessary pause in the sentence. A corrected version would read: "The younger woman might have been tall and the older one definitely was blond."
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct. It contains two independent clauses ("Sally is tall, and may be blond" and "Sheila is short, and definitely is, blond") connected by a coordinating conjunction ("and"). Each clause has a subject ("Sally," "Sheila") and a predicate verb ("is tall," "may be blond," "is short," "definitely is"), making the sentence syntactically correct.
0	Syntax	The verb "try" should be followed by a base form of the verb, so it should be "I have to finish grading some papers." instead of "I have to try to finish grading some papers." In conditional sentences, we use "try to" + infinitive (e.g., "I will try to finish grading some papers"), but in this case, there's no need for a conditional structure as the action is certain.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a redundancy error in the phrase "for for." In English, we only need to use the preposition "for" once when expressing purpose or possession. Therefore, the corrected version would be: "The socks are ready for you to put on to be planned." However, even after removing the extra "for," there are still some issues with the wording and meaning of the sentence (semantic errors). I would suggest rewriting it as follows: "The socks are ready for you to put on; they're part of today's plan."
1	Syntax	The sentence “It is easy to play sonatas on this violin” is grammatically correct. In terms of syntax, it follows a logical structure where the subject (“it”) is followed by a linking verb (“is”) and a predicate adjective phrase (“easy to play sonatas on this violin”). This phrase describes the subject using an infinitive phrase (“to play sonatas on this violin”) as its complement. Overall, there are no errors in word order or arrangement in this sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence "This violin is difficult to play sonatas on." is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "This violin" is a noun phrase serving as the subject of the sentence. * "is" is a linking verb connecting the subject to its complement. * "difficult" is an adjective modifying the infinitival phrase "to play sonatas on," which serves as the predicate nominative (complement). * Both "play" and "sonatas" are verbs, while "on" is a preposition indicating where the action takes place. The sentence has a clear structure and conveys a coherent message. Therefore, it is syntactically correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a syntactic error where there is an extra "and" at the end of the sentence, making it incomplete and ungrammatical. Additionally, the object of "please," namely "my father," lacks its own verb or predicate, further contributing to the syntax error. A corrected version could be: "My mother is easy to please; she always likes what my father does."
1	Syntax	The sentence "Poor Bill, it had started to rain and he had no umbrella." is grammatically correct. It contains two independent clauses ("it had started to rain" and "he had no umbrella") connected by a coordinating conjunction ("and"). Each clause has a subject and a verb, making the syntax of the sentence correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a syntactic error where two independent clauses ("That the cops spoke to the janitor about it yesterday" and "that robbery") are connected without proper punctuation or conjunction. A coordinating conjunction such as 'and' or a semicolon would be needed for the sentence to be grammatically correct. Additionally, there seems to be missing information regarding what specifically is considered "terrible."
0	Syntax	The subject of the second clause, "he," is incorrectly connected to the first clause by a comma splice. It would be grammatically correct to say "Every student is a swinger, and he wears socks." However, it's still unclear who "he" refers to since only "every student" has been previously mentioned. A better way to phrase the original sentence could be "Every student wears socks and is a swinger."
1	Syntax	The sentence "That girl was given my binoculars by him." is grammatically correct. In terms of syntax, it follows the rules for word order and structure in English. The subject of the sentence is "that girl," the verb is "was given," and the objects are "my binoculars" and "him." The passive voice is used correctly, indicating that the action (giving) was performed by someone else (implied by "by him"). Therefore, there are no errors in this sentence related to syntax.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Bill didn't allege that Roger had eaten anything" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of English syntax. In particular, the subject ("Bill") comes before the verb ("didn't allege"), and the subordinate clause ("that Roger had eaten anything") correctly modifies the main clause. Additionally, the tense agreement between the auxiliary verb ("had eaten") and the main verb ("eaten") is consistent throughout the sentence. Therefore, there are no syntactic errors in this sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows standard subject-verb-object word order and uses proper verb tense agreement. Additionally, it employs a correlative conjunction ("not only...but also") correctly to connect two clauses. The meaning is clear, so there are no semantic issues. No morphological errors can be found either (e.g., irregular verbs or incorrect plural forms). Therefore, the syntax is correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Everybody around here who ever buys anything on credit talks in his sleep" is grammatically correct. It contains a relative clause ("who ever buys anything on credit") modifying the noun phrase "everybody around here." The pronoun "his" correctly refers back to the closest appropriate antecedent, "everybody," which is generally understood as referring to males and females. While some people might argue for gender-neutral language and suggest using "their" instead of "his," the use of "his" in this context is still considered grammatical according to traditional English usage.
0	Semantics	The sentence contains a semantic error. The phrase "the name of somebody" implies that there is only one person being referred to, but the use of "who had misgivings" suggests that more than one person may be intended. It would be better to say "I can't remember the names of people who had misgivings." This clarifies that multiple individuals may be included in the group.
1	Semantics	The sentence is grammatically correct but semantically odd because it implies that there's a specific expectation for writers or playwrights to meet in Vienna. Without additional context, the sentence doesn't make logical sense. However, since the prompt only asks for grammaticality judgment, I will mark it as correct.
0	Semantics	The sentence contains a semantic error because it lacks context or information necessary for understanding who or what is being referred to by "No writer, nor any playwright." It seems as though there may be some missing information about why we would care if no writers meet in Vienna. Additionally, without additional context, stating that "no writer" does something can sound strange because typically we talk about individual writers (e.g., "John Smith never meets in Vienna") rather than all writers collectively.
0	Semantics	The sentence contains a logical error known as a scope ambiguity. It's unclear whether it means that it's uncertain if there exists any student whom the speaker will marry or if the speaker intends to marry some particular students but it's uncertain if they all will agree. A clearer way to express this would be: "It's not certain that you will marry any student" (meaning it's doubtful there will be any marriage) vs. "The fact that you will marry any student is not certain" (meaning their agreement is questionable).
1	Syntax	The sentence "Felicia kicked the ball off the bench" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules for word order (subject-verb-object) and includes a preposition ("off") with its object ("the bench"). Additionally, the verb tense is consistent throughout the sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence “I sent the package halfway around the world” is grammatically correct because it follows the rules for English syntax (word order). In this case, the subject (“I”) comes first, followed by the verb (“sent”), and then the object (“the package”). Additionally, the adverb phrase “halfway around the world” modifies the verb and appears in a logical position within the sentence. Overall, there are no errors in grammar or word choice in this sentence.
0	Syntax	The phrase "out of" in this context implies motion away from a source or container (the basket), but there's no mention of how the ball was moved or where it ended up after being taken out of the basket. A more specific preposition such as "Sam grabbed the ball out **of** the basket and threw it into **the air**." would clarify its movement and location, making it grammatically correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Sam offered the ball out of the basket" is grammatically correct. In this sentence, "offered" is a verb in past tense, "the ball" is the direct object, and "out of the basket" is a prepositional phrase acting as an adverbial modifier telling us where the action took place or how it was done. Therefore, there is no syntax error in this sentence.
1	Other Category	The sentence "Park Square has a festive air." is grammatically correct. It consists of a noun phrase ("Park Square") followed by a verb phrase ("has a festive air"). Both phrases contain appropriate determiners (the definite article "the" before "Park," the possessive determiner "a" before "festive"), adjectives (the proper noun "Park" does not require an article or other determiner; the adjective "festive" modifies the noun "air"), and verbs ("has" agrees with its subject "Park Square" in number). Therefore, there are no syntax, semantic, or morphological errors in this sentence.
1	Other Category	This sentence is grammatically correct. It consists of a subject ("the worker") and a predicate ("will have a job"). The subject refers to a singular noun, so the verb "will have" agrees with it in number (singular). Additionally, the article "a" preceding "job" indicates that the noun is countable, making the sentence grammatical.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a mistake in subject-verb agreement. The subject "no one" is singular, but the verb "can forgive" is plural. It should be "No one can forgive that comment to you." instead of "No one can forgives that comment to you."
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows standard English syntax rules for word order and structure. Additionally, all words are used correctly and agree with each other morphologically (e.g., "rockets" would need to be used instead if referring to multiple rockets). Semantically, the meaning is clear and unambiguous. Therefore, no errors can be found in this sentence related to syntax, semantics, or morphology.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Sarah promised Catherine her old car, but then gave it to her son instead." is grammatically correct. It follows standard English syntax rules for subject-verb agreement, word order, and punctuation. Additionally, the use of pronouns, conjunctions, and commas are all used correctly. Therefore, there are no syntactic errors or other issues related to morphology, semantics, or any other category present in this sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence "I lent the book partway to Tony" is grammatically correct. In this sentence, the verb "lend" is correctly conjugated for the first-person singular subject "I." Additionally, the direct object "the book" follows the transitive verb "lent," indicating that something was indeed lent. Finally, the prepositional phrase "partway to Tony" provides additional information about how or where the action took place. Overall, the syntax of this sentence adheres to standard English grammar rules.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "the farmer," which is doing the action "loaded." The direct object of the verb is "the cart," which is receiving the action. Finally, we have a prepositional phrase "with apples" telling us what was used to load the cart. All these elements come together to form a coherent and grammatical sentence.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct because it follows standard English syntax rules for word order and structure. The subject of the sentence ("the farmer") is performing the action (dumping), so it comes before the verb. The object of the preposition ("with apples") refers to what the cart contains, following the verb phrase "dumped the cart." Overall, the sentence's grammatical construction makes its meaning clear and understandable.
0	Semantics	The sentence "Martha carved the baby a toy out of wood" contains a semantic error because it implies that Martha carved the baby, rather than carving a toy for the baby. This creates an unintended meaning that goes against what was likely intended by the speaker or writer. A corrected version could be "Martha carved a toy out of wood for the baby."
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct because it follows standard subject-verb-object (SVO) word order in English, where the subject ("the bread") comes before the verb ("cuts"), and the object ("easily") modifies the verb by telling us how or why something was cut. Additionally, the verb agrees with its singular subject in number.
0	Syntax	The verb "break" requires a direct object that describes what was broken. In this case, "Bill" cannot be the direct object because people generally can't be described as being "broken." Additionally, it seems unlikely that the intended meaning is for Janet to have physically injured Bill's finger. A more appropriate way to phrase the sentence could be "Janet broke Bill's finger," or if the intent is to say that Bill did something wrong, then "Janet caught Bill in the act (of doing something) on finger."
1	Syntax	The sentence "Janet broke the cup." is grammatically correct because it follows standard subject-verb-object (SVO) word order in English. Additionally, each word is correctly inflected for number and tense. Specifically, "Janet" is a singular third-person subject, "broke" is a past-tense verb that agrees with the subject, and "cup" is a singular object that follows the verb. Therefore, there are no syntax errors in this sentence.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct because it follows standard subject-verb-object (SVO) word order in English. Additionally, each word is correctly conjugated for its intended meaning and tense. The subject "visitor" is clearly identified as a singular noun, and the verb "rang" agrees with it by being in past tense form. The object "bell" completes the SVO structure without any ambiguity or confusion regarding syntax.
0	Syntax	The sentence "We pulled free" is grammatically incorrect because it lacks a direct object. In order for the verb "pull" to be used transitively (i.e., with a direct object), there needs to be something being pulled. For example, a correct sentence could be "We pulled the rope free." Without a direct object, the sentence is fragmented and does not convey a complete thought.
1	Syntax	The sentence "That movie always shocks people" is grammatically correct because it follows standard English syntax rules for word order and structure. The subject ("that movie") comes before the verb ("shocks"), and the object ("people") comes after the verb. Additionally, the use of the adverb "always" modifies how often the action occurs, providing more context about when or how frequently the shocking happens. Overall, there are no apparent morphological, syntactical, or semantic errors within this sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence "That movie always shocks" is grammatically correct. The subject "that movie" agrees with the verb "shocks." Additionally, there are no missing or extra words in the sentence. Therefore, it can be said that the syntax (sentence structure) is correct.
0	Syntax	In the sentence "Sharon came the room," there is a syntax error because the subject ("Sharon") and the location ("the room") have been switched around. The correct order for this type of sentence would be "Subject + Verb + Location." So, it should read as follows: "Sharon came into the room" or "Sharon entered the room."
1	Other Category	The sentence "Bill sent a package to Tom." is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple sentence structure (Subject-Verb-Object) and follows standard subject-verb agreement rules. Additionally, the prepositional phrase "to Tom" correctly modifies the verb "sent," providing clear information about who received the package. No errors can be found related to syntax, semantics, or morphology.
1	Syntax	The sentence "That acorn will grow into an oak tree." is grammatically correct. It follows standard subject-verb-object word order in English (SVO), where "that acorn" is the subject, "will grow" is the verb phrase, and "into an oak tree" is a prepositional phrase acting as an adverbial modifying how or where the growth occurs. Additionally, there are no spelling, punctuation, or morphological errors present in the sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence "He turned into a frog" is grammatically correct because it follows standard English syntax rules for subject-verb-object (SVO) word order. The subject ("he") comes first, followed by the verb ("turned"), and then the object ("a frog"). Additionally, the tense of the verb is consistent with the intended meaning of the sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence "I mixed the sugar into the butter." is grammatically correct. In terms of syntax (the arrangement of words to create meaningful sentences), it follows standard English structure: subject ("I"), verb ("mixed"), and object ("the sugar"). Additionally, the prepositional phrase "into the butter" modifies the verb by telling us where or how the action occurred.
0	Syntax	The sentence "Brian threw the fence with the stick" is syntactically incorrect because it implies that Brian used the fence as a tool or instrument to throw something with the help of the stick, which does not make logical sense. A more appropriate way to phrase this would be "Brian threw the stick at the fence."
1	Syntax	The sentence "Mira condemned Terry for the accident" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a simple sentence, consisting of a subject ("Mira"), a verb ("condemned"), and an object ("Terry"). Additionally, there is a prepositional phrase ("for the accident") that modifies the verb, making clear who or what was being condemned (i.e., Terry) and why (i.e., for causing the accident). Therefore, no corrections are needed in terms of syntax.
1	Syntax	The sentence "We investigated the area for bombs" is grammatically correct. In this sentence, "we" is the subject, "investigated" is the verb, "the area" is the object of the preposition, and "for bombs" is the prepositional phrase acting as an adverbial of purpose. The syntax structure is consistent and clear, making it a grammatically accurate sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence "I sensed his eagerness" is grammatically correct because it follows standard English syntax rules for subject-verb-object (SVO) word order. The subject ("I") comes first, followed by the verb ("sensed"), and then the object ("his eagerness"). Additionally, each word is morphologically correct and semantically meaningful, so there is no issue with morphology or semantics here.
1	Syntax	The sentence "They praised the dedication in the volunteers" is grammatically correct. In this sentence, "they" is the subject, "praised" is the verb, "the" is an article, "dedication" is a noun acting as the direct object of the verb "praised," and "in the volunteers" is a prepositional phrase modifying "dedication." Therefore, there are no syntax errors in this sentence.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct because it follows standard subject-verb-object word order (SVO) in English ("The earth" as the subject, "was believed" as the verb, and "to be round" as the object), uses appropriate tense ("was believed" indicates past belief), and has a clear meaning (that people used to believe that the shape of the Earth is spherical).
1	Other Category	The sentence "Sarah smiled a charming smile" is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple sentence structure (Subject-Verb-Object), where "Sarah" is the subject, "smiled" is the verb, and "a charming smile" is the object. Additionally, there are no errors in syntax, semantics, or morphology. Therefore, I have labeled it as 1 for being grammatically correct, and assigned it to the category "Other Category".
1	Other Category	The sentence "Sandra beamed a cheerful welcome" is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("Sandra"), a verb ("beamed") and an object ("a cheerful welcome"). The word "cheerful" describes the noun "welcome", making it an adjective phrase. This construction is often used metaphorically to describe someone expressing happiness or friendliness towards another person through their actions (in this case, by smiling broadly). Therefore, there's no mistake in terms of syntax, semantics, or morphology in this sentence.
1	Other Category	The sentence "You've really lived it up." is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("you"), an auxiliary verb ("have"), a past participle ("lived") and an adverbial phrase ("it up"). The meaning of the sentence is clear and unambiguous. Therefore, there is no mistake in syntax, semantics or morphology, so I will classify it as belonging to the category "Other".
0	Syntax	The verb "lift" needs a subject, but there isn't one provided in this sentence. A more appropriate way to phrase it would be "Paperback books can easily be lifted onto the table." or "One can easily lift paperback books onto the table."
0	Syntax	In this sentence, there is a subject-verb agreement error. The subject "books" is plural, but the verb "lifted" is singular. A plural subject requires a plural verb, so it should be "The books lifted **themselves** onto the table." or "They lifted the books onto the table." Additionally, if we want to keep the passive voice construction (which can sometimes sound more formal), then it would need to read as follows: "The books were lifted onto the table," where "were" agrees with the plural subject "books".
1	Syntax	The sentence "Jessica loaded boxes under the wagon." is grammatically correct. In terms of syntax, it follows the standard structure of a simple sentence, consisting of a subject ("Jessica"), an auxiliary verb ("loaded"), and an object ("boxes") as well as a prepositional phrase ("under the wagon"). All elements fit together coherently according to the rules governing word order and construction in English.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Jessica loaded boxes on the wagon" is grammatically correct. In terms of syntax (the arrangement of words to create meaningful sentences), it follows standard English structure: subject ("Jessica") + verb ("loaded") + object ("boxes") + preposition ("on") + destination ("the wagon"). Each word has a clear role and relationship with other words in the sentence, making it understandable and free from errors.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Jessica crammed boxes at the truck" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "Jessica" is a proper noun and serves as the subject of the sentence. It is correctly modified by her first name. * "Crammed" is the past tense of the verb "cram," which means to fill something tightly or press (something) into a small space. In this case, it agrees with the subject "Jessica." * "Boxes" is the direct object of the sentence, receiving the action of being crammed. It is plural because more than one box was likely involved. * "At the truck" indicates where the action took place. Prepositions such as "at" help clarify relationships between other words in a sentence. In this case, "truck" is a common noun used as the location for the action described. Therefore, there are no syntax errors in this sentence.
0	Syntax	The verb 'butter' requires a direct object (the thing being buttered), so the preposition 'at' is unnecessary here. A corrected version would be "Lora buttered the toast."
1	Syntax	The sentence "Carla shoveled the walk." is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "Carla" is a proper noun (names of people) and functions as the subject of the sentence. It is correctly spelled and capitalized. * "shoveled" is the past tense form of the verb "to shovel," indicating completed action in the past. This form agrees with the singular third-person subject "Carla." * "the walk" refers to a specific path or sidewalk, making it clear what was being shoveled by Carla. Articles ("the" and "a") help specify whether the noun they precede is general or particular. In this case, "the" indicates a specific walk. Overall, the syntax (sentence structure) follows standard English rules for word order and agreement between subjects and verbs.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Nora sent the book" is grammatically correct. In terms of syntax, it follows a typical Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) structure where "Nora" is the subject, "sent" is the verb, and "the book" is the object. All elements are properly arranged, making the sentence free from syntactical errors.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Nora sent Peter the book" is grammatically correct because it follows standard English syntax rules for word order (subject-verb-object) and includes all necessary components (noun phrase + verb + noun phrase). Additionally, the use of the definite article ("the") before "book" indicates a specific object being referred to, making the meaning clear. No morphological or semantic errors can be found in this sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Carla slid the book" is grammatically correct. In terms of syntax, it follows a typical subject-verb-object (SVO) structure where "Carla" is the subject, "slid" is the verb or predicate, and "the book" is the object. Additionally, each word is correctly conjugated for tense, number, and agreement, making the overall sentence syntactically sound.
0	Syntax	The sentence "Carla slid at the book" is syntactically incorrect because the preposition "at" is used incorrectly in this context. Typically, we slide on or over a surface rather than at something. A more appropriate way to phrase this would be "Carla slipped on the book." Alternatively, if she was moving past it quickly, "Carla slid by the book" could work as well.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Amanda carried the package to Pamela." is grammatically correct. It follows the standard subject-verb-object (SVO) word order in English and has a clear agency relationship between the subject Amanda and the object the package. Additionally, there is a prepositional phrase headed by "to" indicating where or to whom the action was directed. Overall, no syntactic errors can be identified in this sentence.
0	Syntax	The subject-verb agreement in this sentence is incorrect. The plural noun "packages" does not agree with the singular verb "drive." It should be either "Packages drives easily to New York" (if there's only one package driving) or "Packages drive easily to New York" (with a different meaning). In addition, it would be more natural to say "Package delivery to New York is easy," as it better conveys the intended meaning while adhering to proper syntax rules.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct. In terms of syntax, it follows a typical subject-verb-object (SVO) structure where "the chair" serves as the subject, "pushed" functions as the verb, but there's no explicit object indicated. However, based on context or world knowledge, we can still understand the intended meaning - someone or something moved the chair.
1	Syntax	The sentence "We offered a job to her." is grammatically correct. In terms of syntax, it follows the standard structure of Subject-Verb-Object (SVO): "we" as the subject, "offered" as the verb, and "a job" as the object. Additionally, the preposition "to" correctly introduces the indirect object "her". Therefore, there are no errors in the sentence's syntax.
0	Syntax	In English, a sentence typically consists of a subject and a predicate. The subject refers to the person or thing that is doing or being something, while the predicate expresses what the subject is doing or being. In the given sentence "A job offered," it's unclear who or what is offering the job because there is no explicit subject. Therefore, the syntax of the sentence is incorrect. To make the sentence grammatically correct, we could add a subject, such as "Someone" or "The company," to produce "Someone offered a job" or "The company offered a job."
1	Syntax	The sentence "Brown presented a plaque to Jones." is grammatically correct. In terms of syntax, it has a clear subject ("Brown"), verb ("presented"), and object ("a plaque"). Additionally, there is a prepositional phrase ("to Jones") indicating the recipient of the action. All elements fit together well to form a coherent and meaningful sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Carmen bought Mary a dress" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure for an English simple sentence (Subject + Verb + Object). In this case, the subject is "Carmen," the verb is "bought," and the object is "a dress." Additionally, the possessive form "Mary's" isn't necessary here as the sentence already implies ownership through its structure.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Carmen obtained the spare part at the hardware store" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Carmen," who is performing the action of obtaining something. The direct object of the verb "obtained" is "the spare part." Finally, "at the hardware store" tells us where the action took place. This sentence follows standard English syntax rules for word order (subject-verb-object) and includes all necessary components of a complete sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Michelle kept the desk with the papers" is grammatically correct. Here, "the desk" is the direct object of the verb "kept", and "with the papers" describes or modifies "the desk". This construction is called a prepositional phrase, where "with" is a preposition introducing the noun phrase "the papers". Overall, there are no syntax errors in this sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Frances hid the presents in the drawer" is grammatically correct because it follows standard English syntax rules. It contains a subject ("Frances"), a verb ("hid"), and an object ("the presents") all connected by prepositional phrases ("in the drawer"). Each word is correctly conjugated for tense and number, and there are no missing or extra words. Additionally, the sentence expresses a clear idea and meaning (semantic), each morpheme corresponds to its correct grammatical function (morphological). Therefore, I would classify this as a syntactically correct sentence.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct because it follows standard subject-verb-object (SVO) word order in English. Additionally, the verb "poked" agrees with its singular subject "needle," and the object "cloth" correctly receives the action of the verb.
1	Other Category	The sentence "Carrie touched that cat." is grammatically correct. Therefore, it returns a 1. It does not contain any syntax errors (incorrect arrangement or structure of words), semantic errors (logical inconsistency or meaninglessness), or morphological errors (issues related to word forms). Thus, the category for this answer would be 'Other Category'.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Herman whipped the sugar and the cream" is grammatically correct. In terms of syntax, it follows the standard structure of a sentence, having a subject ("Herman"), a verb ("whipped"), and two objects ("the sugar" and "the cream") connected by the conjunction "and". All elements are used appropriately according to their grammatical function, making the sentence syntactically sound.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Linda taped the picture to the wall" is grammatically correct. In terms of syntax, it has a clear subject ("Linda"), verb ("taped") and object ("the picture"). Additionally, there is a prepositional phrase ("to the wall") indicating where the action took place. All elements are arranged correctly according to English grammar rules.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Linda taped the picture onto the wall" is grammatically correct. In this sentence, "Linda" is the subject, "taped" is the verb, "the picture" is the direct object, and "onto the wall" is a prepositional phrase acting as an adverbial phrase modifying how or where the action was performed. This type of structure follows standard English syntax rules for simple sentences.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct because it follows standard subject-verb-object word order (SVO), where "the child" serves as the subject, "and" acts as a conjunction linking two nouns ("child" and "her mother"), and "clung" functions as the verb. Additionally, the agreement between the singular subject "the child" and its corresponding verb "clung" maintains number consistency. Lastly, the adverbial phrase "together" clarifies how they held on to each other. Therefore, no errors can be found regarding syntax, semantics or morphology in this sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence "This flyer and that flyer differ" is grammatically correct because it uses parallel structure by having two nouns ("this flyer" and "that flyer") connected by a conjunction ("and"), followed by a comparative adjective verb phrase ("differ"). Both subjects share the same predicate, making the sentence clear and concise without any syntax errors.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a grammatical error in its comparison structure. Instead of saying "differ apart," it should say "differ in some way" or simply "are different." Therefore, the corrected version would be either "This flyer and that flyer are different" or "This flyer and that flyer differ in some way."
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct. Here's why: * The subject of the sentence is "the jeweler," which is a singular noun that agrees with the verb "scribbled." * The verb "scribbled" is in the past tense and indicates completed action. It is transitive, meaning it requires a direct object. In this case, the direct object is "the contract." * The phrase "with his name" functions as an adverbial prepositional phrase modifying how the action was performed. Overall, the syntax of this sentence follows standard English rules for word order, agreement, and function.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a simple sentence (Subject-Verb-Object): "The gardener" is the subject, "grew" is the verb, and "that acorn into an oak tree" is the object. Additionally, each word's form is appropriate for its intended meaning and role in the sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence "I shaped a loaf" is grammatically correct because it follows standard English syntax rules. It contains a subject ("I"), a verb ("shaped") and an object ("a loaf"). Additionally, the tense of the verb agrees with the subject, indicating past action. Therefore, there are no syntactic errors in this sentence.
0	Syntax	In English, a verb must agree with its subject in number. In this case, the subject of the sentence is "the children," which is plural. However, the verb used is "amused," which is the past tense of "amuse" and is singular. A correct plural form would be "amused themselves" or simply "had fun." Therefore, the syntax of the sentence is incorrect as it does not follow the rules for subject-verb agreement.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Susan whispered the news" is grammatically correct because it follows standard subject-verb-object (SVO) word order in English. In this case, "Susan" is the subject, "whispered" is the verb, and "the news" is the object. Additionally, there are no spelling or morphological errors in the sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Susan whispered at Rachel" is grammatically correct. In terms of syntax, it follows the standard structure of a simple sentence, consisting of a subject ("Susan"), a verb ("whispered"), and an object ("Rachel"). Additionally, the preposition "at" indicates the spatial relationship between the action (whispering) and its recipient (Rachel). Therefore, there are no errors related to word order or arrangement in this sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Ellen said that melons were selling well" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Ellen," which is a proper noun and refers to a specific person. The verb phrase "said that melons were selling well" indicates what Ellen did or said. This clause contains another subordinate clause "that melons were selling well." Here, "melons" serves as the subject of the embedded clause, while "were selling well" functions as its predicate. Overall, the sentence has a clear structure and follows standard rules for word order and syntax in English.
0	Syntax	The sentence "Ellen said about the present conditions" is syntactically incorrect because it lacks a preposition after "about." A proper completion of the sentence could be "Ellen spoke **to me** about the present conditions," or any other object for "spoke". Without adding such information, it's difficult to determine whether there might be semantic errors as well; however, I can say definitively that this sentence requires some sort of direct object following 'about'.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Ellen warned Helen against skating on thin ice" is grammatically correct. In terms of syntax (the arrangement of words to create meaningful sentences), this sentence follows standard English structure. It contains a subject ("Ellen"), a verb ("warned"), and an object ("Helen"). Additionally, it includes a preposition ("against") followed by a gerund phrase ("skating on thin ice"). All elements are correctly conjugated and punctuated, resulting in a proper sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Cynthia nibbled on the carrot." is grammatically correct. Here's why: Syntax refers to the arrangement of words to create meaningful sentences. In this sentence, the subject (Cynthia) comes before the verb (nibbled), which agrees with the number of the subject (third person singular). Additionally, there is a preposition ("on") followed by its object ("the carrot"). This structure creates a clear relationship between the two elements, making it easy for the reader to understand who was doing the action (Cynthia) and what she did (nibble) as well as what she did it to (the carrot). Overall, the syntax of this sentence follows standard English conventions and allows for a natural flow of information.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Cynthia chewed" is grammatically correct. It consists of a proper noun (subject) "Cynthia," followed by a verb "chewed." Both subject-verb agreement and tense usage are appropriate for this simple sentence structure. Thus, it falls under syntax category as there are no issues related to word choice or meaning.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Paul laughed at Mary" is grammatically correct. In terms of syntax, it has a clear subject ("Paul"), verb ("laughed"), and object ("Mary"). The word order follows standard English rules (subject-verb-object). Additionally, each word is used correctly in context and there are no misspellings or missing punctuation marks. Therefore, I would rate this sentence as syntactically correct.
0	Syntax	The error in this sentence is syntactic because it has incorrect word usage due to a mismatch between the verb and the object. Specifically, "winking" typically involves closing and opening one's eyes quickly, so using "lip" as the object does not make sense grammatically or semantically (the meaning). To fix the syntax, we can replace "her lip" with something more appropriate such as "him a sly smile."
0	Syntax	In standard English, we would say "My heart is pounding" rather than "My heart is pounding me." The verb "pound" can take a direct object (as in "She pounded the dough"), but when used metaphorically as here to describe a feeling or sensation, it does not need one. Additionally, if we wanted to express the idea of something causing a physical reaction in oneself using a reflexive pronoun such as "me," we might instead use a different verb altogether; for example, "My heart is jumping/fluttering/skipping beats because I'm so nervous."
1	Syntax	The sentence "Sharon fainted from hunger" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules for English syntax. In this case, the subject ("Sharon") performs the action denoted by the verb ("fainted"), and a prepositional phrase ("from hunger") provides additional information about the cause of the fainting. All elements of the sentence fit together correctly, resulting in a coherent structure.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct because it follows standard subject-verb-object (SVO) word order in English, where the subject ("the witch") comes first, followed by the verb ("poisoned"), and then the object ("the children"). Additionally, all words are used appropriately according to their part of speech and meaning, making the sentence semantically coherent as well.
1	Syntax	The sentence "A grandfather clock ticked in the hallway" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules for English syntax (word order). Specifically, the subject ("a grandfather clock") comes before the verb ("ticked"), and the location ("in the hallway") is set off by a preposition ("in"). Additionally, the morphological agreement between the singular subject and the third-person singular present tense verb form is also correct. Overall, there are no semantic or other errors in this sentence.
0	Syntax	The verb "squeak" typically describes a sound made by something (or someone) other than the speaker. For example, we might say "The door squeaks when it opens." To indicate that the speaker caused the door to make a squeaking sound, we would use the construction "I squeezed the door (to make it squeak)." Therefore, without additional context or clarification, "I sqeaked the door" is syntactically incorrect because it implies that the subject ("I") has the property of being able to produce the sound associated with a squeaky door.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Over the fire there bubbled a fragrant stew." is grammatically correct. The syntax follows standard English rules for word order and structure. The subject ("a fragrant stew") comes after the verb phrase ("there bubbled"), but this is acceptable due to poetic license or stylistic choice. Overall, no grammatical errors can be found in this sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence “Soaring temperatures are predicted for this weekend” is grammatically correct. In terms of syntax, it follows the standard structure of a sentence, having a subject (“soaring temperatures”) and a predicate or verb phrase (“are predicted for this weekend”). Additionally, each word within the sentence is correctly spelled and uses appropriate punctuation. Therefore, I would classify this as syntactically correct.
1	Other Category	This sentence is grammatically correct, but it might be more appropriate to say that the flags were fluttering on the fort rather than the fort itself was fluttering. However, I can see how someone might use "flutter" in this way as a poetic device or figure of speech. Therefore, I will still mark this sentence as grammatically correct.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct because it follows standard English syntax rules for word order (subject + verb + object). In this case, "the voices" serves as the subject, "echoed" functions as the verb, and "in the hall" acts as a prepositional phrase modifying where the action occurred.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a simple sentence, consisting of a single independent clause. Here, "the stream" serves as the subject, while "twists" acts as the verb, connecting the subject to its description of moving through "the valley." Additionally, each word's morphological form is appropriate for its role within the sentence. Overall, no errors can be found regarding syntax, semantics, or morphology in this sentence.
0	Syntax	The verb "present" should be used as a transitive verb in this context, meaning it needs an object. A more appropriate way to phrase the sentence would be "A wonderful opportunity presented itself yesterday." This structure allows for the past tense of "to present" (i.e., "presented") to have an understood subject ("it").
1	Syntax	The sentence "A wonderful opportunity presented itself to him yesterday." is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "A wonderful opportunity" is a noun phrase that serves as the subject of the sentence. It consists of the article "a," the adjective "wonderful," and the noun "opportunity." * "presented" is a verb in past tense form, indicating that the action occurred in the past. * "itself" is a reflexive pronoun referring back to the subject "opportunity." This indicates that the opportunity caused its own occurrence, without external agency. * "to him" is a prepositional phrase acting as an indirect object, specifying who received the benefit of the opportunity. * "yesterday" is an adverb modifying when the event took place. Overall, the syntax (word order) is well-formed and clear, making for a proper English sentence.
0	Syntax	In English, we typically say "A little white rabbit jumped out of the box," rather than "Out of the box jumped a little white rabbit." The latter construction is possible in some languages (e.g., Russian), but it's less common and more likely to be perceived as incorrect or awkward-sounding in English. So, the sentence needs to have its word order adjusted for proper syntax.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct because it follows standard subject-verb-object (SVO) word order and uses proper tense agreement between the subject ("Penny") and verb ("skated"). The prepositional phrase "around the rink" adds additional information about where Penny was skating but does not affect the grammaticality of the sentence as a whole.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Jackie accompanied Rose" is grammatically correct. In terms of syntax, it has a clear subject ("Jackie") and predicate ("accompanied Rose"). Additionally, the verb tense agrees with the subjects (both are singular), and the word order follows standard English rules for declarative sentences.
0	Syntax	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in this sentence. In English, a singular subject requires a singular verb, while a plural subject requires a plural verb. Here, the subject "many information" is plural but the verb "was" is singular. It should be "Many pieces of information were provided."
0	Syntax	The noun "advice" is uncountable, so it should be used with a singular verb. The correct sentence should be "John offers much advice." or "John offers a lot of advice."
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct. It follows a clear subject-verb-object structure and uses proper comparative language ("more delicious") to compare two things (the cakes that Jones and Smith received). Additionally, the relative clause "that Jones got" and "that Smith got" modify the nouns "cake" appropriately. Overall, no grammatical or syntactical errors can be found in this sentence.
0	Syntax	The correct form of the verb to be after "recommend" when referring to a general group (in this case, people in general) is the third person singular form ("recommends"). Therefore, the grammatically correct version would be "We recommend that people eat less cake and pastry." Alternatively, for more informal contexts, it's common to use the imperative mood instead of recommending through the third-person singular form; in this case, the sentence could simply read "Eat less cake and pastry!"
1	Syntax	The sentence “I saw that gas can explode” is grammatically correct. Here’s why: * “I saw” is a verb phrase in the past tense indicating experience or observation. * “that” is a conjunction introducing a subordinate clause. * “gas can explode” is a verb phrase where “can” indicates ability and “explode” is the main verb in the subordinate clause. Overall, the syntax of the sentence follows standard English rules for forming a complex sentence with two clauses connected by a conjunction.
1	Syntax	The sentence "He washed her." is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "he," a pronoun referring to a male individual. The verb is "washed," a past tense form of the regular verb "to wash." This verb agrees with its singular subject in number. Finally, the object of the sentence is "her," another pronoun referring to a female individual. Therefore, there are no syntax errors in this sentence.
0	Syntax	The verb "wash" requires a direct object to complete its meaning, but there is no direct object in this sentence. A correct version could be "Wash **you**!" or "**You** wash.", where the subject and the object are clearly distinguished.
0	Syntax	The sentence "They have no in" is grammatically incorrect because it lacks a complete thought or predicate. A proper sentence requires both a subject ("they") and a verb phrase (such as "have nothing"). In its current form, the sentence has an incomplete verb phrase ("no in"), making it unintelligible without additional context.
0	Syntax	The pronoun "some" must be followed by a noun or gerund (verb ending in -ing). In this case, it looks like "some" is being used as an adjective before a noun, but there is no noun present for it to modify. A corrected version could be "Some of my jobs are in jeopardy."
0	Syntax	The verb tense is inconsistent in this sentence. "was" is past tense while "met" can be interpreted as either present or past tense. Additionally, there is a word order issue - it should be "that several young students met the policeman." Inversion (policeman-students) occurs when we use a question form ("Did the policeman meet several young students?"), but here we have a declarative statement.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains an error in subject-verb agreement. In the present tense, a singular subject requires a singular verb, while a plural subject requires a plural verb. Here, the subject 'the policeman' is singular, but the verb 'meet' is plural. A correct version would be 'did the policeman meet in the park?' or 'do the police officers meet in the park?'
1	Syntax	The sentence "John put old books in the box" is grammatically correct. In terms of syntax, it follows a standard subject-verb-object (SVO) structure where "John" is the subject, "put" is the verb, and "old books" and "in the box" are objects serving as the goal or destination for the action described by the verb. No grammatical errors can be found in this sentence from a syntactic perspective.
0	Syntax	This sentence is syntactically incorrect because it requires a linking verb such as "are" between "monkeys" and "proud." A corrected version would be: "The monkeys are proud of their leader."
0	Syntax	The sentence "John sounded very." is syntactically incorrect because it lacks a complement for the adverb "very" to modify. It would be grammatically complete if followed by an adjective or noun phrase (e.g., "John sounded very tired.") or an adverbial clause (e.g., "John sounded very well").
0	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically incomplete as it leaves the listener hanging about what specifically the speaker does not agree on. It could be improved by adding more context or information such as "I don't know if I should agree with the proposed solution."
1	Syntax	The sentence "John bought a book on the table" is grammatically correct. In terms of syntax, it has a clear subject ("John"), a verb ("bought") that agrees with the subject in number (singular), and a prepositional phrase ("on the table") that provides additional information about where the action took place. All these elements are arranged correctly according to English grammar rules, making the sentence syntactically sound.
1	Syntax	The sentence "John called the president a fool" is grammatically correct because it follows the basic structure of a simple sentence, i.e., Subject-Verb-Object (SVO). Here, "John" is the subject, "called" is the verb, and "the president" and "a fool" are both objects. Additionally, all words are used correctly in their proper forms, making the sentence syntactically correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence “I forgot how good beer tastes.” is grammatically correct. Here’s why: * The subject-verb agreement is correct (the singular subject “I” matches with the verb “forgot”). * The word order follows standard English syntax rules (Subject-Verb-Object). * The phrase “how good beer tastes” acts as a noun clause functioning as the direct object of the sentence. This type of construction is common in English when discussing abstract concepts or emotions related to something specific.
1	Other Category	The sentence "This teacher is a genius" is grammatically correct because it follows standard English syntax rules for word order (subject-verb-object) and has no errors in morphology or semantics. Additionally, there are no spelling or punctuation mistakes. Therefore, I have labeled this as "Other Category."
0	Syntax	The verb "remain" should be used in the past participle form ("remained") only when it's used as a passive voice or after auxiliary verbs (e.g., "has," "have," "had"). In this case, there is no need for using the passive voice, so the correct form would be "A good friend remains to me by him." However, even though grammatically possible, this still sounds quite awkward; instead, we could say "He keeps a good friend in me."
1	Other Category	The sentence "John ate his noodle quietly" is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple sentence structure: subject (John), verb (ate), object (noodle), and adverb (quietly). No errors can be found in syntax, semantics, or morphology. Therefore, it falls under the 'Other Category' label as there is nothing wrong with the sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence "A smith hammered the metal" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object (SVO) word order in English. The subject ("a smith") comes first, followed by the verb ("hammered"), and then the object ("the metal"). Additionally, each word is used appropriately and spelled correctly, making the overall syntax of the sentence unproblematic.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Sandy removed her ballet shoes" is grammatically correct because it follows standard subject-verb-object word order (SVO) in English and all words are used correctly according to their part of speech. Additionally, there are no spelling or punctuation errors. Therefore, I would rate this sentence as syntactically correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "This week will be a difficult one for us." is grammatically correct. The subject "this week" is followed by the appropriate verb tense "will be," indicating future time. The adjective "difficult" correctly modifies the noun "one." Finally, the prepositional phrase "for us" correctly shows the relationship between the rest of the sentence and its intended recipients. Overall, there are no syntax errors present in the sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Benny worked in a shoe factory when he was a student" is grammatically correct. In terms of syntax, it follows the standard structure of subject-verb-object (SVO), where "Benny" is the subject, "worked" is the verb, and "in a shoe factory" is the prepositional phrase acting as the object. Additionally, the clause "when he was a student" provides further context without disrupting the flow of the sentence or causing any confusion. Therefore, there are no errors in this sentence related to syntax, semantics, morphology, or other linguistic categories.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Everyone hoped that she would sing." is grammatically correct. The subject "everyone" is followed by the verb "hoped," and the clause "that she would sing" functions as the direct object of the sentence. This structure follows standard English syntax rules for forming a complex sentence with a subordinating conjunction ("that").
1	Syntax	The sentence "This proved a decisive factor" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "This" refers to something previously mentioned or implied, acting as the subject of the sentence. * "proved" is the past tense of the verb "to prove," indicating that what "this" refers to had already been demonstrated. * "a decisive factor" serves as the object complement, providing more information about the subject by describing it further. In this case, "decisive factor" specifies how "this" was important. The syntax (word order and structure) follows standard English conventions, making the sentence grammatically sound.
1	Syntax	This sentence is syntactically correct because it follows the rules for word order and structure in English. The subject ("the crocodile") comes before the verb ("devoured"), and the object ("the doughnut") comes after the verb. Additionally, each word is correctly formed and spelled.
1	Other Category	The sentence "John is afraid of Bill" is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple subject ("John") followed by a linking verb ("is") and a predicate nominative ("afraid of Bill"). The structure is clear and unambiguous, and there are no errors in grammar or syntax. Additionally, the morphological forms (inflectional endings) on each word are appropriate for their intended meanings and functions within the sentence. Therefore, I would classify this as belonging to the category of "Other."
0	Syntax	The sentence "John put under the bathtub" is grammatically incorrect because it lacks a preposition indicating where John placed something. A correct version could be "John put something under the bathtub."
1	Syntax	The sentence "John placed Kim behind the garage" is grammatically correct. The syntax is correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object (SVO) word order in English. The subject of the sentence is "John", the verb is "placed", and the object is "Kim". Additionally, the prepositional phrase "behind the garage" correctly modifies the action of placing by indicating where Kim was put.
0	Syntax	The sentence "Kim depends for Sandy" is syntactically incorrect because it lacks a proper verb to link "depends" and "for." A possible correction could be "Kim depends on Sandy," or "Kim does something for Sandy," depending on the intended meaning.
1	Syntax	The sentence "John put the book in the box" is grammatically correct. The syntax follows a standard subject-verb-object (SVO) structure where "John" is the subject, "put" is the verb, and "the book" is the object. Additionally, "in the box" serves as the prepositional phrase modifying either the verb or the object. Overall, there are no errors in terms of word order, agreement, or morphological form within this sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence "John taught English Syntax to new students." is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "John" is a proper noun and serves as the subject of the sentence. It is correctly modified by the verb "taught," indicating past tense. * "English Syntax" functions as the direct object of the sentence, receiving the action of being taught. Both words are capitalized because they begin a phrase acting together as a single unit. * "to" introduces the prepositional phrase "to new students," clarifying who received instruction from John. Prepositions such as "to" require objects (in this case, "new students") following them, creating prepositional phrases. * Overall, each word has been used appropriately according to its part of speech, forming a coherent structure without any grammatical errors or awkward phrasings.
1	Syntax	The sentence "John regards Bill as a good friend" is grammatically correct. In terms of syntax (the arrangement of words to create meaningful sentences), this sentence follows the standard structure of Subject-Verb-Object (SVO). Here, "John" is the subject, "regards" is the verb, and "Bill as a good friend" is the object. Additionally, the possessive noun "Bill's" would be used if we wanted to express ownership or association; however, using "as a good friend" here indicates a relationship between the two individuals rather than possession. Overall, there are no grammatical errors or awkward phrasings in this sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Kim put in the box" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "Kim" is a proper noun and serves as the subject of the sentence. It refers to the person who performs the action. * "put" is the verb of the sentence. It describes the action taken by the subject. * "in" is a preposition that indicates where the action takes place. * "the box" is a noun phrase serving as the object of the preposition "in". It receives the action expressed by the verb. The sentence has a clear structure and follows standard English syntax rules. Therefore, it is grammatically correct.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "the chickens," which is a plural noun followed by the appropriate verb tense, "seem." The predicate of the sentence contains another noun phrase, "of the farmer," which follows proper preposition usage. Therefore, there are no syntax errors present in this sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence "The rules require that the executives be polite" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "the rules," and the verb is "require." The subordinating conjunction "that" introduces a clause ("that the executives be polite") containing the subject "the executives" and the linking verb "be," followed by the adjective "polite." This structure is syntactically sound.
0	Syntax	The sentence "That Fred was unpopular nominated Bill" is syntactically incorrect because it lacks a proper verb tense agreement between the two verbs "was" and "nominated." Additionally, there should be a conjunction such as "and" or "who" connecting "unpopular" and "nominated". A possible correction could be "That Fred, who was unpopular, nominated Bill."
1	Syntax	The sentence "They were taking a hard look at possible FTA" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "They" refers to a group of people who are performing an action. In this case, the action is "taking." * "were taking" is the past continuous tense, indicating that they started and continued doing something in the past (looking). * "a hard look" means examining or scrutinizing carefully. It modifies the verb "taking," describing how it was done. * "at possible FTA" indicates what they were looking at. An FTA stands for Foreign Trade Agreement. Since we don't know if there are specific FTAs being referred to here, I assume that "possible FTA" is used as a general term.
0	Syntax	The phrase "against the book" is incorrect in this context. In this sentence, it seems like "the book" is intended to be the object of the verb "paid," but when using "against" in this way, we would typically use a gerund (verb+ing) instead of a noun or pronoun. A correct version could be "John paid me against accepting the book as collateral." However, even then, the usage of "against" might still sound awkward, so alternatively, one could say "John paid me for the book" or "John paid me to take the book."
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct. It follows standard subject-verb-object word order in English (SVO). The subject ("the committee") is followed by the verb phrase ("will study"), which describes the action being taken, and then the object ("the feasibility of setting up a national computer network"). Additionally, each clause has a clear subject and predicate, making it easy for the reader to understand what is happening in the sentence.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains an incorrect use of the verb "make." In English, we cannot typically use "make" to cause someone to behave rudely; instead, we would say something like "We made them act Rudely." Alternatively, if we want to say that our actions caused their rudeness directly, we could say "We made them rude (through some action)." However, without additional context or information about how the speaker's actions led to the other people being rude, it is difficult to provide a more precise correction.
1	Syntax	The sentence “After reading the pamphlet, Judy threw it into the garbage can.” is grammatically correct because it follows the rules for English syntax (sentence structure). It contains a clear subject (“Judy”), verb (“threw”), and object (“the pamphlet”) arranged in a logical order. Additionally, there is appropriate use of punctuation, including a comma after the introductory phrase, making the sentence easy to understand.
0	Syntax	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in this sentence. The plural noun "students" does not agree with the singular verb form "reads." It should be changed to "Student studying English read Conrad's Heart of Darkness while at university."
1	Syntax	The sentence "I read some of the book." is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "I" is a pronoun used as the subject of the sentence. It agrees with the verb "read". * "read" is a past tense verb indicating that the action occurred in the past. * "some" is a determiner modifying the noun phrase "of the book", implying that only part of the book was read. * "of the book" is a prepositional phrase acting as a complement to the word "some," specifying what was being referred to. Overall, the syntax of the sentence follows standard English rules for constructing simple sentences.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Most of the fruit is rotten" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "Most" is a determiner that indicates quantity or extent. It agrees with the singular noun "fruit." * "Of the fruit" is a prepositional phrase acting as an adjective modifying the subject "most," indicating which portion of the fruit is being referred to. * "Is" is the auxiliary verb used for third-person singular subjects, agreeing with the subject "most." * "Rotten" is an adjective describing the state of the fruit. The syntax is consistent throughout, making it a grammatically sound sentence.
0	Semantics	The sentence "Neither of students failed" is semantically incorrect because it lacks a proper negative polarity item (NPI) such as "any." A more appropriate way to phrase the sentence would be "Neither of the students failed," or "Not either of the students failed." In its current form, the sentence implies that both students passed, rather than neither failing, due to the absence of a clear NPI.
0	Syntax	In English, we must use an article (a, an, or the) before a singular, countable noun unless it has been specified previously. Therefore, the correct form would be "I drank some of the water" if referring to a specific body of water, or simply "I drank some water."
0	Syntax	The noun phrase "a golden hair" contains a determiner ("a"), an adjective ("golden"), and a head noun ("hair"). However, there seems to be no agreement between the singular determiner "a" and the plural form "hairs." Therefore, I would suggest changing it to either "a golden-haired person/creature" or "some golden hairs," depending on the intended meaning.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct because it follows standard subject-verb-object (SVO) word order in English, where the subject ("the boy") comes before the verb ("waved"), which in turn precedes the object ("to his father"). Additionally, all elements of the sentence have been properly conjugated for tense and agreement.
1	Semantics	The sentence "That dog is so ferocious, it even tried to bite itself" is grammatically correct but contains a semantic inconsistency. A truly ferocious dog would not normally try to bite itself as they typically attack others or external objects due to their aggressive behavior. Therefore, while syntactically sound, the content implies an unrealistic scenario, making it semantically incorrect. However, since there's no perfect category for such cases where reality contradicts grammaticality, I still mark it grammatically right (1) because its structure follows standard English rules.
0	Syntax	The verb "wash" requires an object pronoun (me, you, him, her, it, us, them) instead of a subject pronoun (I, he, she, we, they). In this case, the objective form "yourself" should be used as the reflexive pronoun for the second person singular. Therefore, the grammatically correct version would be "He washed himself."
0	Syntax	The sentence "John is easy to please Kim" is syntactically incorrect because it lacks a preposition such as "for" or "to" before the name "Kim." A correct version could be "John is easy to please (for) Kim" or "John is easy to be pleased by Kim," depending on the intended meaning. In the first corrected sentence, "easy to please" functions as a passive participial adjective phrase modifying "John"; in the second, "easy to be pleased" acts as an adjectival relative clause modifying "John" while "by Kim" serves as a prepositional phrase indicating who pleases John easily.
0	Syntax	The sentence is missing a noun after "intelligent." A complete clause requires both a subject and a predicate, but here there is only a verb phrase ("to be intelligent"). It's unclear what or who is being referred to as intelligent. In order for this sentence to make sense grammatically, it needs to include a specific subject such as "people," "students," etc., so that it reads, "There seemed to be intelligent people" (or students).
1	Other Category	The sentence "John tried to please Stephen" is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple sentence structure where "John" is the subject, "tried" is the verb, and "to please Stephen" is the infinitive phrase acting as the direct object. No errors in syntax, morphology or semantics can be identified in this sentence.
0	Semantics	This sentence is semantically incorrect because it contains a type error. The word 'fountain' refers to a physical object whereas 'be' typically requires an abstract concept or quality as its complement (e.g., 'believed John to be tall'). Therefore, the sentence cannot logically convey meaning.
0	Syntax	The subject ("it") does not clearly refer to a specific antecedent, making the sentence syntactically incorrect without additional context. Additionally, there is no verb agreement between singular "it" and plural "leave," so even if we assume a clear antecedent for "it," the sentence remains grammatically incorrect.
1	Syntax	The sentence "John tries to leave the country." is grammatically correct. In this sentence, we have a simple subject ("John") followed by a verb phrase ("tries to leave"). "Tries" is the third-person present tense form of the verb "try," which agrees with our singular subject "John." Following "tries," we have the infinitive marker "to" before the main verb "leave." Finally, we have "the country," serving as the object of the preposition "leave." Overall, there are no syntax errors or awkward phrasings in this sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Under the bed seems to be a fun place to hide" is grammatically correct. The prepositional phrase "under the bed" modifies the location where something (implied as "a fun place to hide") can be found. The verb tense agrees, with "seems" indicating a present-tense possibility or appearance. All elements within the sentence have been used correctly according to standard English syntax rules.
0	Syntax	The verb "is" or "are" needs to be added before "believed." Also, we need to use a plural noun after "there are," so it should say "sheep are" instead of "sheep in the park." A possible correction would be "It is believed that there are sheep in the park."
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a double modal error. In English, we cannot use two modals (would and do) together in one sentence without using another verb between them. A corrected version could be: "I hope to study in France." or "I would hope to study in France.", but not both together as written in the original sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence "John can kick the ball" is grammatically correct. In terms of syntax, it follows the standard structure of a simple sentence, consisting of a subject ("John"), an auxiliary verb ("can"), and an object ("the ball"). This structure allows for clear communication of meaning without any errors or ambiguities.
0	Syntax	In English, the subject (in this case, "John") cannot be the agent for a weather verb such as "rain." Only impersonal subjects can be used with these verbs; therefore, the sentence "John will rain tomorrow" is grammatically incorrect. The proper way to phrase this idea would be something like "It will rain tomorrow," since "it" serves as a placeholder subject when discussing the weather.
0	Syntax	The subject ("there") and auxiliary verb ("expect") do not agree in number; it should be "we expect there to be rain." Additionally, "will" is unnecessary as a future marker because "be going to rain" already conveys futurity.
1	Syntax	The sentence "John was found in the office" is grammatically correct. In terms of syntax, it follows the standard subject-verb-object (SVO) structure where "John" is the subject, "was found" is the verb phrase, and "in the office" serves as a prepositional phrase acting as an adverbial of place.
0	Syntax	The verb tense in the sentence is incorrect. In English, we use the past participle form ("been") instead of the base form ("be") after helping verbs such as "did." Therefore, the correct sentence would be: "Did the child BE in the school?" However, even with the correction, it's more common to say "Has the child been in school?" or simply "Was the child in school?" depending on the intended meaning.
1	Syntax	The sentence "It did not rain" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * The subject pronoun "it" refers to the weather or a general situation, which is appropriate for talking about whether it rained or not. * The auxiliary verb "did" is used correctly as a helper verb to form the past tense negative of the main verb "rain." * The negation particle "not" follows the auxiliary verb "did," making the sentence negative. * The main verb "rain" is a simple, regular verb that does not require any inflections or endings. Overall, the syntax of the sentence is well-formed and unambiguous, so there are no errors to be found here.
0	Syntax	The sentence "John wants not to leave the town" contains a double negative, which can result in unclear or incorrect meaning. A more clear way to express the idea would be to say "John doesn't want to leave the town." This eliminates the use of two negatives (doesn't and not) and makes the sentence easier to understand.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Mary likes to tour art galleries, but Bill hates to." is grammatically correct. It has a clear subject ("Mary" and "Bill"), verb ("likes" and "hates"), and object ("to tour art galleries"). Additionally, it uses proper punctuation and follows standard syntactical rules for constructing complex sentences using coordinating conjunctions (e.g., "but").
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a double negative ("needn't" + "not"), which creates confusion and makes it grammatically incorrect. A correct version could be "They don't have to take this exam." or simply "They need not take this exam."
1	Syntax	The sentence "Ann may spend her vacation in Italy" is grammatically correct. In terms of syntax, it has a clear subject ("Ann"), modal verb ("may"), main verb ("spend"), object ("her vacation"), preposition ("in"), and location complement ("Italy"). All these components form a coherent structure and follow standard rules for word order and arrangement in English sentences.
1	Syntax	The sentence "They love to play golf, but I do not." is grammatically correct. In this sentence, there is no error related to syntax, semantics or morphology. Therefore, it returns 1 for being correct. Additionally, since there is no mistake found, we cannot categorize the answer into any specific category, so other category does not apply here.
1	Syntax	The sentence "George has spent a lot of money, hasn't he?" is grammatically correct. It consists of an independent clause "George has spent a lot of money" followed by a tag question "hasn't he", which is used to confirm or check information already stated. The subject-auxiliary inversion in the tag question is necessary for it to be grammatical. Therefore, there is no error in syntax.
0	Syntax	The correct form of the verb to be after scarcely or hardly should be can (or could for past tense) instead of could. So, it should be "Scarcely could he do anything worth mentioning" (incorrect). However, what was intended to convey here seems to be that despite being a capable person, as a statesman, he couldn't do much because of certain limitations or circumstances beyond his control. In order to express that idea grammatically correctly, we would say something along these lines - "As a statesman, there was scarcely anything he could do worth mentioning."
1	Syntax	The sentence "We never found any of the unicorns." is grammatically correct. The subject "we" is plural and agrees with the verb "found". The word "any" is used correctly as a determiner before the noun phrase "of the ununicorns", indicating a negative polarity. Additionally, there are no obvious morphological errors or semantic inconsistencies in the sentence.
1	Other Category	The sentence "One of Korea's most famous pots wrote these lines." appears to be grammatically incorrect because it contains a typo where "poets" is misspelled as "pots". However, I assume that the intended spelling was "poets", so I will rate this sentence as correct since there are no other grammatical or syntactical errors present.
1	Syntax	The sentence appears to be grammatically correct. The subject ("somebody") has a verb ("struck"), and there is a direct object ("the unidentified victim"). Additionally, the time of the action is specified using a prepositional phrase ("during the early morning hours"). All elements fit well together syntactically, creating a coherent structure without any obvious errors or inconsistencies.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct because it follows standard English syntax rules for subject-verb agreement (the singular subject "car" matches with the past tense verb "was driven"). Additionally, the word order is appropriate for a simple declarative sentence expressing a completed action in the past.
1	Other Category	The sentence "Ricky can be relied on" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "Ricky" is a proper noun and serves as the subject of the sentence. * "can be relied on" functions as the predicate. It contains the auxiliary verb "can," followed by the present participle "being" (in the form of "be") and the past participle "relied." This structure creates a passive voice construction where the subject ("Ricky") receives the action described by the verb phrase. Therefore, there are no syntax, morphological, or semantic errors in this sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence "The bed was slept in" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * The subject of the sentence is "the bed," which is a noun phrase in the singular definite form. * The verb "was" indicates past tense and passive voice. It agrees with the subject in number (singular) and person (third). * The past participle "slept" functions as the main verb in the passive construction. It describes the action performed on the bed. * The preposition "in" introduces the prepositional phrase "in slept," which modifies the verb "was slept." However, it is more common to say "Someone had slept in the bed" or "The bed had been slept in" for clarity. Nonetheless, the original sentence is still grammatical but less idiomatic.
0	Syntax	The sentence "A pound was weighed by the book" contains a syntactic error because it implies an incorrect relationship between its subject ("a pound") and its verb ("was weighed"). Generally, passive constructions such as this imply that the subject has undergone some action or process, but here, it makes little sense for a pound to be weighed by a book since books are not typically used as units of measurement or instruments for weighing objects. Instead, a more appropriate formulation might be something like "The book weighed a pound," assuming contextual information supports this interpretation.
1	Semantics	The sentence "Who do you think Tom saw?" is grammatically correct. It is a question asking for the identity of the person that someone thinks Tom saw. The word order follows subject-auxiliary verb-subject-main verb (SBAR-AUX-NP-VP) pattern, making it syntactically correct as well. No morphological issues can be found since all words used are correctly inflected based on their intended meanings within the context of the sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence "he had spent five thousand dollars" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * He is a singular pronoun used as the subject of the sentence. It agrees with the verb spent. * Spent is the past perfect tense of spend, indicating an action completed before another past action (had). * Five thousand dollars is a noun phrase acting as the direct object of the sentence, receiving the action of the verb spent. Therefore, there are no syntax errors in this sentence.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a syntactic error because it lacks a proper subject-verb agreement. Specifically, there is no clear antecedent for the pronoun 'her'. Additionally, we need an article before the word 'politician' as it is a singular countable noun. A corrected version could be: "Fed knows which politician she should vote for."
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a pronoun "that" without an explicit antecedent (the word it refers back to). A more grammatical version would be: "How did you guess he had fixed the computer?" or "How did you figure out he fixed the computer?"
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct. It follows standard subject-verb-object word order (The committee knows), has a proper relative clause (whose efforts...), and uses correct verb tense and agreement throughout.
0	Syntax	The sentence is missing an "'s" or a "of" after "friend." A correct version would be "Which house does your friend's belong?" or "Which house is it that your friend of lives in?"
1	Syntax	The sentence "the baker from whom I bought these bagels left" is grammatically correct. It uses a relative clause ("from whom I bought these bagels") to modify the noun phrase "the baker." This type of construction is called a "wh-relative clause," and it is used to provide additional information about the noun it modifies. In this case, the wh-word "who" (which is implied in the form "whom") is used to introduce the relative clause, and it refers back to the antecedent "baker." The verb "bought" agrees with the subject "I," and the object of the verb is "these bagels." Overall, the syntax of this sentence is complex but well-formed.
1	Other Category	The sentence “I found the place where we can relax” is grammatically correct. It contains a subject (“I”), a verb (“found”), and an object (“the place where we can relax”). The tense of the verb indicates past action, and the word order follows standard English syntax rules. Additionally, there are no spelling or morphological errors in the sentence. Therefore, it falls under the category of “Other,” as it does not contain any issues related to syntax, semantics, or morphology.
0	Syntax	The phrase "with whom" already includes the preposition "with," so it's redundant to include another "with" before it. A corrected version would be: "Jack is the person whom Jenny fell in love." However, since many people find the use of "whom" formal or old-fashioned, a more commonly used form today would be: "Jack is the person Jenny fell in love with."
1	Other Category	The sentence “There is a bench to sit on” is grammatically correct. However, it could be improved for clarity by saying “There is a bench where one can sit.” Nonetheless, there is no error in syntax, semantics or morphology, so I will categorize it as “Other Category”.
1	Syntax	The sentence "I met the man who grows peaches" is grammatically correct. In this sentence, the subject is "I", the verb is "met", and the object is "the man who grows peaches". The clause "who grows peaches" modifies "the man" by providing additional information about him. This type of subordinate clause is called a relative clause, and it is set off by the relative pronoun "who". The syntax of this sentence follows standard English rules for word order and structure.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a pronoun error known as a missing antecedent. In this case, "his" does not have a clear referent in the sentence. A corrected version could be: "Which topic did you choose without getting Joe's approval?" or "Did you choose a topic without his approval?"
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a misplaced modifier error. The phrase "because Mary talked about" is a dependent clause that needs to be placed next to what it modifies. A correct version could be: "Which topic did you get bored talking about with Mary?" or "You got bored discussing which topic because Mary talked only about that for hours."
1	Other Category	The sentence “That is the reason why he resigned” is grammatically correct. It contains a subject (“that”), a linking verb (“is”), a predicate noun (“the reason”), a subordinating conjunction (“why”), and a tensed verb phrase (“he resigned”). All parts of speech are used correctly, there are no missing or extra words, and the word order is appropriate for standard English. Therefore, it falls under the category of other because it does not contain any errors related to syntax, semantics, or morphology.
1	Other Category	The sentence “It bothers me that John coughs” is grammatically correct. The word “bothers” functions as a linking verb here, connecting the subject (“it”) to the predicate (“that John coughs”). This type of construction can express various emotions or states such as annoyance, surprise, happiness, etc., depending on the context. Therefore, there aren’t any issues related to syntax, semantics, or morphology in this sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence "To please John is easy" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "To please" is an infinitive verb phrase acting as the subject complement of the linking verb "is." * "John" is a noun functioning as the direct object of the verb phrase "to please." * "Easy" is an adjective describing the degree of difficulty in pleasing John. Therefore, there is no syntax error in this sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Kim is eager to please Tom." is grammatically correct. It follows standard English syntax rules for word order and structure. Specifically, it has a subject ("Kim"), verb ("is") and object ("Tom"). Additionally, there is a prepositional phrase ("to please Tom") modifying the adjective "eager". Overall, the sentence demonstrates proper syntactic construction without any errors or awkwardness.
0	Semantics	The sentence is grammatically correct but the word "bites" is used incorrectly in this context. A more appropriate way to express this sentiment might be "That we invaded Iraq is regrettable." or "I really regret that we invaded Iraq."
1	Syntax	The sentence "It annoys me that Fido barks" is grammatically correct. In this sentence, "it" is a pronoun used as the subject, "annoys" is the verb, and "me" is another pronoun functioning as the indirect object. Additionally, "that Fido barks" is a subordinate clause modifying the verb "annoy." All elements of syntax are correctly placed within the sentence structure.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a misplaced modifier error. In this case, "who achieved the best result" is acting as a modifying phrase for the subject "Angela," but it has been placed after its intended noun instead of immediately before it (as would be appropriate for a short adjective phrase). A corrected version might read, "The person who achieved the best result was Angela."
1	Syntax	The sentence "It was the peasant girl who got it" is grammatically correct. In this sentence, "it" is a pronoun that refers to something previously mentioned or understood from context; "was" is an auxiliary verb used for passive voice; "the peasant girl" is a noun phrase functioning as the subject complement; "who" is a relative pronoun introducing a relative clause modifying "peasant girl"; and "got" is a past tense verb indicating that someone acquired something. Overall, the syntax (word order and arrangement) of this sentence follows standard English rules.
0	Syntax	The error in this sentence lies in subject-verb agreement. The subject of the sentence is "that kind of person," which is singular. However, the verb used is "are" which is plural. To fix this error, change "are" to "is": "That kind of person is hard to find anyone to look after."
1	Syntax	The sentence "A sick owl doesn't hunt mice." is grammatically correct as it follows the rules of English syntax. It has a subject ("a sick owl"), a helping verb ("doesn't"), and a main verb ("hunt") in the present tense. Additionally, the sentence contains a direct object ("mice"). All these elements come together to form a complete thought making the sentence syntactically correct.
0	Syntax	The subject-verb agreement in this sentence is incorrect. The subject of the sentence is "each candidate," which is singular, but the verb "will be admitted" is plural. To fix this error, change the verb to its singular form, as follows: "Each candidate who has an interest in semantics will be admitted to the department."
0	Syntax	The sentence provided contains a grammatical error related to subject-verb agreement. The plural noun "authors" requires a verb in the third person plural form ("provide"), but instead, the singular form ("provides") was used. Therefore, the corrected sentence would be: "Each author whose contribution is written in any language other than English will provide a summary in English."
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a subject-verb agreement error. The correct form of the verb "got" should be "have gotten" or simply "gotten," as the subject "we" is plural. Therefore, the corrected sentence would read: "I'm sure we have even gotten these tickets!"
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a double negative (even + didn't), which can result in confusing or unclear meaning. It would be better to use a positive statement instead. A corrected version could be: "I'm sure we have these tickets!"
1	Semantics	The sentence is semantically correct as it conveys a clear meaning. The speaker indicates that they assisted someone who engages in violent political activities within a city (urban guerilla), but their motivation was not due to having sympathy for them or sharing similar views. Instead, there might be another reason why they decided to help.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct. The clause "It isn't because Sue said anything bad about me" provides a reason for the speaker being angry, while the main clause "I'm angry" expresses the emotional state of the speaker. Both clauses contain appropriate verb tenses (past tense "said" and present continuous "am being"), subject-verb agreement, and word order. Additionally, the use of subordinating conjunction "because" connects two independent clauses properly.
1	Syntax	The sentence "That he was hungry, John whined" contains a subordinating conjunction ("that") introducing a dependent clause ("that he was hungry"). This type of construction is called a sentential complement, where the main verb in the matrix clause ("whined") takes a clausal object rather than a nominal or prepositional phrase as its complement. This structure allows for a clear subject-verb agreement within each clause while simultaneously linking both clauses semantically through cohesive devices such as conjunctions or intonational pauses (represented here by the comma). Thus, there is no syntactic error present in the provided sentence.
0	Syntax	In English, we usually follow the order subject-verb-object (SVO) when constructing simple sentences. The original sentence violates this rule by placing the indirect object ("Mary") between two parts of the verb phrase ("gave...a book"). A corrected version would be "I gave a book to Mary after the party" or even just "I gave Mary a book after the party".
0	Syntax	The phrase "as for" is used incorrectly in this sentence. A more appropriate way to express this sentiment would be: "Because she's so pleasant, I really like Mary." Alternatively, if the speaker wants to emphasize their liking for Mary specifically after mentioning someone else who shares a similar quality (being pleasant), they could say: "As for Mary, I really like her because she's so pleasant."
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the first clause is "he," the verb is "may hate," and the object is "those that criticize Carter." The second clause has a subject ("it") and a verb ("doesn't matter"). Both clauses are correctly connected using a comma followed by the conjunction "but."
0	Syntax	The subject ("With no job") and verb ("would be") in this sentence do not agree in number. A more grammatically correct way to phrase this thought might be "Without a job, John wouldn't be happy."
0	Syntax	The error in this sentence is related to subject-verb agreement. In the present tense, we generally use "has" instead of "have" when referring to a singular noun such as "much." Therefore, the correct form would be "I have much of the manuscript left to type."
1	Other Category	The sentence "He's a more reliable man" is grammatically correct. Here, "he's" is a contraction for "he is," and it serves as the subject of the sentence. "More reliable" functions as an adjective phrase modifying the noun "man." Thus, there are no syntax, semantic, or morphological errors in the sentence.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a subject ("any trouble") and a verb ("is"), but it lacks a proper object or complement for the verb. A more appropriate way to express this idea would be "I don't want any trouble" (with "any trouble" as the object of the verb "want").
1	Syntax	The sentence "They may grow as high as bamboo" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "They" refers to a plural antecedent (the subject being discussed), indicating proper use of pronoun-antecedent agreement. * "may grow" follows the standard form for expressing potential or possibility using modal verbs ("can," "could," "may," etc.) followed by the base verb form. * "as high as" functions as a comparative preposition here, comparing the height of something unknown to that of bamboo. This usage is idiomatic and acceptable. * "bamboo" serves as a noun functioning as the object of comparison after the comparative phrase "as...as." Its singularity does not affect the grammatical structure since it plays the role of a reference point rather than the direct object. Therefore, there is no syntactic error found in the provided sentence.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a syntactic error because there is no verb in the subject complement part of the sentence after "as." A complete thought or clause requires both a subject and a predicate (verb). Therefore, the corrected version would be: "Some of them made as many errors as they committed twenty."
0	Syntax	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in this sentence. In English, reflexive pronouns (e.g., myself, yourself, himself) must agree in number with their antecedents. Here, the antecedent is "Sally," a singular noun, so the reflexive pronoun should be "herself" instead of "himself." Therefore, the corrected sentence would read as follows: "Sally kissed herself."
1	Syntax	The sentence "Drew believes I think Rosie loves magazine ads." is syntactically correct because it follows the rules for word order and structure in English grammar. Each clause has a subject ("Drew," "I," "Rosie") and a predicate or verb phrase ("believes...loves"), and they are arranged correctly. Additionally, there are no missing words or extra words, and all punctuation marks are used appropriately.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Dave, Dan, Erin, Jaime, and Alina left" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules for subject-verb agreement (i.e., the plural verb "left" agrees with the plural noun phrase "Dave, Dan, Erin, Jaime, and Alina"). Additionally, each name is separated by a comma, which is appropriate for listing multiple people.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Hopefully, we'll make it through the winter without snow." is grammatically correct. It has a clear subject ("we"), an auxiliary verb ("will make") that expresses future tense, and an adverb ("hopefully") that modifies the whole sentence by indicating the speaker's hopeful attitude towards the event described. The word order follows standard English syntax rules, making the sentence easy to understand and interpret.
0	Syntax	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in this sentence. In English, a singular subject requires a singular verb form. The third person singular present tense verb should end in "-s" or "-es." Here, the plural form "show" is used instead of the required singular form "shows." A corrected version would be: "Blue leather shows that Betsy is pretty." However, there's still some ambiguity as it may sound unnatural since we don't usually say that objects (leather) show something; people do.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Gwen hit the baseball" is grammatically correct. In this sentence, "Gwen" is the subject, "hit" is the verb, and "the baseball" is the object. This forms a simple and complete sentence in English. Therefore, there is no mistake in terms of syntax or any other category (morphology, semantics).
0	Syntax	The correct form of the verb to be after the pronoun "you" is "know", not "hit". Additionally, there should be a comma after "that" for clarity. A corrected version would read as follows: "I hit (or perhaps saw or noticed), that you knew the answer."
1	Semantics	This sentence is grammatically correct. The disjunction ("or") connects two independent clauses, both of which have a subject-verb agreement (I've + lost). From a semantic perspective, it expresses a situation where the speaker has either misplaced their wallet or is mentally distressed. Both interpretations make sense in context.
1	Syntax	The sentence "It was a brand new car that he bought" is grammatically correct. In terms of syntax, it has a clear subject ("it"), verb ("was"), and object ("a brand new car"). Additionally, there is a relative clause ("that he bought") modifying the noun phrase "a brand new car." This clause contains its own subject ("he") and verb ("bought"). All elements fit together well and create a coherent sentence without any grammatical errors or awkward constructions.
1	Syntax	The sentence "He likes cookies and he hates crumb cake" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of subject-verb agreement and word order in English. The subject "he" agrees with the verb "likes," and "crumb cake" correctly follows the coordinating conjunction "and." Additionally, each clause contains a complete thought, making the sentence semantically correct as well. Therefore, there are no syntax, morphological, or semantic errors in this sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence "They chased the man with the car" is grammatically correct. In this sentence, "they" is the subject, "chased" is the verb, "the man" is the direct object, and "with the car" is a prepositional phrase modifying how they chased the man. This structure follows standard English syntax rules, making it a valid sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence "I didn't have a red cent" is grammatically correct. It uses the past tense verb "didn't have," which is the contraction of "did not have." This indicates that the speaker did not possess any money at a specific point in time. Additionally, "a red cent" is an idiomatic expression meaning "any amount of money." Overall, the syntax is correct as it follows standard English grammar rules for forming negative statements in the past tense.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a syntactic error. Specifically, there is no conjunction or clear relationship between "the book of poems" and "from Blackwell." A corrected version could be: "The book of poems and the one from Blackwell both take a very long time to read," or "Reading the book of poems and the one from Blackwell takes a very long time."
1	Syntax	The sentence "the one with a red cover takes a very long time to read" is grammatically correct. Therefore, I am returning 1. In terms of syntax, there are no issues with word order or structure in this sentence. All parts of speech are used correctly, and the sentence makes sense both syntactically and semantically.
1	Other Category	The sentence "John has a fear of dogs." is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple subject ("John") and a predicate ("has a fear of dogs"). The sentence expresses a clear relationship between these two components, making it syntactically sound. Furthermore, there are no morphological errors or ambiguities present in the sentence; all words are inflected appropriately for their intended meanings. Therefore, I would classify any issues related to this sentence under the category of 'Other', as it does not exhibit specific problems within syntax, semantics, or morphology.
0	Syntax	In English, we typically use a singular noun followed by a verb (in present tense) that agrees with the subject. Here, two nouns ("building" and "roof") are used together as if they form a single unit, but grammatically speaking, only "roof" is relevant for determining verb agreement. Therefore, it should be "The building's roof is leaking," instead of "*The building's the roof is leaking."
0	Syntax	The noun phrase "the panther's" contains a possessive form, indicating possession or association between "panther" and another entity (in this case, the coat). However, since there is only one panther being discussed, we do not need to use the possessive form here. Instead, we can simply say "The panther's coat is dark black." This would be grammatically correct, but it still includes redundancy because "dark" and "black" convey similar meanings. Therefore, I would recommend saying either "The panther's coat is dark" or "The panther's coat is black," depending on how much emphasis you want to place on each adjective.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Colin asked if they could get a mortgage" is grammatically correct. The subject "Colin" is followed by a verb "asked", indicating past tense. The word "if" introduces a subordinate clause, and the subject "they" is followed by another verb "could". This structure creates a question within the sentence, making it both syntactically and semantically correct. Additionally, there are no morphological errors present in the sentence.
0	Semantics	This sentence is semantically incorrect because it implies that the man who got into the taxi was the same person who later robbed the bank. However, since there's no context indicating that these two actions were performed by the same individual, we cannot assume they are related. In order for the sentence to be true, both clauses must refer to the same subject or provide enough information to establish a connection between them.
1	Syntax	The sentence “I know you eat asparagus” is grammatically correct. Here’s why: * The subject (“I”) and verb (“know”) agree in number (singular). * The word order follows standard English syntax rules (Subject-Verb-Object): I know (subject) + you eat (verb phrase) + asparagus (object). * All words used have their proper morphological forms for tense, agreement, etc. For example, the present tense form of the verb “to know” is used correctly here. * Furthermore, there are no semantic errors or ambiguities; each word contributes meaningfully to the overall sense of the sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence "John's drum will always bother me" is grammatically correct. Here, "John's drum" is a genitive noun phrase acting as the subject of the sentence, while "will always bother" is the auxiliary verb followed by the main verb "bother," all connected through appropriate tense agreement. Thus, there are no syntax errors present in this sentence.
1	Semantics	The sentence "An evil thought struck Dave" is grammatically correct. Here, 'an' is a determiner used before a singular countable noun starting with a vowel sound (in this case, /e/ as in 'evil'). The verb 'struck' is appropriate for the past tense, indicating that something happened previously. Overall, there are no syntax or morphological errors, and semantically, it conveys meaning without ambiguity; thus, I have labeled it as such.
1	Syntax	The sentence "In the classroom John put the book on the table." is grammatically correct. The syntax follows standard English rules for word order and structure. It contains a subject ("John"), verb ("put"), and objects ("the book" and "the table") arranged in a logical sequence. Additionally, prepositional phrases such as "in the classroom" provide further context without disrupting the flow or clarity of the sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Phillip gave the medal to the soldier" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a simple sentence (Subject-Verb-Object), where Philip is the subject, gave is the verb, and the medal and the soldier serve as the direct object and indirect object respectively. Additionally, each word is used appropriately within its context and there are no spelling or punctuation errors present.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a syntactic error because it lacks a proper verb tense agreement between the subject ("Heidi") and the main verb phrase ("thinks that Andy to eat"). Additionally, there should be a conjunction or preposition linking "Andy" to the infinitive verb form "eat". A possible correction could be: "Heidi thinks that Andy should eat salmon-flavored candy bars."
1	Syntax	The sentence "Heidi thinks that Andy should eat salmon flavored candy bars" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules for English syntax. Specifically, the subject ("Heidi") is followed by a verb ("thinks"), which is then followed by a clause ("that Andy should eat salmon flavored candy bars"). This structure is consistent throughout the sentence, making it grammatically sound.
1	Syntax	The sentence "He danced" is grammatically correct. The subject "he" agrees with the verb "danced" in number (both singular), and the word order is correct as well. Additionally, there are no spelling or morphological errors in the sentence. Therefore, it can be classified as syntactically correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence "Did Calvin his homework?" is missing a required auxiliary verb, typically "did" or "does", before the subject "Calvin". A more grammatically correct way to phrase the question would be "Did Calvin do his homework?" In English, we need to include an auxiliary verb when forming questions using simple present tense verbs (like "do"). Without it, the sentence becomes ungrammatical.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Sylvia was slapping Jeff upside the head in martial arts class" is grammatically correct. It follows the standard subject-verb-object (SVO) structure in English. The subject ("Sylvia") performs the action denoted by the verb ("was slapping"), which affects the object ("Jeff"). Additionally, there is a prepositional phrase ("in martial arts class") that modifies the verb, providing more context about where the action took place. Overall, the syntax of the sentence is well-formed, making it a valid English sentence.
1	Other Category	The sentence “If I am a rich man, I’d buy a diamond ring” is grammatically correct. It contains an example of first conditional structure (if + present simple, would + infinitive), which is used to express unlikely or hypothetical situations in the present or future. In addition, there is nothing wrong with the morphological formation of words and phrases, nor any semantic or syntactic errors. Therefore, it falls under the category ‘Other’.
1	Syntax	The sentence "If he were a rich man, he'd buy a diamond ring" is grammatically correct. It contains a subjunctive mood, expressed by the verb "were," indicating a hypothetical or unlikely situation. This construction is often used to express conditions or wishes. In this case, the condition is being wealthy enough to purchase a diamond ring.
1	Other Category	The sentence "John is likely to leave" is grammatically correct. It consists of a noun phrase ("John"), an auxiliary verb ("is"), an adverb ("likely") modifying the verb, and another infinitive verb phrase ("to leave"). All elements are correctly formed and arranged according to the rules of English syntax and morphology, and there are no semantic inconsistencies or ambiguities. Therefore, it falls under the category of "Other Category".
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the basic structure of a simple sentence (Subject + Verb). In this case, the subject is "The manager" and the verb is "laughed." Additionally, there are no spelling errors or incorrect word choices, making the morphological and semantic aspects of the sentence accurate as well.
0	Syntax	The sentence "Was sunk." is a fragment because it lacks a subject, making it syntactically incorrect. For example, a complete sentence could be "The ship was sunk."
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a tense shift from past ("did") to present perfect ("kissed"), which results in awkward and unnatural phrasing. A more natural way to phrase the question would be "Who had kissed the gorilla?" or simply "Who kissed the gorilla?"
1	Syntax	The sentence "Have you seen my model airplane collection?" is grammatically correct. The auxiliary verb "have" is used correctly as a helping verb to form the present perfect tense, along with the past participle "seen." The subject-verb agreement is maintained throughout the sentence, and there are no any other grammatical errors.
1	Syntax	The sentence "It seems that Lucy was mugged." is grammatically correct because it follows standard English syntax rules for word order and structure. Additionally, all words used in the sentence have been employed appropriately according to their part of speech and meaning, demonstrating proper morphological usage. Furthermore, there are no semantic errors present as each term holds a clear and unambiguous definition within the context of the statement. Therefore, I would classify any potential issues with this sentence under the category of syntax if they exist, but based on my analysis, none appear to be evident.
1	Syntax	The sentence “I ate a salad that was filled with lima beans” is grammatically correct because it follows the rules for English syntax (word order). In this case, the subject comes first (“I”), followed by the verb (“ate”) and then the object (“a salad”). Additionally, there is a relative clause modifying the noun phrase “a salad,” namely “that was filled with lima beans.” This clause has its own subject (“that”), verb (“was filled”), and object (“lima beans”), but functions as a single unit that describes the type of salad being referred to. Overall, all elements of this sentence have been used correctly according to syntactic conventions.
1	Syntax	The sentence "There were four men arriving at the station when I pulled up." is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "There were" is a correctly structured verb phrase for present tense plural passive voice. It agrees with its subject "four men". * "four men" is a correctly structured noun phrase where "four" functions as a determiner specifying quantity and "men" is a plural common noun functioning as head of the NP. * "arriving" is a gerund form of the verb "to arrive", used here as part of a participle phrase modifying the subject "four men". * "at the station" is a prepositional phrase acting as an adverbial complement adding information about location. * Finally, "when I pulled up" is another adverbial clause explaining time relation. This clause contains the past tense verb "pulled" (regular past tense formation from base verb "pull"), and it uses the auxiliary verb "I" followed by the past participle of pull ("up"). All these forms agree syntactically within their respective contexts.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Jean is reluctant to dance" is grammatically correct. In this sentence, the subject is "Jean," the linking verb is "is," and the predicate is "reluctant to dance." "Reluctant" is a adjective describing the subject's feeling towards dancing. Therefore, there is no error in syntax or any other category.
1	Syntax	The sentence "I want her to dance" follows the standard syntax rules for a subordinating conjunction ("want") followed by a subject ("her") and then an infinitive verb form ("dance"). All elements have been used correctly according to their grammatical function, making it a grammatically correct sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Jean persuaded Robert" is grammatically correct because it follows standard Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) word order in English. Additionally, the subject ("Jean") and verb ("persuaded") agree in number, as do the verb and object ("Robert"). No morphological or semantic errors can be identified in this sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Jean wants Bill to do the Macarena" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules for English syntax. In this sentence, "Jean" is the subject, "wants" is the verb, and "Bill to do the Macarena" is the object. This structure is a common pattern in English sentences and is grgrammatically correct. Additionally, the words are all spelled correctly and there are no missing or extra punctuation marks. Therefore, I would rate this sentence as 1, indicating that it is grammatically correct.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "the children," and the verb is "admire." The direct object of the verb is "their mother," which refers back to the subject through a reflexive pronoun. The syntax (word order) follows standard English rules for declarative sentences (subject-verb-object).
1	Syntax	The sentence "Who has Peter talked with?" is grammatically correct. It follows the standard structure for a question in English, where the subject ("Peter") comes before the auxiliary verb ("has"), and the main verb ("talked") follows the subject. Additionally, the use of the past participle form of the verb indicates that the speaker is asking about a completed action or event. Finally, the presence of the word "with" after the verb suggests that the speaker is interested in knowing who participated in the conversation along with Peter. Therefore, I would rate this sentence as 1 (correct) based on syntactic criteria.
1	Other Category	The sentence "Heidi likes her violin" is grammatically correct. Therefore, I am returning a score of 1 for this question. The labels 'Syntax', 'Semantics' or 'Morphology' would be more appropriate if there was something wrong with the grammar, meaning, or word formation respectively; however, none of these issues exist here, so it falls under an 'Other Category'.
0	Syntax	The error in this sentence is syntactic because it lies in the structure or formation of the sentence. Specifically, the pronoun "himself" does not agree with its antecedent "John." In English, reflexive pronouns (e.g., myself, yourself, herself) must agree in number and gender with their antecedents. Therefore, the correct form would be "John thinks that Mary loves him."
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a mistake related to pronoun-antecedent agreement. In this case, "hiself" doesn't agree with its antecedent "John." It should be "Which pictures of himself does John like?" or "Which pictures of him does John like?"
0	Syntax	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in this sentence. The verb "hunts" does not agree with its plural subject "any owls." It should be "Any owls hunt mice," so the label would be 1 if it was corrected. This error falls under syntax because it has to do with how words are arranged to form phrases and sentences correctly.
0	Syntax	This sentence contains a double negative ("any" and "didn't"), which results in a logically inconsistent statement. The corrected version would be "Not any man ate dinner," but this sounds awkward, so it would typically be rephrased as "No man ate dinner."
1	Syntax	The sentence "A pilot could be flying this plane" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "a pilot," which is a singular noun modified by the indefinite article "a." The verb phrase "could be flying" contains the auxiliary verb "could" indicating possibility or uncertainty, followed by the present participle form of the verb "to fly." This construction creates a passive voice structure where the doer of the action (the pilot) is separate from what is being done (flying). Finally, the pronoun "this" refers back to an antecedent implied in context. Overall, the syntax follows standard rules for word order and agreement between subjects and verbs.
1	Semantics	The sentence is grammatically correct and conveys a clear meaning. It states that everyone who went to last week's big rally signed the petition, regardless of their identity or affiliations. Therefore, there is no mistake related to syntax, morphology, or any other category.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Anybody who attended last week's huge rally signed the petition." is grammatically correct. It has a clear subject ("anybody who attended last week's huge rally") and verb ("signed"), as well as proper word order and agreement between subjects and verbs. Therefore, it does not contain any syntax errors.
1	Semantics	The sentence "Any tiger has orange fur, marked with black stripes." is grammatically correct but contains a factual error. While it's true that most tigers have orange fur and distinctive black stripes, there are exceptions. For instance, the South China tiger can be entirely white or black (melanistic). Therefore, the use of the word "any" implies that all tigers share these characteristics, making it semantically incorrect. A better way to phrase the statement would be: "Most tigers have orange fur, marked with black stripes." However, since the original question asks for a binary response indicating grammaticality only, I will still give it a score of 1 as it follows proper syntactic rules despite its semantic flaw.
0	Semantics	The statement "Any albino tiger has orange fur, marked with black stripes" is semantically incorrect because albinism is a condition characterized by the absence of melanin, resulting in white or pale hair, skin, and eyes. Therefore, it's impossible for an albino tiger to have orange fur with black stripes since they lack the pigment necessary for producing those colors.
0	Syntax	The verb "pick" requires a direct object, but there isn't one specified in the sentence. A corrected version would be: "You must pick (up) any flower you see."
1	Syntax	The sentence "Any pilot on duty today could be flying this plane." is grammatically correct. The word "any" is used correctly as a determiner before the noun phrase "pilot on duty today". The subject-auxiliary inversion in the clause "could be flying this plane" indicates that it is an interrogative sentence; however, it is being used in an embedded question within a conditional construction, so the sentence is still grammatical. Additionally, the verb tense is consistent throughout the sentence, with both clauses using the present tense. Therefore, there are no syntax errors in this sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence "You may pick every flower, but leave a few for Mary." is grammatically correct. It has a clear subject ("you"), verb ("may pick", "leave"), and object ("every flower," "a few for Mary"). Additionally, it uses proper punctuation and follows standard syntactic rules regarding word order and clause structure.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the rules for subject-verb agreement and word order. In both clauses ("The Dodgers beat the Red Sox" and "were beaten by the Giants"), the subjects (the Dodgers and they) and verbs (beat and were beaten) agree in number and tense. Additionally, the coordinating conjunction "and" connects two independent clauses, making the sentence a compound sentence. Overall, there are no errors in syntax or grammar.
1	Semantics	The sentence "In which car was the man seen?" is grammatically correct. It has a proper subject ("the man"), verb ("was seen") and preposition ("in"). The question asks about the location where someone saw the man, so it's semantically valid as well. Therefore, I returned 1 for this task.
1	Syntax	This sentence is syntactically correct because it follows the rules for word order and structure in English. It contains a subject ("the man"), a verb ("computed"), and two objects ("my tax" and "who Mary loves and Sally hates"). The relative clause "who Mary loves and Sally hates" modifies the noun phrase "the man", providing additional information about his relationships with Mary and Sally. Overall, the sentence is grammatically well-formed and easy to understand.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct. It contains a relative clause ("which Mary made") modifying the noun phrase "the kennel." The clause provides additional information about the kennel without interrupting the flow of the main clause. Additionally, subject-verb agreement is maintained throughout the sentence, as evidenced by "Mary made" (singular) and "has been stolen" (also singular).
1	Syntax	The sentence "Tom said he would and Bill actually did eat a raw eggplant" is grammatically correct. It contains two independent clauses ("Tom said he would..." and "Bill actually did eat a raw eggplant") connected by a conjunction ("and"). Each clause has a subject ("Tom", "Bill") and a predicate verb phrase ("said...", "did eat..."). Additionally, the use of the past tense "did" in the second clause emphasizes the contrast between what was said (by Tom) and what actually happened (with Bill eating a raw eggplant).
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct. It follows standard English syntax rules by having a subject ("the wealthy young man"), verb ("bought"), and object ("that piano"). Additionally, there is no incorrect word order or missing punctuation marks.
1	Other Category	This sentence is grammatically correct and has a clear meaning (semantic), the words used have the appropriate forms for their intended meanings (morphological) and there is no error in word order or phrase structure (syntactic). Therefore, it does not fit neatly into any specific category but rather serves as a simple example of proper English usage.
1	Other Category	The sentence "a tall building" is grammatically correct, but it seems to be missing some context or additional information to make it a complete thought or statement. On its own, without any further context, it's difficult to determine if there are any specific syntax, semantic, or morphological issues present. However, since no errors can currently be identified based on the provided input, I have labeled it as grammatically correct (1) and categorized it under "Other Category."
1	Other Category	The sentence "This building is tall" is grammatically correct. It consists of a subject ("this building"), a linking verb ("is"), and a predicate adjective ("tall"). No errors can be found regarding syntax (the arrangement of words), semantics (meaningful use of language), or morphological issues (word structure). Thus, it falls under the 'Other Category' as no specific error category applies here.
1	Syntax	The sentence "I like the book which you gave me." is grammatically correct. In terms of syntax, it follows the structure Subject-Verb-Object (SVO), where "I" is the subject, "like" is the verb, and "the book which you gave me" is the object. Additionally, the relative clause "which you gave me" modifies the noun phrase "the book," providing more information about the book's origin. Overall, the sentence has a clear meaning and appropriate word order.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Captain Wentworth wrote a letter to Anne Elliott" is grammatically correct because it follows standard English syntax rules. In this simple sentence, we have a subject (Captain Wentworth), verb (wrote), and object (a letter). Additionally, there's a prepositional phrase starting with "to," further clarifying who received the letter. All elements work together coherently without any apparent morphological or semantic issues.
0	Syntax	In English, auxiliary (or helping) verbs such as "was" should come before the subject when forming a question. The subject ("Alison") should follow the auxiliary verb. Therefore, the correct version of this sentence would be "She asked **was** Alison **coming** to the party?" I have corrected the order of "was" and "Alison."
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct. Here's a breakdown of the syntax: * "They" is the subject of the sentence. * "realized" is the verb, in past tense. * "that" introduces a subordinate clause. * "never" is an adverb modifying the verb phrase "had been offended." * "had been offended" is the passive form of the verb phrase "to offend," indicating that something happened to Sir Thomas rather than him doing it himself. * "Sir Thomas" is the object of the subordinate clause. * "so" is an intensifier modifying "offended." * "offended" is the past participle form of the verb "to offend." Therefore, based on the structure and word choice, the sentence is grammatically sound.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Fanny regretted having to talk to Aunt Norris" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Fanny," who is performing the action of regretting something (in this case, "having to talk to Aunt Norris"). This clause ("Fanny regretted") serves as the main verb phrase of the sentence. Following it is a gerund clause ("having to talk to Aunt Norris"), which functions as the direct object of the main verb phrase. A gerund is a verb form ending in "-ing" that functions as a noun; here, "talking" serves as the headword of the gerund clause and takes on the role of the direct object within that clause. Overall, the syntax of the sentence follows standard English rules for word order, grammatical function, and phrasing.
1	Other Category	The sentence "Knowing the country well, he took a shortcut" is grammatically correct. It contains a dependent clause ("knowing the country well") followed by an independent clause ("he took a shortcut"). This structure is often used to provide additional context or background information about the subject of the main clause. In this case, the speaker is emphasizing that the person's knowledge of the country allowed them to take a shorter route. No errors can be found in terms of syntax, semantics, or morphology.
1	Semantics	The sentence "He left the train with somebody else's wallet in his pocket" is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("he"), a verb ("left"), an object ("the train") and a prepositional phrase ("with somebody else's wallet in his pocket"). The meaning of the sentence is clear - it describes an action taken by someone who unknowingly took another person's wallet while leaving a train. Therefore, there is no mistake in terms of syntax, morphology or semantics.
1	Other Category	The sentence "Magnus went to Ireland" is grammatically correct. Therefore, it returns a score of 1. Since there are no syntactic, semantic, or morphological errors present in the sentence, we will categorize this under 'Other Category'.
0	Syntax	The sentence "Who did John send the book?" is grammatically incorrect because it lacks a proper question word order. In English, questions typically begin with an auxiliary verb (in this case, "did") followed by the subject ("John"), then the main verb ("send"), and finally the object ("the book"). A corrected version would be: "Who did John send the book to?" or "To whom did John send the book?"
0	Syntax	This sentence contains a subject-verb agreement error. The subject "the idea" is singular, so the verb should be the third person singular form "dismays." Therefore, the corrected sentence would read as follows: "The idea dismays the Prime Minister that the Dome is dull."
0	Syntax	The sentence contains an incorrect verb tense agreement error. The past tense form of the verb 'come' should be used instead of the base form 'come'. Also, there should be a comma after 'without', making it "Came right in he did, without so much as a knock." However, even if these corrections are made, the sentence would still sound awkward because of its word order and lack of pronoun-antecedent agreement. A better way to phrase this sentence could be "He came right in without so much as a knock."
1	Syntax	The sentence "Harriet admired Mr Knightley" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "Harriet" is a proper noun referring to a female character, serving as the subject of the sentence. * "admired" is a verb in past tense form, indicating that Harriet performed an action on someone or something else. * "Mr Knightley" is another proper noun, acting here as the direct object since it receives the action from the verb. Together they constitute a simple declarative sentence that follows standard English syntax rules.
1	Other Category	This sentence is grammatically correct. It consists of a noun phrase ("the book") and an adjective ("boring"). No errors can be found regarding syntax (word order), semantics (meaning) or morphology (structure of words). Therefore, it falls under the category 'Other'. Additionally, the statement might simply reflect someone's opinion about a particular book being dull or uninteresting.
1	Other Category	The sentence "Ethel wishes to ask you some awkward questions." is grammatically correct. It has a clear subject ("Ethel"), verb ("wishes"), and object ("some awkward questions"). Additionally, it uses proper punctuation and capitalization. Therefore, there are no errors related to syntax, semantics, or morphology.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Emma made Harriet some food" is grammatically correct. In terms of syntax, it follows the standard Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) word order found in English, where "Emma" is the subject, "made" is the verb, and "Harriet some food" serves as the object complement. No grammatical errors or awkward constructions can be identified here.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object (SVO) word order in English, where the subject ("the window") comes before the verb ("was broken"), which in turn comes before the object ("with a hammer"). Additionally, the tense of the verb agrees with the time frame established by the context of the sentence. In summary, there are no syntactic errors present in this sentence.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct. It follows standard subject-verb-object word order (fugitive - lay - discovery), and all elements agree in number. Additionally, the prepositional phrase "in order to avoid discovery" provides clear context for why the fugitive might be lying motionless. No errors can be found in morphological form or semantic meaning.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct because it follows standard subject-verb-object (SVO) word order, where "the guard" serves as the subject, "marched" functions as the verb, and "the prisoners" and "round the yard" serve as the direct object and prepositional phrase respectively. Additionally, each word's morphological form agrees with its function within the sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Frank Churchill crossed the street" is grammatically correct because it follows standard subject-verb-object (SVO) word order and has proper tense agreement between the subject ("Frank Churchill") and verb ("crossed"). Additionally, all words used in their appropriate forms contribute to a coherent meaning without any ambiguity or contradiction, indicating semantic accuracy as well. Overall, no morphological errors can be identified either.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Emma and Harriet were attacked yesterday" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Emma and Harriet," which is a noun phrase consisting of two proper nouns connected by the coordinating conjunction "and." This structure is syntactically correct because it follows the rules for forming phrases and clauses in English grammar. Additionally, the verb "were attacked" agrees with the plural subject "Emma and Harriet" in number. Finally, the time adverbial "yesterday" provides additional information about when the action took place. Overall, there are no syntax errors in this sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Fiona might be here by 5 o'clock." is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "Fiona" is a proper noun, so it is capitalized correctly. * "might be" indicates uncertainty about whether or not Fiona will arrive by 5 o'clock, and is therefore used appropriately. * "here" implies location or presence, and is appropriate for indicating where Fiona may be. * "by 5 o'clock" specifies a time frame for when Fiona could potentially arrive, using the preposition "by" followed by a specific time expression. This use of language is clear and unambiguous.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct. It contains two independent clauses connected by the coordinating conjunction "and". Each clause has its own subject ("I") and verb phrase ("am expecting" and "is of the opinion"). Additionally, each clause expresses a complete thought, making the sentence semantically correct as well.
1	Semantics	The sentence “Pat was awarded the Golden Fleece Award and very upset about it” is grammatically correct but contains a semantic inconsistency. It implies that Pat received an award (the Golden Fleece Award) and was unhappy about it simultaneously. This contradiction suggests that Pat's feelings towards receiving the award might be more complex than simply being happy or sad. However, without further context or clarification, it cannot be definitively determined whether the sentence is factually accurate or if there has been some error made during its composition. Nonetheless, as far as grammar and syntax are concerned, the sentence is perfectly acceptable.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a mix of simple present tense ("alienates") and base form verbs ("beating"). To maintain consistency and make the sentence grammatically correct, we need to use either simple present or base form for all verbs. Here's a corrected version using simple present: "Kim alienates cats and beats his dog." Alternatively, here's another option using base forms: "Kim alienates cats and hits his dog."
1	Syntax	The sentence "They knew that pictures of each other would be on sale" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules for subject-verb agreement, word order, and punctuation. In particular, the subjects "they" and "pictures" agree with their respective verbs "knew" and "would be," and the phrase "of each other" correctly modifies the noun "pictures." Additionally, there are no missing or extra words, and the sentence ends with a period as required by standard written English. Therefore, I have labeled this sentence as 1 (correct) based on its syntax.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a pronoun "which" that does not clearly refer to a specific noun earlier in the sentence. A more clear version would be something like "Terry filed some papers without reading them first. Which articles did he do this for?" or "Which articles did Terry file without reading beforehand?"
1	Other Category	The sentence "I want to try and buy some whisky" is grammatically correct. In this case, there is a choice between using "try to do something" or "try and do something." Both constructions have similar meanings but can sometimes result in slightly different interpretations based on context. However, both forms are widely used and accepted. Therefore, it falls under the 'Other Category' since neither syntax, semantics nor morphology errors are present.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a syntactic error. In particular, there is no verb after "buying." A corrected version could be "She goes and buys some whiskey" or "She goes to buy some whiskey," depending on what was intended by the original speaker or writer.
0	Syntax	The subject of the sentence "Kim and Terry" is plural, so the verb needs to be in its plural form as well. Therefore, instead of "is", it should say "are". A corrected version would read: "Kim and Terry are happy."
1	Syntax	The sentence "Kim gave a dollar to Bobbie and a dime to Jean" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of English syntax. Specifically, it contains two independent clauses ("Kim gave a dollar to Bobbie" and "a dime to Jean") connected by a coordinating conjunction ("and"). Each clause has a subject ("Kim," "a dime") and a verb phrase ("gave a dollar to Bobbie," "to Jean"), following the typical structure of an English sentence (Subject-Verb-Object). Additionally, both instances of "to" function as prepositions introducing prepositional phrases, further clarifying who received what amount from Kim. Overall, the sentence demonstrates proper syntactic construction without any errors.
1	Syntactic Ambiguity	The sentence does not contain any grammatical or spelling errors; however, it contains a syntactic ambiguity where it's unclear whether "and on your desk" modifies "the mailbox" or "a picture of Bill." Therefore, the intended meaning may be misunderstood by some readers. To avoid confusion, rephrasing can help, such as "This girl in the red coat will put a picture of Bill in the mailbox and also leave another picture of him on your desk before tomorrow."
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct. It contains two independent clauses, "Put a picture of Bill on your desk before tomorrow" and "this girl in the red coat will put a picture of Bill on your desk before tomorrow," connected by a conjunction ("and"). Both clauses follow standard subject-verb-object word order and use appropriate verb tenses (present simple for the first clause and future for the second). Additionally, all punctuation and articles are used correctly.
1	Other Category	The sentence appears grammatically correct, but it could be improved for clarity. Specifically, it would be clearer if "this girl" was replaced with a pronoun such as "she," so that it's clear who the subject of the second clause is. Additionally, it might be helpful to specify whose desk the picture will be placed on. So, a revised version of the sentence could be: "The girl in the red coat will put a picture of Bill on your desk before tomorrow." However, since the original sentence does contain all necessary grammatical components and can still be understood, I have labeled it as correct (1) overall.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Ann bought a first edition of Richard III for $1000." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of syntax. In this case, the subject (Ann) is followed by a verb (bought), and then there is a direct object (a first edition of Richard III). Finally, we have a prepositional phrase (for $1000) modifying the verb. All these elements form a complete sentence with proper syntactic structure.
1	Other Category	The sentence "John became deadly afraid of flying" is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple tense verb phrase ("became") followed by an adjective ("deadly afraid") functioning as the object complement and completing the predicate. This structure correctly conveys the intended meaning (semantics), and there are no issues related to word formation or inflection (morphology). Therefore, I would classify any errors found here under an 'Other' category since none of the provided labels directly apply. However, if pressed for specifics, one might argue that the use of "deadly" could potentially be questioned on semantic grounds; typically, "afraid" alone suffices to convey fear without needing intensifiers such as "deadly." But even so, its usage does not make the overall sentence incorrect.
1	Syntax	The sentence "What John promised is to be gentle." is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "what" functions as a relative pronoun referring back to an antecedent (which is implied here). It introduces a clause ("what John promised") functioning as the subject of the sentence. * "John" is a proper noun used as the subject of the relative clause. * "promised" is a past tense verb agreeing with the subject "John". * "is" is a linking verb connecting the subject "what John promised" with its complement "to be gentle". * "to be gentle" is an infinitive phrase acting as the complement of the linking verb "is", specifying what it is that John promised. So there are no syntax errors in this sentence.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a missing article before the word "books." A more grammatically correct version would be "Henri wants to buy which **cooking** books?" or "Henri wants to buy which books about **cooking**?"
1	Syntax	The sentence "I will fix the computer for Carol" is grammatically correct. The subject "I" is followed by a verb tense "will fix," indicating future action. The direct object "the computer" receives the action of the verb. The prepositional phrase "for Carol" provides additional information about the action being taken. All elements are arranged correctly according to syntactic rules, so no errors exist in terms of syntax.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Smith loaned a valuable collection of manuscripts to the library" is grammatically correct. In terms of syntax, it has a clear subject ("Smith"), a verb ("loaned") and an object ("a valuable collection of manuscripts"). Additionally, there is a prepositional phrase ("to the library") indicating where or to whom the action was performed. All these elements work together seamlessly to create a well-structured and coherent sentence.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct. It follows the standard subject-verb-object (SVO) word order in English. The subject ("Mary") comes first, followed by the verb ("is cut"), and then the object ("the paper"). Additionally, there are no spelling or morphological errors in the sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence "It was from six to nine or it took place from six to nine" is grammatically correct. Both clauses "it was from six to nine" and "it took place from six to nine" are syntactically well-formed. However, the sentence could be improved by removing the conjunction "or," as there's no need for it since only one clause is being used. So a better version would be: "It took place from six to nine." Nonetheless, the original sentence remains grammatically correct despite its redundancy.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Suddenly, there arrived two inspectors from the INS." is grammatically correct. Here's a breakdown of why it's correct: * "Suddenly" is an adverb modifying how the action (of arriving) happened. * "There" is used as a placeholder for the subject ("two inspectors") which will be introduced later in the sentence. This structure is called existential construction or expletive construction, which is common in English. * "arrived" is the verb agreeing with the plural noun "inspectors". It indicates the completion of the action. * "two inspectors" is the grammatical subject of the sentence; "from the INS" describes where they came from. The syntax of the sentence follows standard English rules without any errors.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct. It consists of two independent clauses ("The soup cooks" and "thickens") joined by a comma, which follows a common punctuation rule for compound sentences. Each clause contains a subject ("the soup" and no expressed subject) and a verb ("cooks" and "thickens"), making them both complete thoughts. Additionally, since these actions occur simultaneously or consecutively during the cooking process, it's appropriate to use the present continuous tense ("is cooking" could be used instead of "cooks," but leaving out "is" doesn't change the meaning).
1	Syntax	The sentence "I gave money to the charity" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "I", the verb is "gave", and the object is "money". The prepositional phrase "to the charity" indicates where or to whom the action was directed. This structure follows standard English syntax rules for simple sentences.
1	Other Category	The sentence "John asked." is grammatically correct. It consists of a noun phrase ("John") and a verb in past tense form ("asked"). No errors can be found regarding syntax (word order), semantics (meaningful use of words) or morphological inflections (proper word forms).
0	Semantics	The sentence "I saw even the student" is semantically incorrect because the word "even" is used incorrectly. In this context, "even" suggests a surprising or unexpected situation, implying that seeing the student was somehow remarkable. However, there's no such indication provided by the rest of the sentence. To make it grammatically and semantically correct, we could rephrase it as "I even saw the student." This implies that observing the student was somewhat notable among other things seen during the relevant time frame.
0	Syntax	The sentence "John whispered Mary left" is syntactically incorrect because it lacks a main verb for the subject "John." In order for the sentence to be grammatically correct, we need to add a main verb such as "whispered" after "John," so the corrected version would be "John whispered, 'Mary left.'" Alternatively, if we want to indicate that John was whispering about Mary leaving rather than actually whispering her name, then we could use a conjunction such as "that" or "when" to connect the two clauses, resulting in a sentence like "John whispered that/when Mary had left."
0	Syntax	The sentence "Mary wonders that Bill will come" contains a syntactic error. In English, when using the verb "wonder," it's typically followed by a direct object or a clause without "that." A more grammatically correct version would be "Mary wonders whether Bill will come" or "Mary wonders about Bill coming."
0	Syntax	The sentence "Sophie will theater" is grammatically incorrect because it lacks a verb in its infinitive form after "will." A more appropriate way to phrase the sentence would be "Sophie will go to the theater," or if she herself is performing, "Sophie will perform at the theater." In its current state, the word "theater" functions as both a noun and a verb simultaneously, causing confusion for the reader. This error results from improper syntax within the sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence "John finished the cake and drank the lemonade" is grammatically correct. It follows the basic structure of a simple sentence, consisting of a subject ("John"), a verb ("finished", "drank") and two objects ("the cake", "the lemonade"). Additionally, it uses a coordinating conjunction ("and") to connect two independent clauses together, making it syntactically sound.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Herself likes Mary's mother" is grammatically correct in terms of syntax because it follows the rules for forming a simple sentence (subject + verb + object). However, using "herself" as the subject creates some ambiguity since it typically refers to the same person as the reflexive pronoun used later in the sentence. In this case, though, there is no earlier use of a similar reflexive pronoun to clarify who "herself" refers to. So while syntactically correct, semantically it could be clearer. A better way to phrase this might be "Mary likes her own mother."
1	Syntax	The sentence "Each of the boys fought with some of the other boys" is grammatically correct. In terms of syntax, it follows the rules for forming a sentence in English. It has a subject ("each of the boys"), a verb ("fought") and an object ("some of the other boys"). Additionally, the use of "each" indicates that each individual boy was involved in fighting, while "some of the other boys" specifies that there were multiple opponents. This level of specificity helps clarify any potential ambiguity, making the sentence even more syntactically sound.
0	Syntax	The reflexive pronoun used in this sentence does not agree with its antecedent. In this case, "himself" should be replaced by a regular third-person singular personal pronoun (i.e., "he"). Therefore, the corrected version would read as follows: "John's mother likes him." This error is related to syntax since it concerns word order and arrangement within a sentence.
0	Syntax	The subject of the sentence "Mary" is a female name, so it should be followed by a reflexive pronoun that agrees in gender. Therefore, the grammatically correct form would be "Mary revealed herself to John."
1	Syntax	The sentence "Mary believes that Bill saw himself" is grammatically correct. In terms of syntax, it follows the structure of a complex sentence with a dependent clause ("that Bill saw himself") and an independent clause ("Mary believes"). Additionally, the reflexive pronoun "himself" correctly refers back to "Bill," indicating that he was both the subject and object of the action described by the verb "saw."
1	Syntax	The sentence "John heard that they criticized themselves" is grammatically correct. In terms of syntax, it follows the rules for word order and structure in English. The subject "John" comes before the verb "heard," and the clause "that they criticized themselves" correctly functions as the direct object of the sentence. Additionally, each word is used appropriately in its intended grammatical function (nouns, verbs, pronouns, etc.). Therefore, there are no syntactic errors in this sentence.
1	Other Category	The sentence "Mary thinks that she is smart" is grammatically correct. Therefore, I am returning a score of 1 for this sentence. It does not contain any errors related to syntax, semantics, or morphology, so there is no need to provide further explanation.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Henry found that Bill is sad" is grammatically correct. In terms of syntax, it follows the rules for forming a sentence in English. It has a subject ("Henry"), a verb ("found") and an object ("that Bill is sad"). The tense is consistent throughout (past tense), and there are no missing or extra words. Therefore, I would rate this sentence as syntactically correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence "John considers himself proud of Mary" contains a syntax error known as a misplaced reflexive pronoun. In this case, "himself" is incorrect because it suggests that John is considering his own pride rather than having pride in Mary. A correct version would be "John considers **him** proud of Mary", or alternatively, "John is proud of Mary".
0	Syntax	The correct form of this sentence would be "You should sit there before me." or "You should sit there first.", because the word "before" requires a specific time reference or a comparison between two things. In this case, it seems that the intended meaning was to say that the listener should take a seat before someone else does (i.e., before the speaker). However, without additional context, it's difficult to determine exactly what the corrected sentence should be. Regardless, as written, the sentence contains a syntax error and is therefore incorrect.
1	Syntax	The sentence “There is a nurse available” is grammatically correct. Here’s why: * The subject-auxiliary inversion (“there is”) correctly indicates the existence of something (a nurse). * The verb “is” agrees with its singular subject “nurse.” * The adjective “available” modifies the noun “nurse” appropriately, indicating that the nurse has the property of being ready for use or help. Overall, there are no syntax errors in this sentence.
0	Semantics	The sentence "Everyone hopes everyone to sleep" contains a semantic error. In this context, the verb "hopes" requires an object or a prepositional phrase as its complement. However, there is no explicit direct object or preposition present after "everyone." Instead, we have an infinitive phrase "to sleep," but it does not follow the appropriate structure for such constructions. A more grammatically correct way to express this idea would be "Everyone hopes that everyone else will sleep" or "Everyone wants everyone else to go to sleep."
1	Syntax	The sentence "Everyone hopes that he will sleep" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "Everyone" is a singular pronoun referring to a group of people or things as a whole. It requires a singular verb form such as "hopes." In this case, "everyone" functions as the subject of the sentence. * "Hopes" is a third-person singular present tense verb that agrees with its subject, "everyone." * "That" introduces a subordinate clause, which functions as the direct object of the main clause. * "He" is a third-person singular masculine pronoun used here as a generic pronoun to refer to any person who might be sleeping. While some may argue that using gender-neutral language would be more appropriate in contemporary usage, there is nothing inherently ungrammatical about using gendered pronouns in this way. * "Will sleep" is a future tense construction consisting of the auxiliary verb "will" followed by the base form of the verb "sleep," indicating that someone (in this case, implied through the use of the pronoun "he") intends or plans to sleep.
0	Semantics	The sentence contains a semantic error known as ambiguity. Specifically, it's unclear whether "Churchill" refers to two different people or the same person twice. It could mean that only Winston Churchill himself remembered his own famous speech, but more likely it means that he was the only one who remembered the event clearly. To fix the ambiguity, we can rephrase the sentence by distinguishing between the speaker ("he") and the listener ("the others"): "Only Churchill remembered giving the Blood, Sweat and Tears speech; none of the others did." Alternatively, if both instances refer to Winston Churchill, then we need to clarify that too: "Even though many forgot, Churchill never forgot delivering the Blood, Sweat and Tears speech."
0	Syntax	The error in this sentence is syntactic because it has incorrect word order. In English, reflexive pronouns (e.g., myself, yourself, himself) come after the verb they refer to. Therefore, the correct form should be "John promised Mary to shave himself."
1	Syntax	The sentence "John convinced Bill that Mary should sleep" is grammatically correct. In terms of syntax, it follows the rules for word order and structure in English. The subject of the sentence is "John," followed by the verb "convinced." The indirect object is "Bill," indicated by the preposition "that," and the direct object is "Mary should sleep," indicating what John convinced Bill about. Therefore, there are no syntactic errors in this sentence.
0	Syntax	This sentence contains a syntactic error known as a run-on or fused sentence. It consists of two independent clauses ("I saw Bill" and "you did so Mary") connected only by a conjunction (while). To fix the issue, we can add a semicolon, comma + conjunction, or separate them into two distinct sentences. For example: "I saw Bill; while you did so, Mary." Alternatively, "I saw Bill, and you did so, Mary." Or even simply, "I saw Bill. While you did so, Mary..."
0	Syntax	The verb "give" needs to agree with its subject in number. In this case, the subject "Bill" is singular, so the verb must be "was giving," not "was give." Additionally, there should be a word or phrase (such as "to her") between "Mary" and "did" to show how they're related. A corrected version might read: "What Mary did was give Bill a book" or "What Mary gave to Bill was a book."
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct because it follows standard English syntax rules for a simple sentence. It contains a subject ("the bears") and a verb ("sniffed"), which is all that is necessary for a complete sentence. Additionally, the word "bears" agrees with the plural form of the verb "sniffed."
1	Syntactically Correct	The sentence "to steal talismans from witches is dangerous" follows the rules of English syntax. It contains a subject ("to steal talismans from witches"), a linking verb ("is"), and a predicate adjective ("dangerous"). Although there may be some ambiguity about who or what is being referred to as "dangerous," the sentence does not contain any grammatical errors.
0	Syntax	The sentence "Anson demonized" is syntactically incomplete as it lacks a direct object or an infinitive verb to complete its meaning. A more complete version could be "Anson demonized the proposal," or "Ansor was tasked with demonizing the opposition."
0	Syntax	The verb "kick" requires a singular or plural noun as its subject, but "yourselves" is a reflexive pronoun that refers back to the subject. In this case, the subject "you" is already plural, so using "yourself" would be incorrect because it's singular. Therefore, "yourselves" cannot function as both the object and the subject of the sentence. A correct version could be "You kicked each other."
0	Syntax	This sentence contains a misplaced relative clause. A relative clause modifies a noun, but here it seems to be modifying another relative clause ("that I'd never read") instead of the intended noun ("the book"). To fix this error, we can revise the sentence as follows: "The book that I said I would never read." In this corrected version, the relative clause "that I'd never read" clearly modifies the noun "book," making the syntax clearer and more coherent.
0	Syntax	The verb "demonize" requires a direct object to complete its meaning (e.g., "Anson demonized the evil actions"). In this case, there is no clear direct object for the verb, making the syntax incorrect. Additionally, the word "up" does not add any meaningful contribution to the sentence structure or overall understanding.
1	Semantics	The sentence is grammatically correct, but its meaning is a little unusual because of the negative word "not" being used together with the phrase "might be going." This combination often appears where someone wants to express doubt or uncertainty about something they thought was true before. Here, it seems more natural to say "I might be going to the party," if indeed there's a possibility you will attend; otherwise, consider saying "I am not going to the party" for clarity.
0	Syntax	The sentence "Kick you!" is syntactically incorrect because it lacks a subject. A complete sentence must have both a subject and a predicate (verb). In this case, there is no clear subject indicating who or what is doing the kicking. Additionally, using the imperative form ("kick") would typically be directed towards a second person informally, so adding "you" as the subject may help clarify meaning. However, even if we add "you," the sentence still requires proper punctuation such as a period, question mark, or exclamation point at the end. Therefore, the corrected version could be "Kick you!" or more grammatically correct, "You kick."
1	Syntax	The sentence "Jason persuaded the doctor to treat Medea" is grammatically correct. In terms of syntax, it follows the structure Subject-Verb-Object (SVO), where "Jason" is the subject, "persuaded" is the verb, and "the doctor to treat Medea" is the object. Additionally, the clause "to treat Medea" modifies the verb by specifying what action Jason convinced the doctor to take. Overall, there are no syntactic errors in this sentence.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a misplaced modifier. The phrase "of you" is modifying the verb "get," but it should be modifying the noun "description." A correct version would be: "Who did you get a description of accurately?"
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "The Peter" is a possessive noun phrase referring to a specific person named Peter who is well-liked by everyone. * "we all like" is a verb phrase where "like" functions as the main verb taking the subject "we." * "was" is the linking verb connecting the subject "the Peter" to its predicate nominative "at the party," indicating his presence there. Overall, the syntax follows standard English rules for word order, agreement, and structure.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "the government's imposition," which is a noun phrase functioning as the subject. The verb is "is," which agrees with the singular subject. The object of the preposition "of" is "a fine." Overall, the syntax of the sentence follows standard English rules for word order and structure.
1	Semantics	The sentence "Did Athena help us?" is grammatically correct. It has a question form using the auxiliary verb "did" followed by the subject "Athena" and the main verb "help". From a semantic perspective, it is clear what the speaker is asking - whether or not Athena provided assistance to them. Therefore, there are no errors in syntax, morphology, or semantics.
1	Syntax	The sentence "You wanted to meet the man I saw" is grammatically correct. In terms of syntax, it has a clear subject ("you"), auxiliary verb ("wanted"), main verb ("meet"), object ("the man"), and relative clause ("I saw"). All parts of speech agree with each other in number and tense, making for a coherent sentence structure.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Anson demonized David every day" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Anson," the verb is "demonized," and the direct object is "David." The word "every" functions as a determiner for "day," indicating that the action occurred daily. No grammatical rules have been violated; hence, it's syntactically correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a missing article before the word "programme." A more grammatically correct version would be "There is a *radio program* about Euripides on Radio 4 tonight" or "There is a *programme about Euripides on Radio 4* tonight". Additionally, it's generally preferred to spell out numbers when they begin a sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Medea denied poisoning the phoenix" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a simple sentence, consisting of a subject ("Medea"), a verb ("denied") and an object ("poisoning the phoenix"). Additionally, there are no errors in morphological agreement between words or any other semantic issues that would make the sentence incorrect.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct. It follows standard English syntax rules for word order and structure. The subject ("the elixir") comes before the verb ("was"), and the object ("a hole in the ground") comes after the verb. Additionally, each clause contains a subject and a predicate, making it complete and clear.
0	Syntax	The sentence "Extremely frantically, Anson danced at Trade" contains a syntactic error because it lacks clarity about what or where "Trade" refers to. It could be a proper noun referring to some location (e.g., "Anson danced at Trade Center"), but as written, its meaning is unclear without additional context. Additionally, there's no article before "Trade," making it sound awkward even if used as a place name.
0	Syntax	This sentence has multiple syntax errors. The first error is that there is no main verb in the sentence. A sentence must have a main verb, but here we only see auxiliary verbs ("did" and "who"). The second error is related to the word order. In general, subject-auxiliary verb-object (SAVO) is the standard word order for questions in English, but here it seems that the speaker wants to form a complex question by combining two simple questions, resulting in incorrect word order. To make it clearer, let's break down the intended meaning into simpler questions: * Who did Medea give something to? * What did Medea give to someone? Therefore, the corrected versions could be either: * Who did Medea give something to? * What did Medea give to whom?
1	Syntax	The sentence "It's Anson that I like" is grammatically correct. In this sentence, "it" is a dummy subject used for emphasis or to express existence. "Anson" is the subject complement, which provides more information about the subject "it." "That I like" is a relative clause modifying the subject complement "Anson," indicating who it is that the speaker likes. Overall, the syntax of the sentence is well-formed and unambiguous, making it a grammatically correct sentence.
0	Syntax	The verb "tried" should be followed by a base form of the verb, so it should be "Medea tried to poison her children." Instead, the sentence incorrectly uses the object form "the nurse," resulting in ungrammatical syntax.
0	Semantics	The sentence contains a semantic error. The verb tense does not agree between the two clauses. "I felt" indicates past tense, while "I know" should be in present tense if it refers to current knowledge. A corrected version could be "I feel like I knew you," indicating previous acquaintance, or "I think I know you," indicating present recognition.
0	Syntax	In standard English, we cannot use both "will" and "can" to express future tense together in the same verb phrase. We must choose one or the other. Therefore, the correct version would be either "He will do it" or "He can do it," but not "he will can do it." This error is a syntactic issue because it concerns the arrangement of words and phrases within a sentence.
0	Syntax	The sentence "I ate that she was happy" is syntactically incorrect because it contains a misplaced relative clause. A correct version of the sentence could be "I knew that she was happy." In the original sentence, "that she was happy" cannot correctly modify or describe the subject "I," so the syntax is broken.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Anson believed himself to be handsome" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "Anson" is a proper noun and serves as the subject of the sentence. * "believed" is the past tense of the verb "to believe," indicating that the action occurred in the past. It agrees with the singular subject "Anson." * "himself" functions as the reflexive pronoun for the subject "Anson," indicating that he is performing the action on himself. * "to be" is an infinitive form of the verb "to be," used here to express a state or condition rather than an action. * "handsome" is an adjective describing the state or condition of the subject "Anson." Overall, the syntax of this sentence is correct because it follows standard English grammar rules, including word order, agreement between subject and verb, and use of appropriate forms of verbs and modifiers.
1	Syntax	The sentence "We arrived about six o'clock" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "We" is a pronoun used as the subject of the sentence. * "arrived" is the past tense of the verb "to arrive," indicating what the subject did. * "about" indicates approximation or closeness in time or space. It modifies the prepositional phrase "six o'clock." * "six o'clock" is a noun phrase functioning as the object of the preposition "about." It consists of the numeral "six" and the noun "o'clock." Since it refers to a specific time, we can assume that there is an implied context where this time makes sense (e.g., the evening). Overall, the syntax of the sentence follows standard English rules.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a past perfect verb tense error. The word "has" indicates present perfect tense but it is followed by the past participle form "fought," instead of the past simple form "fought." It should be either "Gilgamesh has fought the dragon" (present perfect) or "Gilgamesh had fought the dragon" (past perfect).
0	Syntax	The reflexive pronoun "himself" cannot be used as a subject complement following a linking verb such as "thought." Instead, a regular personal pronoun or noun must be used. A grammatically correct version would be "Anson thought that he was happy."
1	Semantics	The sentence "Fortunately Hermione passed biology" is grammatically correct, so I will return a 1 for the label. In terms of category, there does not appear to be any issues with syntax (word order), morphology (structure of words), or other common grammatical errors. Therefore, I would place this under semantics, as it relates to the meaning of the sentence being conveyed accurately. In this case, the sentence means that Hermione was fortunate to pass her biology class, and all of the words and their meanings contribute to this overall understanding.
1	Semantics	The sentence "I might be not going to the party but washing my hair" is grammatically correct, although it can be restructured for better clarity. However, there's no semantic error; all parts of the sentence make sense. It conveys the idea that the speaker may choose not to attend a party and instead wash their hair.
0	Syntax	The reflexive pronoun used here (myself) does not agree with the subject (I). In standard English, we use object forms after verbs, so the objective form of the first person singular pronoun (me) would be appropriate here: "He likes me." Alternatively, if you wanted to emphasize the speaker, you could say "he himself likes me," or even better, "I know he likes me."
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct because it follows standard English syntax rules for word order (subject-verb-object). In this case, the subject ("the butler") precedes the verb ("sent"), followed by the object ("the poison"). Additionally, the prepositional phrase "to Dinah" provides further context about who received the action described by the verb. Overall, there are no errors in morphological agreement or semantic meaning within this sentence.
0	Semantics	The sentence contains redundancy because it uses multiple expressions (happens to appear, seems to be) to convey the same meaning, leading to a lack of clarity about whether the person referred to as Jason is actually ill or just giving such an impression. This issue falls under semantic ambiguity where the intended message becomes unclear due to repetitive expression.
0	Semantics	The sentence "What did you ask who saw?" is semantically incorrect because it lacks a clear subject and object. In order for the sentence to be grammatically correct, there needs to be a noun or pronoun that acts as the direct object (the thing being asked) and another noun or pronoun that acts as the subject of the embedded question (who saw). A possible correction could be "Who did you ask what they saw?"
1	Syntax	The sentence "We linguists love to argue" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "We" serves as the subject of the sentence. It is a personal pronoun in the nominative case, indicating that it performs the action of the verb. * "linguists" is a plural noun referring to people who specialize in linguistics. In this context, "we" refers to the speaker and other unspecified individuals who share their profession. * "love" is a present tense verb in the indicative mood, expressing a feeling or emotion. As a transitive verb, it requires a direct object. * "to argue" functions as the infinitive phrase serving as the direct object of the verb "love". An infinitive consists of "to + base form" of the verb (in this case, "argue"). This construction indicates what is being loved by the subject ("we") - namely, arguing. Overall, the syntax of the sentence follows standard English rules for word order and structure.
0	Syntax	The sentence "He can will go" is grammatically incorrect because it contains a redundancy error. The modal verb "can" already implies ability or possibility, so using another modal verb such as "will" (which expresses future tense) after it creates confusion and is unnecessary. A correct version could be "He can go" if the meaning is about his ability to do something, or simply "He will go" if the intended meaning refers to a certain action he will take in the future.
0	Syntax	The sentence "How fierce the battle?" is grammatically incorrect because it lacks a proper question word or auxiliary verb to form a complete question. A correct version could be "How fierce was the battle?" or "How fierce is the battle?" depending on the intended meaning.
0	Syntax	The question contains a syntactic ambiguity due to the misplaced relative clause "which city invaded." It's unclear whether it modifies "king" or "city," leading to confusion about what information the speaker seeks. To clarify, consider rephrasing as follows: a) "Which king did you ask about the city that was invaded?" (seeking info on 'king') b) "Did you ask which city a certain king had invaded?" (seeking info on 'city')
0	Syntax	The phrase "some disgruntled old pigs" contains a plural subject ("pigs") but the verb "is" that follows it is singular, creating a mismatch between the subject and verb agreement rule in English. This error can be corrected by changing the verb to its plural form, e.g., "are". Additionally, the possessive pronoun "those" before "ditches" is unnecessary since no specific ditches have been previously mentioned or identified, making it unclear what exactly "those" refers to.
0	Syntax	In the sentence "That banana is eating the monkey," there is a syntactic error where the subject-verb agreement has been violated. The subject "that banana" is singular but the verb "is eating" suggests a plural subject, resulting in incorrect syntax. A correct version could be "That monkey is eating the banana."
0	Syntax	The sentence "Burn them!" is a fragment because it lacks a main verb and a subject. A complete sentence requires both components. For example, a corrected version could be "Burn them carefully." or "He will burn them.", depending on the intended meaning.
1	Semantics	The sentence "It stinks that Aphrodite is omnipotent" is grammatically correct. Here, the word "stinks" is used metaphorically to express dissatisfaction or disapproval towards the fact that Aphrodite (a Greek goddess) possesses unlimited power (omnipotence). Although it might seem unusual for some people to use such a term, its usage here does not violate any grammatical rules. Therefore, I would classify this as a semantic issue instead of syntax, morphology, or other linguistic errors.
1	Semantics	The sentence "Agamemnon seems to be a maniac" is grammatically correct. In terms of semantics, it can be interpreted in different ways depending on the context. It could mean that Agamemnon exhibits symptoms or behaviors associated with being a maniac (in a psychological sense), or it could simply be used as a strong criticism of his actions or personality. Either way, there is no clear syntactic, morphological, or other error in the sentence.
1	Other Category	The sentence “Will Anson come to the party?” is grammatically correct. It contains a subject (“Anson”), an auxiliary verb (“will”) that indicates future tense, and a main verb (“come”). Additionally, it includes a prepositional phrase (“to the party”) that functions as the destination for the action described by the main verb. Overall, there are no syntactic, semantic, or morphological errors in this sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence "I wondered who Medea had poisoned" is grammatically correct. In this sentence, the subject is "I", the verb is "wondered", and the object clause starts with "who". This clause functions as the direct object of the main clause, headed by the verb "wondered." The past perfect tense ("had poisoned") correctly indicates that the action took place before another past time reference (e.g., when the speaker started wondering). Therefore, there is no mistake regarding syntax, morphology, or semantics in this sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence "I inquired when could we leave" is grammatically correct, but it contains a minor stylistic issue related to word order. In formal written English, it would be more common to phrase the question as follows: "I inquired when we could leave." This revised version preserves the original meaning while adhering to conventional syntax rules for interrogative clauses in standard English. Nonetheless, since the provided sentence does not contain any grammatical errors or incorrect usage, it can still be considered syntactically acceptable.
0	Syntax	The sentence "They kicked them" is grammatically incomplete because it lacks a clear antecedent for the pronoun "them." It's unclear who or what was being kicked, so additional context is needed to make the sentence complete and understandable.
0	Syntax	In the present tense, we use "eats" for third-person singular subjects (he, she, it). Therefore, the correct form of the verb in this sentence should be "eats," making it read as follows: "The monkey eats the banana."
0	Syntax	The correct form of the verb to be for the subject "I" is "could." However, there is a mistake in the structure of the sentence. It should be "I would like to be able to swim," or simply "I'd like to swim." In its current form, it appears that "swim" is being used as a noun instead of a verb, but since it follows "to," we expect it to function as a verb. Therefore, the original sentence is grammatically incorrect due to a syntax error.
1	Syntax	The sentence "I kicked myself" is grammatically correct because it follows standard English syntax rules for subject-verb-object word order. The subject "I" is performing the action indicated by the verb "kicked," and the object "myself" receives the action. Additionally, the verb form "kicked" agrees with the singular subject "I." Therefore, no corrections need to be made to this sentence based on syntactic grounds.
0	Syntax	In the sentence "The bookcase ran," the word "ran" is being used as a verb indicating action or movement. However, it's not appropriate to use this verb with a bookcase because bookcases do not have the ability to move on their own. Therefore, the syntax of this sentence is incorrect due to the improper usage of the verb "ran." A more appropriate way to phrase this would be "The bookcase fell over" if the intention was to convey some sort of motion related to the bookcase.
1	Syntax	The sentence "I shaved myself" is grammatically correct. In this sentence, the subject is "I", the verb is "shaved", and the object is "myself". This follows the standard structure for a simple sentence in English (Subject-Verb-Object). Additionally, the word "shaved" agrees with the subject "I" in number as both are singular. Furthermore, the reflexive pronoun "myself" correctly refers back to the subject "I" and indicates that the action was performed by the same entity that it affected.
0	Morphology	The phrase "muscle bound" is actually an adjective describing someone who has large muscles but is not very flexible. However, it needs to be used as an adjective before a noun (e.g., "Anson became a muscle-bound man.") or after a linking verb such as "is" or "was." In this case, since there's no noun following "a," we need to add a hyphen between "muscle" and "bound" to make them function together as an adjective. Additionally, if "muscle-bound" describes Anson directly, then consider revising the sentence to include a linking verb, e.g., "Anson became muscle-bound" or "Anson was muscle-bound."
