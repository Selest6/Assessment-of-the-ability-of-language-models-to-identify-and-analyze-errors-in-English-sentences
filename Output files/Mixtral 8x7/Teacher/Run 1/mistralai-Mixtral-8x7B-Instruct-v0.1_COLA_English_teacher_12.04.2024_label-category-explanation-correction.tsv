1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically correct as it follows the rules for word order and structure in English. The subject ("the sailors") comes before the verb ("rode"), and the object ("the breeze") comes between the verb and its prepositional phrase modifier ("clear of the rocks").	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "The weights made the rope stretch over the pulley" is grammatically correct. It follows standard English syntax rules for word order and structure.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is structurally correct and follows the rules of English syntax. The subject ("the mechanical doll") is followed by a verb ("wriggled") and the reflexive pronoun ("itself") correctly refers back to the subject. Additionally, the past tense verb form ("wriggled") indicates completed action in the past, consistent with the intended meaning.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Semantics	The sentence is semantically correct because it follows the conditional structure correctly. It implies a hypothetical situation where if the subject had consumed more food, they would desire less as a result of feeling full.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Semantics	The sentence contains a logical error. It suggests that the more someone eats, the less they desire. This is illogical because wanting something usually increases as need for it rises. A corrected version could be: "As you eat the most, you seem to want the least," acknowledging observation rather than causality.	The sentence should either acknowledge observation ("As you eat the most, you seem to want the least") or present a clear cause-effect relationship between variables if data supports such a claim.
0	Syntax	This sentence contains a syntactic error known as a double negative. Specifically, it uses both the word "more" and the negation "wouldn't" ("would not") in close proximity, creating ambiguity about whether the speaker intends a positive or negative meaning. To make the sentence grammatically correct while preserving its intended meaning, we could say either "The less you would eat, the more you would want," or simply "The more you want, the less you will eat."	The less you would eat, the more you would want.
0	Syntax	The error in this sentence is a subject-verb agreement problem. In the first clause ("the more John eat"), "eat" should be "eats" because its subject "John" is singular.	The sentence should read as follows: "The more John eats, the more he pays."
0	Syntax	The issue with this sentence lies in subject-verb agreement. In the conjunction "she gets," "gets" does not agree in number with its subject "Mary." It should be changed to match the singular third person present tense form of the verb "listen," which is "listens."	Mary listens to the Grateful Dead; she gets depressed. OR Mary listens to the Grateful Dead and gets depressed.
1	Syntax	This sentence is syntactically correct because it follows the rules for word order and structure in English. The first clause, "the angrier Mary got," is a comparative statement using the past tense verb "got" and the adjective "angrier". It modifies the subject "Mary", who is being compared to herself in a previous state. The second clause, "the more she looked at pictures," uses the comparative construction "the more...the more" to show cause and effect between two actions. Both clauses use parallel structures, making the relationship between them clear.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct and its syntax follows standard English rules for word order and structure. It uses a common construction where the comparative adverb ("the higher") modifies the subject ("the stakes"), followed by an adjective clause that describes the subject's effect on something else ("his expectations").	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct and follows the rules for syntax in English. The subject ("the more Fred is obnoxious") and predicate ("the less attention you should pay to him") are both present and accounted for, and they agree in number. Additionally, the word order is correct, with the subject coming before the predicate.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "John was lots more obnoxious than Fred" is grammatically correct. Although some people might prefer using "a lot" instead of "lots," both forms are widely used and accepted in informal English.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically correct because it follows the rules for forming a grammatical sentence in English. It has a subject ("the more people"), a verb ("get"), and an object ("sick"). Additionally, the word order is correct, and there are no missing or extra words.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	This sentence contains a common error known as a "mixed construction," where two clauses are combined using the wrong form of a word or words. In this case, "the more" is used in both clauses, but it's only correct to use it once. A better way to express this idea would be to say "The more Bill smokes, the more Susan hates that he does so."	The more Bill smokes, the more Susan hates that he does so.
1	Syntax	The sentence provided is grammatically correct and well-structured. It follows a clear subject-verb-object pattern in both clauses ("the more embarrassed John becomes" and "pictures of him...appear"). Additionally, there is appropriate use of punctuation and word choice.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically correct. It follows the standard structure of subject-verb-object and has a clear meaning. The use of verb tenses is consistent throughout the sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a syntax error because the clause "he likes" lacks a direct object. A complete sentence requires both a subject ("he") and a predicate ("likes"). However, without a direct object following the verb "likes," the predicate remains incomplete. As a result, the intended meaning of the sentence cannot be accurately understood.	Who does John visit Sally because he likes her?
1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically correct because it follows the rules for word order and structure in English. Specifically, the subject ("Marianne") comes before the verb ("did not leave"), and the negative auxiliary verb ("did not") is used correctly to negate the main verb ("leave").	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "He could not have been working" is grammatically correct. It follows standard English syntax rules for verb tense agreement and word order. Here's a breakdown: * "he" is the subject pronoun * "could not have been" is the auxiliary verb phrase expressing past ability negated by "not," followed by present perfect continuous aspect expressed by "have been" * "working" is the main verb in gerund form, indicating ongoing action in the past Therefore, there are no syntactic errors in this sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a double negative ("can not" and "never"), which creates confusion and makes it unclear what the intended meaning is. In English, we generally avoid using multiple negatives in the same clause because they can create ambiguity. A better way to express the idea would be to use only one negative, as in "He couldn't have been working" or "He can never have been working," depending on the intended meaning.	He couldn't have been working.
1	Other Category	The sentence is grammatically correct but it may be missing some context for me to fully determine its meaning. For example, believing someone can mean trusting them or accepting what they say as true, so more context would help clarify the intended meaning. However, based on grammar alone, there are no errors in this sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically correct as it follows the standard structure of Subject-Verb-Object (SVO), where "John" is the subject, "has not kissed" is the verb phrase, and "Mary" is the object.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is correctly written in terms of syntax as it follows the rules for word order and structure in English. It uses an embedded clause ("that never in my life had I seen") to provide additional information about the subject ("I"). This type of construction is common in complex sentences and adds emphasis to the statement being made.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The error in this sentence is a violation of syntactic rules because the pronoun "it" has been incorrectly placed after the verb "looked up". In English, we typically say "look something up", where "something" is the object being searched for. Therefore, the correct phrasing would be "Mickey looked it up."	Mickey looked it up.
0	Syntax	The subject-verb agreement rule states that when using a singular subject, we must use a singular verb, and when using a plural subject, we must use a plural verb. In this case, "there" is serving as a singular subject, but "tended" does not agree with it because "tended" is the past tense form of "to tend," which can only be used as a helping verb. To fix this error, replace "tended" with another appropriate singular verb such as "was" or "occurred."	There occurred to be a lot of discussion. OR There was a lot of discussion.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct, as it follows standard subject-verb-object word order and proper use of tenses.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Other Category	The sentence "John is eager" is grammatically correct as it follows the standard structure of a simple present tense sentence in English (Subject + Verb + Object), where the subject "John" is followed by the verb "is" and the adjective "eager". In this case, there is no object since "eager" describes the state of "John".	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "We want John to win" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "we," the verb is "want," and the infinitive phrase "to win" functions as the direct object.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically well-formed as it follows the standard structure of a simple sentence - Subject ("the box") + Verb ("contained") + Object ("the ball"). Moreover, all elements within the sentence agree in number and tense.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	In English, we do not say "the tube was escaped by gas," but rather "gas escaped from the tube" because the action is performed by the subject ("gas") on the object ("tube"). This type of construction is called a passive voice, where the patient (object) becomes the subject of the sentence, while the agent (subject) can be omitted if it's unimportant for the context.	Gas escaped from the tube.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Water bubbled up out of the kettle" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of English syntax. In this sentence, the subject ("water") comes before the verb ("bubbled"), and the object ("the kettle") comes after the verb. This is a common word order in English, known as Subject-Verb-Object (SVO), and it allows for clear communication of meaning.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "The tub leaked water" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "the tub," and the verb is "leaked." The object of the verb is "water." This structure follows standard English syntax rules for simple sentences.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Semantics	The sentence contains a semantic error because the verb "fill" requires an object to be affected by the action, but in this case, there's no explicit mention of what gets filled. A more appropriate way to express the intended meaning would be "What the water did to the bottle was fill it up".	What the water did to the bottle was fill it up.
0	Semantics	The sentence contains a semantic error because the verb 'fill' requires an object to be complete. In this case, 'it' refers back to 'the bottle', but before we can say that something has filled a container, there needs to be some indication that the container was empty. We cannot simply state that filling happened without specifying what was filled first. Therefore, the intended meaning behind the original sentence would require additional context or modification to convey the idea accurately.	The sentence is almost correct; however, for better clarity, consider revising as follows: "What had happened to the entire bottle was that it got filled by the water."
0	Syntax	In the sentence "The tank leaked the fluid free," there is a mistake in subject-verb agreement. The plural noun "fluid" requires a plural verb form such as "leak." However, the singular verb form "leaked" is used instead. This error violates the syntactic rule for subject-verb agreement, making the sentence ungrammatical.	The tank leaked the fluids freely.
1	Syntax	The sentence "John lay the ball in the box" is grammatically correct, but its tense is inconsistent. "Lay" requires a past participle ("laid") when used in the passive voice, as it seems to be here. A more consistent version would be "John laid the ball in the box". However, because the question asks for only a binary response regarding grammaticality, I will still mark this as correct since there's no major error hindering comprehension.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "John owns the book" is grammatically correct. It follows standard subject-verb-object word order in English.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct because it uses two infinitive phrases ("to leave" and "to stay") as the direct objects of the verb "persuaded". Each infinitive phrase has its own subject ("Mary" and "Sue"), making the sentence clear and easy to understand.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The clause "even though the courts didn't actually find, Klaus guilty of murder" contains a comma splice error. A conjunction such as "but" or "although" is needed to connect the two clauses properly.	Most people probably consider, even though the courts didn't actually find him guilty of murder, Klaus to be guilty of murder.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Mary beautifully plays the violin" is grammatically correct. The subject "Mary" is correctly modified by the adverb "beautifully," and the verb "plays" agrees in number with the subject. Additionally, the object of the preposition "the" modifies the noun "violin" appropriately.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Semantics	The sentence is grammatically correct but semantically incorrect because it's unlikely for someone to learn a new language perfectly right away. Additionally, the use of "probably" suggests uncertainty about whether John will learn French, making it contradictory to say he will do so perfectly.	The sentence is already correct if we assume there is some context where learning a language perfectly immediately is plausible. However, I would suggest revising it to something like "Clearly, John will soon master French," since perfect fluency usually takes time.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains an error in its syntax because it uses two prepositions ("to" and "a") back-to-back before the object "Bill". In English grammar, we typically use only one preposition before an article (such as "the", "a", or "an"). To fix this issue, we can remove the second preposition and rephrase the sentence as follows: "Sue gave Bill a book."	Sue gave Bill a book.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct because it follows standard subject-verb agreement rules. "Men" is a plural noun, so the verb must be in its plural form as well; here, "will leave" is used instead of the singular "leaves," making the sentence syntactically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "John went home" is grammatically correct because it follows standard English syntax rules for word order in a simple sentence. In this case, the subject ("John") comes before the verb ("went"), and the object ("home") correctly follows the verb.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a misplaced modifier error. In the original sentence, it sounds like they represented Dean Mary as a serious linguist because of how seriously they took her. To fix the issue, we need to move "seriously" next to "represented", so that it's clear who was being serious during the representation.	They represented Mary, the dean, as a genuine linguist seriously.
0	Syntax	The order of subjects and verbs is incorrect in this sentence. In English, the subject typically comes before the verb. Additionally, there is no possessive form used for the pronoun "us" in this context. A correct version could be "They love us."	They love us.
1	Syntax	The sentence "It is nice to go abroad" is grammatically correct. The subject pronoun "it" is used correctly as a placeholder for the abstract concept being discussed ("niceness"). The verb form "is" agrees with its singular subject "it". Finally, the infinitive phrase "to go abroad" functions appropriately as the direct object of the linking verb "is", indicating what it is that is nice.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically correct because it follows the rules for word order and structure in English. It contains a subject ("Mary"), an auxiliary verb ("intended"), an object ("John"), and a verbal phrase ("to go abroad"). All elements are grammatically connected and form a coherent meaning.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Semantics	The sentence "I remembered having kissed Mary" is grammatically and morphologically correct. However, it contains a semantic ambiguity because it can be interpreted in two ways depending on whether the action of kissing occurred before or after remembering it. To clarify the intended meaning, the sentence could be rephrased as "I remember having kissed Mary" (indicating that the speaker remembers a past event of kissing Mary) or "Having kissed Mary, I remembered her name" (indicating that the act of kissing triggered the memory of her name). Since there is no way to determine the intended meaning based solely on grammar and syntax, we will assume that the sentence is acceptable but potentially ambiguous.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The coordinating conjunction 'either' needs to connect two equal elements. Here it seems there is a missing element before 'either'. A possible correction would be: "I can't believe Fred won't, and neither will I."	I can't believe Fred won't, and neither will I.
0	Syntax	The second instance of "want" in the sentence needs a pronoun before it for proper subject-verb agreement. Without it, the verb appears as if it does not have a clear subject, leading to unclear syntax.	John wants to read Fred's story, and I also want to read it.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a syntactic error related to the agreement between subject and verb. In particular, the plural form "to" does not agree with its singular subject "who". To fix this issue, it would be better to say "but we couldn't decide whom to invite."	The corrected sentence is: "We wanted to invite someone, but we couldn't decide whom to invite."
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct. It consists of two independent clauses connected by a coordinating conjunction ("and"). Each clause has a subject ("Mary"/"Joe") and a verb ("will read"), and each clause modifies the noun phrases after it using possessive forms ("Fred's story"/"Holly's").	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a coordination error. It appears that two separate clauses have been conjoined without using appropriate conjunction words such as 'and', 'or', etc. Also, it seems unclear who 'shouldn't' be doing something; if it refers to Holly, then we need a subject-verb agreement between 'Holly' and 'shouldn't'. A corrected version could read: "Mary claimed that while she was eating cabbage, Holly shouldn't." OR "Mary claimed that eating cabbage herself meant that Holly shouldn't."	Mary claimed that while she was eating cabbage, Holly shouldn't.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a subject-verb agreement error. In the second clause ("I also came to be"), the plural form "came" does not agree with its singular subject "I". It should instead read "I also was."	Mary came to be introduced by the bartender and I also was.
1	Acceptable Use / Pragmatics	The sentence "If I can, I will work on it" contains a common construction used to express tentativeness about one's ability or willingness to do something. While some people might prefer a more definitive statement such as "I will work on it," there is nothing inherently incorrect about the original sentence from either a syntactic, semantic, or morphological perspective.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in the second clause ("Sally does too"). It should be "Sally do too" since the plural noun "neuroses" triggers a plural verb. However, it would sound more natural to say "so does Sally," maintaining the singular form for consistency with the first clause.	Either "Joe's neuroses bother his patrons, and Sally does too." can be revised as "Joe's neuroses bother his patrons, and Sally's bothers them too." Or alternatively, "Joe's neuroses bother his patrons, and so does Sally."
0	Semantics	The issue here lies in the semantic interpretation of the sentence. Specifically, there is ambiguity regarding who "it" refers to in the second clause - does "it" refer to the same book that José didn't read, or a different book? This makes the intended meaning unclear. A better way to express this idea would be: "I know which book José didn’t read for class and which book Lilly read instead."	I know which book José didn’t read for class and which book Lilly read instead.
0	Syntax	The second clause "and this is the one which Fred won't do it" contains a pronoun-verb agreement error. It should be "and this is the one which Fred won't do".	This is the book which Bob reviewed, and this is the one which Fred won't do.
0	Syntax	The subject-auxiliary inversion doesn't occur correctly in the second clause "which book Bob said that you hadn't". It should be "which book Bob had said that you hadn't read" for grammatical correctness.	I know which book Mag read, and which book Bob had said that you hadn't read.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a syntactic error where there is no clear subject-verb agreement. Specifically, "my report that you hadn't" does not have a clear antecedent, making it unclear what has been read by the speaker. Additionally, "hadn't" seems unnecessary in this context. A possible correction could be: "I know which book Mag read, and which book Bob read before me."	I know which book Mag read, and which book Bob read before me.
1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically correct as it follows the rules for word order and structure in English. It contains a subject ("I"), a verb ("would like"), and two objects ("him" and "fruit more than I would cookies"). The comparison between "fruit" and "cookies" is clear due to the use of "more than".	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a redundancy error due to the repetition of the verb "talked" in both clauses. It would be grammatically correct to say either "Rusty talked about himself only after Mary did," or "Rusty talked about himself only after Mary had."	Rusty talked about himself only after Mary did. OR Rusty talked about himself only after Mary had.
0	Syntax	The repetition of the word 'talk' causes a redundancy issue in this sentence. A more appropriate way to structure it would be as follows: "Fred talked about everything before Rusty did so about something else." This resolves the repetitive syntax while maintaining the intended meaning.	Fred talked about everything before Rusty did so about something else.
1	Syntax	The sentence "John often meets Mary" is grammatically correct. It follows the standard Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) word order in English. The subject "John" is followed by the verb "meets", and the object "Mary".	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	In this case, the subject ("the problem") does not clearly agree with the verb ("perceives"). A more appropriate verb would be "seems" or "is perceived," as they both match the singular form of "problem". Also, there seems to be a missing determiner before "easily", making it sound unnatural and incorrect.	The sentence should read either "The problem seems easy" or "The problem is perceived easily."
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct and the meaning is clear. The quantifier "a hundred" modifies the noun "men," indicating how many men there are. This forms a noun phrase, which functions as the subject of the sentence. The verb "surrounded" agrees with the plural subject in number. The prepositional phrase "the fort" functions as the object of the verb, specifying what the men surrounded.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	In English, we generally do not use the first person pronoun ("me," "I") as the object of election verbs. Instead, we typically say something like "They elected him" or "We elected her." The sentence "We elected me" is grammatically incorrect because it violates this usage rule.	They elected me.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a misplaced relative pronoun. In the original sentence, it sounds as if we're looking for a specific report about John being incompetent among many reports that he might have submitted. However, based on context, I believe what you want to ask is: "Which report, indicating that John was incompetent, did he submit?"	Which report, indicating that John was incompetent, did he submit?
1	Syntax	The sentence is correctly structured according to the rules of English syntax. It contains a subject ("Mary"), a finite verb ("has preferred"), and two objects ("lemons" and "limes"). The word order follows the standard Subject-Verb-Object pattern, and there are no grammatical errors such as missing punctuation marks, incorrect tense usage, or misplaced modifiers.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The issue with this sentence lies in its syntax, specifically the lack of a main verb for the clause "which were whining out". A relative pronoun such as "which" needs to be followed by a verb to form a proper relative clause. In this case, it would make more sense to say "He let the cats that were whining out" or "He let the cats while they were whining out", where there is a clear main verb for each clause.	He let the cats that were whining out.
0	Other Category	The sentence is missing necessary context to be evaluated for grammaticality. It would need more information about who "Bill" is and what action he took regarding a purchase. For example, "What did Bill buy for his sister?" or "What kind of car did Bill buy?"	Without additional context, it's impossible to provide a corrected version of the original sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence is correctly constructed according to the rules of syntax in English. The subject ("Mary") comes before the verb ("saw"), and the object ("the boy") comes between the verb and its modifier ("walking"). The prepositional phrase ("toward the railroad station") follows logically from the action described by the verb.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a subject-verb agreement error and a verb tense inconsistency. Specifically, "giver" should be "given," and "had lied" should agree in past tense with "was." Additionally, there is missing punctuation between the two clauses.	A proof that the claim had been made was given because John had lied.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains multiple issues related to syntactic structure and word choice that make it difficult to understand. Specifically, there are several prepositional phrases ("to a short circuit," "which was caused by an overloaded transducer," "which destroyed most of my factory") modifying various parts of the sentence without clear connections between them. Additionally, attributing something "to" another thing typically implies that the first thing originated from the second thing, but here it seems as though the short circuit caused the fire rather than being attributed to it.	The fire that destroyed most of my factory was caused by an overloaded transducer resulting in a short circuit.
0	Syntax	The issue with this sentence lies in its syntax, specifically regarding verb tense agreement. The verb "regarded" is in the past tense while the present participle "being" creates a mismatch, making the sentence grammatically incorrect. A corrected version would use either two verbs in the past tense ("regarded as absurd") or two in the present tense ("considers as absurd"). Additionally, there's no need for a relative pronoun such as "the" before "proposal".	The mayor regards as absurd the proposal to build a sidewalk from Dartmouth to Smith. Alternatively: The mayor regarded as absurd the proposal to build a sidewalk from Dartmouth to Smith.
1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically correct because it follows the rules for word order and structure in English. However, there is some ambiguity as to whether "to remain a secret" applies to Bill leaving or just remaining a secret himself. This could be clarified by rephrasing the sentence slightly.	I want Bill's departure to remain a secret.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a syntactic error where two instances of the verb "drives" are used consecutively, causing redundancy and incorrect syntax. The second instance of "drives" should be replaced with another appropriate form of the verb or pronoun to create a grammatically correct sentence.	"I know a man whom Tom drives," or "I know a man who Tom transports."
0	Syntax	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect. "Cats" is a plural noun, so it requires a plural verb. However, "is" is singular. It should be changed to "are". Additionally, "drowning" is a present participle used as an adjective to describe the state of the cats rather than what they are doing; hence, no change needs to be made here.	Drowning cats, which is against the law, are hard to rescue. The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Muriel said nothing else than that she had been insulted" is grammatically correct. It uses a correlative conjunction ("not only...but also") in a cleft sentence structure to emphasize what Muriel did say, as opposed to anything else she could have said. This type of construction can be seen as more formal or complex, but it is still grammatically valid.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The subject ("Himself") and verb ("is understood") do not agree in number. In this case, "Himself" is a reflexive pronoun referring to a singular noun, so the verb must be singular as well. However, "are understood" would be the grammatically correct form for the plural subject "Rutherford". To make the sentence grammatically correct while keeping both subjects, we could say "Rutherford understands himself."	The sentence "Rutherford understands himself" is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct but can be improved for clarity by adding a determiner before the proper noun "Arch". A more clear version would be "I feel that **the** Arch will show up.", assuming there's context where "Arch" refers to something specific known to both the speaker and listener. However, if "Arch" is used as a name, then no article is needed. In general, including articles when referring to names depends on personal preference or cultural norms.	The sentence is already mostly correct; it only requires minor clarification based on context.
0	Syntax	In this sentence, there is a lack of subject-verb agreement. The verb "is" does not agree with its plural subject "proof". It should be changed to "are" for the sentence to be grammatically correct.	The proofs for this set being recursive are difficult.
0	Syntax	This sentence contains a syntactic error known as a misplaced modifier. In this case, the restrictive relative clause "which Henry plays the lute and sings" incorrectly modifies both "madrigals" and "sound," implying that the madrigals themselves play the lute and sing. To fix this error, we need to clarify what is being modified by adding another relative pronoun such as "that": "The madrigals that Henry plays the lute and sings sound lousy." Alternatively, we could rephrase the sentence entirely: "Henry's performance of madrigals on the lute sounds lousy."	The madrigals that Henry plays the lute and sings sound lousy.
1	Syntax	The sentence is a collection of three independent clauses connected by coordinating conjunctions ("and"). Each clause has a subject-verb agreement, and there is no ambiguity in meaning, so it follows syntactic rules correctly.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence is a question but lacks appropriate punctuation. It requires a question mark at the end instead of a period. Also, there should be a comma after "Where" for clarity and proper syntax.	"Where did you go, and who ate what?"
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a misplaced possessive pronoun. Specifically, "Which boy's" does not make sense because it is unclear whose possession is being referred to. Additionally, there is a missing article before "guardian". A more grammatically correct version would be "Of which boy's guardian did we elect the employer as president?"	Of which boy's guardian did we elect the employer as president?
0	Semantics	The word "sane" requires a comparative or degree modifier because it is a subjective attribute. For example, we can say "How sane is Peter compared to his brother?" or "How extremely sane is Peter?". Without such modification, the question lacks context and sounds odd.	The sentence should be modified as follows for better clarity and coherence: "How sane is Peter compared to his brother?" or "How extremely sane is Peter?"
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a minor syntax error. In the second part of the sentence, it should be "the Hudson River" instead of just "Hudson River". This is because when we use definite articles ("the") before specific nouns such as names of rivers, we need to include them even if they've been previously mentioned.	I live at the place where Route 150 crosses the River and my dad lives at the place where Route 150 crosses the Hudson River too.
0	Syntax	The pronoun 'it' in the second clause refers to 'the place', but 'Route 150 crosses the Hudson River' is a description of the location rather than the name of the place itself. Therefore, using 'it' here could lead to confusion. To avoid ambiguity, we can replace 'it' with 'that spot'.	I live at the place where Route 150 crosses the Hudson River and my dad lives at that spot too.
0	Syntax	The correct form of the verb to be after who is she should be "is" instead of "to make". A possible correction could be: "Who is she trying to pretend to now?"	The sentence should be "Who is she trying to pretend to now?"
0	Syntax	The verb "get" should be used as the past participle form "gotten" when it follows another passive verb such as "was". However, there is no preceding passive verb here. It seems that the writer intended to use the simple past tense instead of the past perfect continuous tense. A more appropriate way to express this idea would be "Wind got off a plot to negotiate an honorable end to the war in Vietnam," but this still does not make complete sense semantically. Here's how I suggest rewriting the entire sentence for clarity and grammaticality: "It became known that there had been a plot to prevent negotiations toward an honorable end to the war in Vietnam."	It became known that there had been a plot to prevent negotiations toward an honorable end to the war in Vietnam.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct but it may have a different intended meaning than what was meant by the speaker. In its current form, the sentence implies that Mike talked about politics specifically to the listener's friends, rather than just generally about politics. To make the sentence clearer, we can say "Mike talked about politics yesterday, including to my friends," if the intention is to indicate that he spoke to various people, including the listener's friends, about politics. Alternatively, if the intended meaning is indeed that Mike spoke only to the listener's friends about politics, then the original sentence is fine as-is.	See explanation; either leave the sentence as-is or add "including" for clarity.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct and well-formed. The subject "the reporters" is followed by a verb tense ("was expected") that agrees with it, and there is a clear object complement ("that the principal would fire some teacher").	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The pronoun used in the sentence does not agree with the gender of the name "Mike". In English, the pronoun "she" is typically used for females, while "he" is used for males. Here, the name "Mike" is most commonly associated with a male name, so the appropriate pronoun would be "he", as follows: Which hat did Mike quip that he never wore?	Which hat did Mike quip that he never wore?
0	Syntax	The issue with this sentence lies in its syntax, specifically word order. In this case, the subject ("which girl") has been separated from its verb ("did wear"), making it difficult for the reader to understand who wore the hat. Additionally, there seems to be a negation error where "never" modifies "wore," but what's intended is likely that Mike made some comment about the girl wearing the hat at no time. Here's how we can fix it:	"Which girl, according to Mike, never wore this hat?"
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows standard subject-verb-object word order and contains no syntactical errors such as misplaced modifiers or awkward phrasing.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The negation "won't" requires a base form of the verb after it, but "have" is not the base form here. It should be "I won't have some money." or simply "I don't have some money.", where "don't" contracts with the base form of the verb "have".	I won't have some money.
0	Semantics	The sentence contains a semantic error because it lacks sufficient context to determine its truth value. The words "do you believe" indicate that there may be some doubt about the claim, but no evidence has been provided to either support or refute it. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive response without additional information.	It is unclear whether the claim that someone was looking for something is true or false without further context.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a misplaced modifier error. The clause "that he tried to force me to give her" is incorrectly modifying "any money," implying that the money itself was being forced rather than the act of giving it. To fix this error, the clause should modify "give" instead. A corrected version could be: "I won't let you believe that he tried to force me to give her any."	I won't let you believe that he tried to force me to give her any.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct, but it is syntactically ambiguous because it can be interpreted in two ways: either someone was pleased that Sam did not always sleep, or there was a person who was happy when they thought about the times when Sam did not sleep. This type of ambiguity is called scope ambiguity. However, since the question asks for a binary response indicating whether the sentence is grammatically correct or not, I will mark it as correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The reflexive pronoun "himself" is incorrect in this context because it refers back to the wrong noun, "Winston". To make the sentence grammatically correct, we need to use the objective form of the personal pronoun, which is "he": "I talked to Winston about him."	I talked to Winston about him.
0	Syntax	The first clause "That the fuzz wanted him worried John" contains a subject-verb agreement error. It should be "that the fuzz worried him," as "fuzz" is singular and requires a singular verb form. Additionally, there seems to be confusion about whether "wanted" or "worried" should describe John; I will assume it is supposed to be "that the fuzz worried him" based on the second clause.	The corrected sentence would read: "That the fuzz worried him, but that the fuzz didn't worry her."
0	Syntax	The subject-auxiliary inversion required for questions is missing in this sentence. It should be "Will Sam work on it if..." instead of "Sam will be working on it if...". Also, there is no need for a comma after 'if'.	Will Sam work on it if he does?
0	Syntax	This sentence contains a double negative ("don't" and "no"), which is incorrect in standard English grammar. The correct version would be "She doesn't have any apples."	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a repetition of the preposition "for" which is unnecessary and results in incorrect syntax. A more appropriate way to phrase it would be as follows: "Here's a knife for you to cut up the onions with."	Here's a knife for you to cut up the onions with.
0	Syntax	The coordinating conjunction "which" should be replaced by a subordinating conjunction such as "that". Also, there should be a comma after "sick" because it separates two independent clauses.	Fluffy is sick, which not everyone knows. OR Fluffy is sick, something that not everyone knows.
0	Semantics	The sentence "Maxwell is quite a doctor" is grammatically correct but semantically odd because "quite a doctor" implies that being a doctor is a surprising or remarkable quality for Maxwell, which may not be true. A more appropriate way to express it would be "Maxwell is a very competent doctor" if that's what we mean.	The sentence "Maxwell is quite a doctor" can be revised as "Maxwell is a very competent doctor".
0	Syntax	This sentence contains a repeated word "and" after "tall", which makes it grammatically incorrect. It seems that there is an extra "and" before "blond".	The corrected sentence would be: "The younger woman might have been tall and the older one definitely was blond."
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a syntactic error because there is no comma before the conjunction "and" when connecting two independent clauses. Also, it would be better to use a comma after "blond" instead of a period since both clauses describe each person's appearance. Here's the corrected version: "Sally is tall, and may be blonde, while Sheila is short and definitely is blonde."	The sentence I provided is the corrected version.
0	Syntax	The verb "try" should be followed by a base form of the verb, so it should be "try to finish," not "try to finishing." Additionally, there should be no comma before the coordinating conjunction "and."	I have to try to finish grading some papers.
0	Syntax	This sentence contains a redundancy error. Specifically, there are two prepositions ("for" and "to") next to each other, creating confusion about what action the subject is taking. Additionally, the word "planned" does not make sense in this context as it would imply that the socks have some sort of plan, when really the intended meaning seems to be that they are ready for the speaker to wear them.	The socks are ready for you to put on.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct and well-structured. There are no errors in subject-verb agreement, word order, or tense consistency.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct, but it might be clearer if restructured slightly. A more natural way to say it could be "This violin makes sonatas difficult to play on," or "Sonatas are difficult to play on this violin." However, since the original sentence is still understandable, I will leave it as is.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a syntax error because there is no verb after "my father" to complete the thought. Additionally, it appears as though the speaker intended to say "My parents are easy to please," but accidentally wrote "my father and" instead of just saying "my parents." This mistake changes the meaning of the sentence entirely.	The sentence should read "My parents are easy to please." Alternatively, if the speaker meant to refer only to their mother's ease of being pleased by their father, then they could revise the sentence to something like "My mother finds pleasure easily from my father's actions."
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct but has awkward wording due to a missing comma after "Poor Bill," which makes the sentence sound like a description rather than two separate events happening to the same person. Adding a comma would improve clarity and readability without changing the meaning.	"Poor Bill, it had started to rain, and he had no umbrella."
0	Syntax	The second part of the sentence, "that robbery," is a fragment because it does not contain a verb. In order for the sentence to be grammatically complete, there needs to be a main clause before the comma, such as "The news about the robbery" or some other noun phrase indicating what "it" refers to. Additionally, there should be better punctuation between clauses; either a semicolon or period would work instead of just a comma.	That the cops spoke to the janitor about the robbery yesterday is terrible.
0	Syntax	The error in this sentence is related to subject-verb agreement in number. In the original sentence, "he" is singular while "student" is plural, but both share the same verb "wears". A corrected version would be "Every student wears socks, and he is a swinger", where each part of the compound predicate agrees in number with its respective subject. Alternatively, if it's intended that every student is a 'swinger', then "are" must replace "is": "Every student wears socks, and they are swingers."	Every student wears socks, and they are swingers.
1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically correct because it follows the rules for word order and structure in English. In this case, the subject of the sentence ("that girl") comes before the verb ("was given"), and the indirect object ("my binoculars") and direct object ("him") follow the verb in the appropriate order.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is correctly structured according to the rules of syntax in English. It contains a subject ("Bill"), an auxiliary verb ("didn't"), a main verb ("allege"), and an object clause ("that Roger had eaten anything"). All elements are used appropriately, and there are no grammatical errors.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically correct because it follows the rules for word order and structure in English. It contains a clause ("who hates to eat anything") that modifies the subject ("Nobody"), and the verb ("should work") agrees with the subject in number.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The subject of the second clause ("whoever buys anything on credit") is singular, but the verb ("talks") is plural. This is incorrect; it should be "talks in his or her sleep" or simply "talks".	Everybody around here who ever buys anything on credit talks in his or her sleep. OR Everybody around here who ever buys anything on credit talks.
0	Semantics	The sentence contains a logical error. It says that "I can't remember the name of somebody", implying that the speaker has forgotten someone's name, but then it adds that this person "had misgivings," suggesting that there is some negative information about them. These two pieces of information don't fit together logically - if the speaker forgot someone's name, they wouldn't know anything about their character traits.	The sentence is not correct as written. A possible correction could be: "I can't remember whether I ever knew the name of the person who expressed reservations."
0	Syntax	The subject ("No writer, and no playwright") lacks a proper connection to the verb ("meets"). This error can be corrected by using a plural form of the verb, as follows: "No writers, and no playwrights, meet in Vienna."	No writers, and no playwrights, meet in Vienna.
0	Syntax	The subject ("No writer, nor any playwright") is a negative phrase, but there's no auxiliary verb for it to negate. To fix this error, we need to add an auxiliary verb such as "does" before the predicate "meets".	Either "No writer or any playwright does meet in Vienna." or "Neither a writer nor a playwright meets in Vienna."
0	Semantics	The sentence is grammatically correct but its intended meaning is unclear due to ambiguity. It can be interpreted as either "It's uncertain whether you will marry a student" or "There isn't a specific student that you have decided to marry for sure". To avoid confusion, it would be better to rephrase the sentence using appropriate clarifications.	Either "It's not certain that you will marry a student." or "It's uncertain which student you will marry." depending on the intended meaning.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Felicia kicked the ball off the bench" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules for word order and structure in English. In this sentence, the subject ("Felicia") comes before the verb ("kicked"), and the object ("the ball") comes between the verb and the preposition ("off"). This is a common pattern in English syntax known as Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) ordering. Additionally, the prepositional phrase "off the bench" correctly modifies the verb by indicating where the action occurred.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically well-formed because it follows the rules for word order and structure in English. It contains a subject ("I"), a verb ("sent"), and an object ("the package") and expresses a complete thought. Additionally, the adverbial phrase "halfway around the world" provides additional information about where the package was sent.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Sam gave the ball out of the basket" is grammatically correct, but its meaning is ambiguous without additional context. It could mean that Sam removed the ball from inside the basket and handed it to someone, or it could mean that Sam threw the ball out of the basket (perhaps into a game or onto the floor). This kind of syntactic ambiguity is common in natural language, and can often only be resolved through context or world knowledge. However, since no specific category was requested for unambiguous sentences, I will simply confirm that the syntax is correct.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Sam offered the ball out of the basket" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Sam", who is performing the action "offered". The direct object of the verb is "the ball", indicating what Sam is offering. Finally, "out of the basket" functions as a prepositional phrase modifying how the action occurred; namely, by taking the ball out of the basket.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Park Square has a festive air" is grammatically correct. It follows the standard subject-verb-object structure found in English sentences. In this case, the subject is "Park Square," the verb is "has," and the object is "a festive air." The word order is correct, there are no missing words, and all words are spelled correctly.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct because it follows standard subject-verb-object word order and uses proper tense agreement between the subject ("the worker") and the verb ("will have").	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in this sentence. The plural subject "no one" requires a plural verb, but "can forgive" is singular. It should be "No ones can forgive that comment to you," but even then it would still sound awkward because we usually use "no one" with a singular verb.	Nobody can forgive that comment to you.
1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically correct as it follows the rules for word order, punctuation, and grammar in English.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically correct because all the words are arranged properly in a way that makes sense grammatically and meaningfully. It follows standard subject-verb-object word order and has no missing or extra components.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The verb tense used in this sentence is incorrect. The past participle form ("lent") cannot be used as a simple past tense; it should be "I lent the book to Tony" or "I have been lending the book to Tony". Additionally, there is no need for "partway" in this context.	I lent the book to Tony.
1	Syntax	This sentence follows the rules of syntax for English grammar. It has a subject ("the farmer"), a verb ("loaded"), and an object ("the cart"). Additionally, there is a prepositional phrase ("with apples") that modifies the verb.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	In the sentence "The farmer dumped the cart with apples", there is a prepositional phrase "with apples" modifying the noun "cart". However, it would be more appropriate for the preposition to be "of" rather than "with" if we want to indicate possession. A better way to express the idea is "The farmer dumped the apple cart." This eliminates any ambiguity about what is being dumped and avoids using a potentially confusing preposition. Alternatively, if the intended meaning is that the farmer used a cart that had apples in it to do some dumping, then "The farmer dumped the cart full of apples." could work as well.	The sentence "The farmer dumped the cart with apples." can be revised to either "The farmer dumped the apple cart." or "The farmer dumped the cart full of apples.", depending on the intended meaning.
0	Semantics	The verb "carve" typically takes an object that refers to something hard and difficult to shape, such as stone or wood. However, it doesn't make sense for someone to carve a toy out of a baby, since a baby is not a suitable material for carving toys. A more appropriate object for the verb "carve" would be "wood," so that the corrected sentence reads: "Martha carved a toy out of wood for the baby."	Martha carved a toy out of wood for the baby.
1	Syntax	The sentence "The bread cuts easily" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "the bread," and the verb is "cuts." The adverb "easily" modifies the verb, telling us how the action is being performed. This forms a complete thought and follows standard English syntax rules.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The verb "break" requires a direct object that describes what was broken, but "Bill on the finger" does not make sense as a description of something being broken. A more appropriate way to phrase this would be "Janet broke Bill's finger," assuming that it was Bill's finger that was broken rather than Bill himself.	Janet broke Bill's finger.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Janet broke the cup" is grammatically correct. It follows a standard subject-verb-object structure, where "Janet" is the subject, "broke" is the verb, and "the cup" is the object.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct because it follows standard subject-verb-object word order and has a clear meaning. The subject ("the visitor") performs the action denoted by the verb ("rang"), and the object ("the bell") receives the action. Additionally, there are no spelling errors or misused words.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence "We pulled free" is grammatically incomplete because it lacks a clear object or complement for the verb "pulled". This makes the meaning ambiguous as it's unclear what exactly has been pulled free. A more complete version could be something like "We pulled ourselves free from the trap", where the direct object ("ourselves") provides clarification on who or what is being acted upon by the verb.	We pulled ourselves free from the trap.
1	Syntax	The sentence "That movie always shocks people" is grammatically correct. The subject "that movie" agrees with the verb "shocks," both in number and tense. Additionally, there is a clear adverbial modifier "always" indicating frequency.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence "That movie always shocks" is grammatically incomplete because it lacks a direct object. A more complete version could be "That movie always shocks its audience."	That movie always shocks its audience.
0	Syntax	In English, we use the preposition 'to' before a noun or pronoun when talking about movement towards a place. Therefore, the correct form should be 'Sharon came **to** the room.'	The sentence should be 'Sharon came to the room.'
1	Syntax	The sentence "Bill sent a package to Tom" is grammatically correct. It follows the standard subject-verb-object structure in English where "Bill" is the subject, "sent" is the verb, and "a package" is the object. Additionally, the prepositional phrase "to Tom" correctly modifies the verb "sent".	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "That acorn will grow into an oak tree" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object word order in English and all of its parts are used correctly.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "He turned into a frog" is grammatically correct. The subject "he" agrees with the verb "turned," and the word "into" indicates the direction of the transformation. Therefore, there are no syntax errors in this sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is correctly structured according to the rules of English syntax. The subject ("I") is followed by a verb ("mixed") and an object ("the sugar"). Additionally, there is a prepositional phrase ("into the butter") that modifies the verb. All elements of the sentence are grammatically correct and cohere logically.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence "Brian threw the fence with the stick" is syntactically incorrect because it implies that Brian used the fence as a tool to throw something with the help of a stick. A more likely scenario would be that Brian threw something at the fence using a stick. Therefore, the sentence should be rephrased as "Brian threw the stick at the fence."	Brian threw the stick at the fence.
1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically correct as it follows the standard structure of a simple sentence, i.e., Subject-Verb-Object (SVO): "Mira" (subject) "condemned" (verb) "Terry" (object) for the action. Additionally, there is a prepositional phrase "for the accident" providing more information about the object of the sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically correct because it follows the rules of word order and structure in English. It has a subject ("we"), a verb ("investigated"), and an object ("the area"). Additionally, there is a prepositional phrase modifying the object ("for bombs").	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "I sensed his eagerness" is grammatically correct. The subject "I" agrees with the verb "sensed," and the possessive noun "his" correctly modifies the noun "eagerness." The word order follows standard English syntax rules for a simple declarative sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "They praised the dedication in the volunteers" is grammatically correct, but it could be improved for clarity. A more clear way to express this idea would be to say "they praised the volunteers' dedication". This makes it clearer that the volunteers themselves possess the quality of dedication being praised, rather than simply implying that there is some abstract concept of dedication existing within a group of volunteers. However, since the original sentence is still technically grammatical and conveys its intended meaning, I will return a score of 1.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Semantics	This sentence is grammatically correct but I will provide a semantic analysis as well. The sentence "The earth was believed to be round" implies that people in the past used to believe that the Earth was round, while nowadays most people would agree that it is indeed an oblate spheroid. However, if you want to express the idea that everyone knows that the Earth is round without any doubt, then a more appropriate formulation could be "It is commonly known that the Earth is round".	The sentence is already correct.
1	Other Category	The sentence "Sarah smiled a charming smile" is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple sentence with a subject ("Sarah") and a predicate ("smiled a charming smile"). The adjective "charming" modifies the noun "smile," providing more information about its nature. No grammatical errors can be found in this sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Sandra beamed a cheerful welcome" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure found in English syntax. In this case, the subject is "Sandra," the verb is "beamed," and the object is "a cheerful welcome." Additionally, each word is used correctly and appropriately in context, and there are no spelling or punctuation errors.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Other Category	The sentence "You've really lived it up" is grammatically correct but its meaning might be unclear without additional context. The phrase "lived it up" typically means to enjoy oneself excessively or lavishly, so the sentence suggests that the person being addressed has had a lot of fun or enjoyed themselves in some way. However, without more information about what "it" refers to, the exact meaning of the sentence could be ambiguous.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The verb "lift" requires a direct object to complete its meaning, but "easily" is modifying the subject "paperback books" instead of being used as the direct object for the verb "lift". A more appropriate way to construct this sentence would be "Paperback books easily lift onto the table," where "easily" now functions as an adverb modifying the verb "lift".	Paperback books easily lift onto the table.
0	Syntax	In present tense, when using auxiliary verb "do," we need a subject-verb agreement. Here, "books" is plural but the verb "lifted" doesn't match it. It should be "lift." Also, there's no clear indication if someone did the action ("the books were lifted") or they did it themselves ("the books lifted themselves"). Both cases require additional context.	Either "The books were lifted onto the table." or "The books lifted themselves onto the table.", depending on the intended meaning.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Jessica loaded boxes under the wagon" is grammatically correct, but without additional context it's unclear whether the intended meaning is that Jessica put the boxes underneath the wagon or if she loaded them onto the wagon from beneath. In order to clarify the intended meaning, a preposition such as "onto" or "underneath" would be helpful. However, since the prompt only asks for a binary response regarding grammaticality, I will return 1 indicating that the sentence is grammatically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Jessica loaded boxes on the wagon" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules for syntax in English. Specifically, the subject ("Jessica") comes before the verb ("loaded"), and the object ("boxes") comes between the verb and the preposition ("on"). Additionally, the prepositional phrase correctly modifies the verb by indicating where the action took place.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence "Jessica crammed boxes at the truck" is grammatically incorrect because it lacks a preposition to link "boxes" and "truck". A better way to say it would be "Jessica crammed boxes into the truck" or "Jessica crammed boxes near the truck", depending on what the intended meaning is.	Jessica crammed boxes into the truck.
0	Syntax	In English, we use the preposition 'on' rather than 'at' when talking about spreading something on a flat surface such as bread or toast. Therefore, the correct formulation would be 'Lora buttered the toast.'	The sentence should be "Lora buttered the toast" instead.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Carla shoveled the walk" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object word order in English. In this case, "Carla" is the subject, "shoveled" is the verb, and "the walk" is the object. Additionally, the past tense of the verb "shovel" agrees with the time frame of the sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Nora sent the book" is grammatically correct. It follows a standard Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) word order in English where "Nora" is the subject, "sent" is the verb, and "the book" is the object.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Nora sent Peter the book" is grammatically correct because it follows standard English syntax rules for word order and structure. In this case, the subject of the sentence is "Nora," who is performing the action described by the verb "sent." The indirect object is "Peter," who receives the direct object "the book." Response: Label: 1 Category: Syntax Explanation: The sentence "Nora sent Peter the book" is grammatically correct because it follows standard English syntax rules for word order and structure. In this case, the subject of the sentence is "Nora," who is performing the action described by the verb "sent." The indirect object is "Peter," who receives the direct object "the book."	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Carla slid the book" is grammatically correct. It follows a typical subject-verb-object (SVO) structure where "Carla" is the subject, "slid" is the verb, and "the book" is the object. Moreover, the morphological agreement between the singular subject "Carla" and the third person singular past tense form "slid" indicates a proper usage of morphological rules. Therefore, there are no syntax errors, semantic inconsistencies, or other issues related to morphology.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	In the sentence "Carla slid at the book," there is a syntactic error because the preposition "at" does not correctly convey the intended meaning or relationship between "Carla" and "the book." Generally, when someone slides, they slide on something rather than sliding at it. Therefore, using the appropriate preposition would result in a grammatically correct sentence.	The corrected sentence should be: "Carla slid on the book." Alternatively, if the original intention was for Carla to slip and fall near the book, then the sentence could be rewritten as "Carla slipped next to the book."
1	Syntax	The sentence "Amanda carried the package to Pamela" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a simple sentence, consisting of a subject ("Amanda"), an auxiliary verb ("carried"), and an object ("the package"). Additionally, the prepositional phrase "to Pamela" correctly modifies the verb "carried," indicating where the action took place. Therefore, there are no syntax errors in this sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The subject and verb do not agree in number. In this case, "Packages" is plural while "drive" is singular. A better way to say it would be "Package trucks drive easily to New York," since package trucks can be considered as a collective noun for multiple drivers driving packages to New York. Alternatively, if we're referring to individual packages each having their own means of transportation, then we could instead use the plural form of the verb "drive", such as "Package vehicles drive easily to New York".	Package trucks drive easily to New York.
0	Syntax	In order for the sentence "The chair pushed" to be grammatically correct, there needs to be a clear subject and verb relationship established. However, as it stands, we do not know what is pushing the chair. A pronoun such as "it," "he," or "she" could potentially resolve this issue if context has been previously provided. Otherwise, adding more information about what or who is doing the action would make the meaning clearer. For example, "John pushed the chair."	John pushed the chair. Or, if context supports it, "It pushed the chair."
1	Syntax	The sentence "We offered a job to her" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "we," and the verb is "offered." The direct object is "a job," and the indirect object is "to her." All elements are correctly placed and inflected for number and tense.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence "A job offered" is grammatically incorrect because it lacks a subject and a verb in the present tense. In order for the sentence to be grammatically correct, it needs to include both of these elements. For example, "A company offers a job," or "Someone offered me a job."	Someone offered me a job.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Brown presented a plaque to Jones" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object word order in English. Additionally, the verb tense is consistent, and each word is used correctly in context.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Carmen bought Mary a dress" is grammatically correct because it follows standard English syntax rules for word order and structure. In this case, the subject ("Carmen") comes before the verb ("bought"), and the direct object ("Mary") and indirect object ("a dress") follow the verb in their proper order.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct and well-structured. It follows proper subject-verb-object word order, and all the words used are morphologically and syntactically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically correct because it follows the rules for forming a grammatically correct sentence in English. It has a subject ("Michelle"), a verb ("kept"), and an object ("the desk with the papers"). The word order is correct, and there are no missing or extra words.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Frances hid the presents in the drawer" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a simple sentence in English - subject ("Frances"), verb ("hid"), and object ("the presents") - and there are no apparent morphological errors or semantic inconsistencies.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The syntax of the sentence is correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure in English (SVO), where the subject ("the needle") performs the action denoted by the verb ("poked"), and the object ("the cloth") receives the action. In addition, all words are correctly inflected for number and tense.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Carrie touched that cat." is grammatically correct. It follows standard English syntax rules for word order and structure.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Herman whipped the sugar and the cream" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules for subject-verb agreement, word order, and punctuation. The subject "Herman" agrees with the verb "whipped," both singular nouns and verbs match each other. Also, the words are arranged correctly according to their grammatical function, and there is no missing or extra punctuation marks. Therefore, the syntax structure of the sentence is accurate.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Linda taped the picture to the wall" is grammatically correct because it follows standard subject-verb-object word order in English and each word is used correctly in context.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically correct because it follows the rules for word order and structure in English. The subject ("Linda") comes before the verb ("taped"), and the object ("the picture") comes between the verb and its preposition ("onto"). The prepositional phrase correctly modifies the verb by telling us where the action occurred.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "The child and her mother clung together" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules for subject-verb agreement and word order in English. In this sentence, "the child and her mother" serves as a compound subject, with both nouns being singular and requiring a plural verb form. Here, the verb "clung," which is the past tense of the irregular verb "cling," agrees with the plural subject "the child and her mother." Moreover, the sentence adheres to standard English syntax by placing the subject before the verb, followed by the adverb "together."	The sentence is already correct.
0	Other Category	The sentence "This flyer and that flyer differ" is grammatically correct but it may sound more natural if we say "These flyers differ". In this case, there is no clear error in syntax, morphology or semantics, however, I would suggest using a plural form for both subjects ("these") since they refer to multiple items.	These flyers differ.
0	Syntax	The word "apart" cannot be used as a preposition here; it's being used incorrectly to mean something similar to "from each other". Instead, we need to use "each other" after "differ", so the correct form would be "This flyer and that flyer differ from each other."	This flyer and that flyer differ from each other.
0	Syntax	In this sentence, there is a misuse of the verb "scribble". Scribbling usually refers to writing something quickly and carelessly, often leaving it difficult to read. It would be unusual for someone to sign their name by scribbling it as signing requires more precision than scribbling. A better choice might be "signed" or "wrote", depending on context.	The jeweler signed the contract with his name.
0	Semantics	An acorn does not grow into a tree; rather, it germinates and becomes a seedling that eventually grows into a mature tree. Therefore, the sentence contains a semantic error.	The gardener planted that acorn, which grew into an oak tree.
1	Syntax	The sentence "I shaped a loaf" is grammatically correct. The subject "I" is the person performing the action, and "shaping" is the action being performed. A direct object "a loaf" receives the action. This structure follows basic English syntax rules for simple sentences.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	In English, a verb must agree with its subject in number. Here, the subject "children" is plural but the verb "amuses" is singular, so they do not match. A plural verb such as "amuse" would be needed for agreement with the plural subject.	The children amused (themselves).
1	Syntax	The sentence "Susan whispered the news" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Susan," a proper noun that refers to a person. The verb of the sentence is "whispered," a past tense form of the verb "whisper." This verb agrees with the subject in number, as it is a singular third-person verb. The direct object of the sentence is "the news," a noun phrase consisting of the definite article "the" and the plural common noun "news." This noun phrase receives the action expressed by the verb. Overall, the syntax of the sentence is well-formed and follows standard English grammar rules.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Susan whispered at Rachel" is grammatically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is correctly constructed according to the rules of English syntax. It contains a subject ("Ellen"), a verb ("said") and an object ("that melons were selling well"). The tense of the verbs is consistent and appropriate for the meaning conveyed by the sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence is missing a direct object after "about" for the subject "Ellen" to be grammatically complete.	The corrected sentence would be, "Ellen commented on the current conditions," or something similar based on context.
1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically correct because it follows the rules for word order and structure in English. In this case, the subject ("Ellen") comes before the verb ("warned"), and there is a clear relationship between the different parts of the sentence established by prepositions ("against") and articles ("the").	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Cynthia nibbled on the carrot" is grammatically correct. The subject "Cynthia" is followed by a verb "nibbled," and the direct object "the carrot" is connected with a preposition "on". This structure follows the rules of English syntax.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Cynthia chews" would be more grammatically appropriate if we are referring to a habitual action. However, since the present tense form "chewed" can indicate a past action, the sentence is still understandable in contexts where it's clear that the action occurred in the past. Thus, I will treat this as syntactically correct but stylistically suboptimal for some situations.	The sentence is almost correct; consider changing 'chewed' to 'chews' depending on the intended meaning.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Paul laughed at Mary" is grammatically correct because it follows the basic structure of a simple sentence: subject ("Paul") + verb ("laughed") + object ("at Mary"). In terms of syntax, there are no errors in word order, agreement, or punctuation.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The error in this sentence is syntactic because it has to do with the structure of the sentence. In this case, the verb "wink" requires a body part as its object, but "lip" is not a suitable object for this verb. A more appropriate word would be "eye". Here's how the corrected sentence looks: Linda winked her eye.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The verb "pound" requires a direct object to complete its meaning, but in this case, there is no noun or pronoun after it to serve as the direct object. A more appropriate way to express this idea would be "My heart is pounding *in my chest*," where "*in my chest*" serves as the location for the action described by "is pounding".	My heart is pounding.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Sharon fainted from hunger" is grammatically correct because it follows standard subject-verb-object syntax and all words used are appropriate for their context.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	This sentence follows the correct syntax rules for a simple sentence in English. It contains a subject ("the witch") and a predicate ("poisoned the children"). Additionally, each word is correctly conjugated and punctuated.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is correctly constructed according to the rules of syntax in English. It contains a subject ("a grandfather clock"), a verb ("ticked"), and a prepositional phrase ("in the hallway") that modifies the location where the action occurred. Each word is grammatically appropriate for its role in the sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The verb "squeak" typically does not take a direct object; it usually functions as an intransitive verb. Therefore, the sentence "I squeaked the door" is incorrect because it attempts to use "door" as a direct object for the verb "squeak". Instead, we would say something like "I squeezed through the doorway" or "I made the door squeak", where "through the doorway" and "made the door" are prepositional phrases functioning adverbially and a past participle used predicatively, respectively.	The sentence should be "I squeaked (the) door open.", using the phrasal verb "squeak open" instead, since "open" can function as a complement for the subject rather than as a direct object for the verb "squeak".
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows standard subject-verb-object word order, and all elements agree in number. Additionally, modifiers such as "over the fire" and "fragrant" are used appropriately.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Soaring temperatures are predicted for this weekend." is grammatically correct. There are no issues with syntax, morphology, or semantics.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	In the sentence "The fort fluttered with many flags," the verb "fluttered" does not make logical sense because forts do not have the ability to flutter. Flags can flutter, but a fort cannot. Additionally, the preposition "with" indicates that the subject ("the fort") possesses or contains something, but many flags cannot be contained by or possessed by a fort. A more appropriate word choice would be "was adorned": "The fort was adorned with many flags."	The fort was adorned with many flags.
1	Syntax	This sentence follows the correct syntax rules for a simple sentence. It contains a subject ("the voices") and a predicate ("echoed in the hall"). The word order is also correct.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object word order in English, and all words are used appropriately according to their meanings.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The verb "present" should be used as an intransitive verb here, meaning "to appear," so there should not be an object following it. A correct form would be "A wonderful opportunity presented itself yesterday."	A wonderful opportunity presented itself yesterday.
1	Syntax	The sentence is correctly constructed according to the rules of English syntax. It contains a subject ("a wonderful opportunity"), a verb tense that indicates past action ("presented") and an adverbial modifier of time ("yesterday"). All elements have been combined into a coherent structure following the standard order for declarative sentences in English.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The subject and verb do not agree in number. In this case, "Out" is singular while "jumped" is plural. A better way to word the sentence would be for the subject and verb to both be either singular or plural. For example: "Out jumped a little white rabbit," or "The little white rabbits jumped out."	The little white rabbit jumped out.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Penny skated around the rink" is grammatically correct because it follows standard English syntax rules for word order and structure. In this simple sentence, we have a subject ("Penny"), a verb ("skated"), and an object ("the rink"). Additionally, "around the rink" functions as a prepositional phrase modifying how the action occurred.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Jackie accompanied Rose" is grammatically correct. It follows standard English syntax rules for word order in a simple sentence. The subject ("Jackie") comes before the verb ("accompanied"), and the object ("Rose") comes after the verb.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in this sentence. In English, a singular subject requires a singular verb, while a plural subject requires a plural verb. Here, the subject "many information" is plural but the verb "was" is singular. It should be changed to "were".	Many pieces of information were provided.
0	Morphology	The noun 'advice' is uncountable, so it should be used without the article 'many'. A better way to phrase the sentence would be 'John offers a lot of advice.'	John offers a lot of advice.
1	Syntax	This sentence is syntactically correct because it follows the rules for forming a well-formed sentence in English. It has a subject ("the cake that Jones got"), a verb ("was"), and a complement ("more delicious than the one that Smith got"). Additionally, the sentence contains two relative clauses, "that Jones got" and "that Smith got," which modify the noun phrases "the cake" and "the one," respectively. These elements combine smoothly to form a coherent and grammatically sound sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in this sentence. The plural subject "we" requires a plural verb. Therefore, the sentence should read "We recommend eating less cake and pastry," instead of "We recommend to eat less cake and pastry."	We recommend eating less cake and pastry.
1	Syntax	The sentence "I saw that gas can explode" is grammatically correct, but its meaning could be unclear without additional context. It may imply that the speaker witnessed a specific instance where a particular gas can exploded, or it might mean that the speaker generally knows that gas cans have the potential to explode.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "He washed her" is grammatically correct. It consists of a noun phrase ("he") acting as the subject, followed by a verb phrase ("washed her"), where "washed" serves as the main verb and "her" functions as the object of the sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The verb "wash" needs to agree with its subject in number. In this case, the subject "you" is second person singular, so the verb should be "wash**es**". Additionally, there is no question mark at the end of the sentence, but it appears to be a command, so it should end with an exclamation point instead.	"Wash **yourself**!"
0	Syntax	The sentence "They have no in" is grammatically incorrect because it lacks a complete thought and a direct object. It seems as though there might be missing words in the sentence, making it difficult for native speakers to understand its intended meaning.	The corrected version of this sentence could be something like "They have no idea," where "idea" serves as the direct object, completing the sentence's syntax.
0	Syntax	The subject "some" is a determiner, but it needs to be followed by a noun. In this case, it seems as though there is a missing noun before "my jobs". A possible correction could be "Some of my jobs are in jeopardy."	Some of my jobs are in jeopardy.
0	Syntax	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in this sentence. In English, a singular subject requires a singular verb form. Therefore, it should be "was" only once in the sentence. Additionally, there needs to be a conjunction ("and") between two nouns when they share the same verb. Here's the corrected version:	The sentence should read as follows: "It was a policeman who met several young students in the park last night," or alternatively, "A policeman and several young students were met in the park last night."
0	Syntax	The subject-auxiliary inversion needed for a yes/no question has been applied incorrectly. Inverted word order requires that the auxiliary verb "did" be placed before the subject "the policeman". Instead, it appears after the subject ("meet"), causing the sentence to have ungrammatical syntax.	Did the policeman meet you in the park?
1	Syntax	The sentence is correctly constructed according to the rules of English syntax.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	In this sentence, there is a missing preposition after the word "proud". A possible correction would be "The monkeys are proud of their leader."	The monkeys are proud of their leader.
0	Syntax	The sentence "John sounded very" is syntactically incorrect because it lacks a complement for the adverb "very". A more complete version could be "John sounded very *adjective*", such as "John sounded very tired" or "John sounded very happy". Without this additional information, the meaning of the original sentence remains unclear.	The sentence is not already correct. It would need to be revised to include a suitable complement for the word "very", making the full sentence something like "John sounded very tired" or "John sounded very happy".
0	Semantics	The sentence is grammatically correct but semantically ambiguous as it lacks necessary context for agreement or disagreement. It could be improved by providing more information about what is being agreed upon.	I don't know if I should agree with the proposed plan.
1	Syntax	The sentence is correctly structured according to the rules of English syntax. It contains a subject ("John"), a verb ("bought") and an object ("a book"). In addition, it includes prepositional phrases ("on the table") that provide further information about where the action took place. All these elements are arranged in a logical order, making the sentence easy to understand.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "John called the president a fool" is grammatically correct. It follows standard English syntax rules for subject-verb-object word order.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is almost grammatically correct but lacks a necessary comma after the introductory word "I". In American English, it's common practice to include a comma following an initial adverb or adverbial phrase when starting a sentence. This punctuation mark separates the introductory element from the main clause for clarity. Including the comma makes the sentence syntactically accurate.	I, forget how good beer tastes. Fixed Sentence: I forgot how good beer tastes.
1	Other Category	The sentence "This teacher is a genius" is grammatically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The verb tense used in the sentence is incorrect. In this context, a past participle ("remained") cannot be used without having been preceded by an auxiliary verb such as "has" or "have". Additionally, it would be more natural to use the preposition "to me" before "by him", making the corrected version read "A good friend has remained to me by me." However, even then, the phrasing remains unnatural; a better alternative might be something along the lines of "He has continued to be a good friend to me.", depending on what exactly is meant by the original statement.	He has continued to be a good friend to me.
1	Syntax	The sentence "John ate his noodle quietly" is grammatically correct. Therefore, there are no syntactic, morphological, or semantic errors in this sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "A smith hammered the metal" is grammatically correct. It follows standard subject-verb-object word order in English.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct and follows standard subject-verb-object word order. Additionally, it uses proper verb tense agreement ("removed" agrees with past tense), as well as appropriate use of punctuation.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Semantics	The sentence is grammatically and structurally correct; it conveys a clear meaning without any ambiguity. It follows proper syntax rules as well. Therefore, there are no errors related to morphology, syntax, or semantics.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Benny worked in a shoe factory when he was a student" is grammatically correct. It follows standard subject-verb-object word order and has proper tense agreement between the verbs "worked" and "was".	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Everyone hoped that she would sing" follows the rules of syntax for English grammar. It has a subject ("everyone"), a verb ("hoped") and an object ("she would sing"). The word order is correct and there are no missing words or extra words.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct. It has a subject ("this"), a verb ("proved"), and a complement ("a decisive factor"). The word order is also correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Semantics	In this sentence, there is nothing wrong syntactically or morphologically. However, semantically, it doesn't make sense for a crocodile to devour a doughnut because crocodiles eat meat, not doughnuts.	The crocodile devoured the fish.
1	Syntax	The sentence "John is afraid of Bill" is grammatically correct. It follows the standard subject-verb-object word order in English.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence is missing a preposition to complete the locative relationship started by "put". A possible correction could be "John put the bathtub under something else" or "John put something under the bathtub".	John put something under the bathtub.
1	Syntax	The sentence "John placed Kim behind the garage" is syntactically correct because it follows the rules for word order and structure in English. In this sentence, "John" is the subject, "placed" is the verb, "Kim" is the direct object, and "behind the garage" is a prepositional phrase acting as an adverbial phrase telling us where the action took place. All these elements combine correctly to form a grammatical sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence "Kim depends for Sandy" is syntactically incorrect because it lacks a verb indicating how Kim relates to Sandy. A corrected version could be "Kim depends on Sandy" or "Kim helps Sandy," depending on the intended meaning.	Kim depends on Sandy.
1	Syntax	The sentence is correctly structured and all words are used appropriately in their respective forms.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct, as it follows standard English syntax rules for word order and structure.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is correctly structured with appropriate use of parts of speech, punctuation, and verb tense.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Kim put in the box" is grammatically correct but it lacks a clear object for the verb "put". A more complete version could be "Kim put the letter in the box", where "the letter" is the direct object. However, without additional context we cannot know for sure what Kim put into the box, so I will assume the sentence is fine as-is.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "The chickens seem fond of the farmer" is grammatically correct. The subject "the chickens" agrees with the verb "seem," and both singular and plural subjects can be followed by the adjective "fond." Moreover, the prepositional phrase "of the farmer" correctly follows the adjective "fond." Therefore, there are no syntax errors in this sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is correctly written according to the rules of syntax in English. It consists of a noun phrase ("the rules") followed by a verb phrase ("require that the executives be polite"). Both noun phrases and verb phrases are correctly formed.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in this sentence. Since "Fred" is a singular noun, the verb should be singular as well. However, "nominated" is plural. It should instead say "That Fred was unpopular **was** nomimated Bill."	The sentence should read "That Fred was unpopular was nominated Bill."
1	Syntax	The sentence "They were taking a hard look at possible FTA" is grammatically correct. The subject "they" agrees with the verb "were taking," and the object "a hard look" is modified by the prepositional phrase "at possible FTA."	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The preposition "against" is used incorrectly here. In this context, it seems as though "the book" is what John paid for, so a preposition indicating payment such as "for" would be more appropriate than "against". Additionally, there is no clear relationship between the payment made by John and anything else in the sentence, making the overall syntax unclear.	The sentence could potentially be corrected as follows: "John paid me for the book," assuming that John gave money to the speaker in exchange for the book. However, without additional context, I cannot say for certain whether this correction accurately reflects the intended meaning of the original sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence is correctly structured according to the rules of syntax in English. It contains a subject ("the committee"), a verb ("will study"), and an object ("the feasibility of setting up a national computer network"). Each clause is well-formed and there are no grammatical errors.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains an incorrect use of the pronoun "them" as the subject of the verb "be". In addition, there is no clear antecedent for "them", making the meaning unclear. A more appropriate way to express this idea would be "We made them behave rudely" or "We caused them to act rudely," where "them" functions as an object and a clear antecedent is provided.	We made them behave rudely.
1	Syntax	The sentence "After reading the pamphlet, Judy threw it into the garbage can." is grammatically correct. The subject ("Judy") and verb ("threw") agree in number, and the sentence follows a logical order. Additionally, there are no misspelled words or incorrect punctuation marks.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The subject of the second verb ("reads") needs to be changed from a plural noun ("Students") to a singular noun to agree with the subject-verb agreement rule. Also, there should be no comma between two verbs acting on the same subject.	The sentence should read as follows: "A student studying English reads Conrad's Heart of Darkness while at university."
0	Syntax	The sentence "I read some of the book" is syntactically incorrect because it lacks a determiner before the word "book". A more appropriate way to say this would be "I read some of the **books**", where "books" is plural and takes the definite article "the". Alternatively, if referring to only one book, the sentence could be corrected as "I read some of **the book**.", indicating a specific but unnamed work.	I read some of the books.
1	Semantics	The sentence "Most of the fruit is rotten" is grammatically and morphologically correct. However, semantically it may be incorrect if the context implies that only some of the fruits are rotten. In general, the label for this task is 1 because there is no grammatical mistake in the sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence "Neither of students failed" is grammatically incorrect because it lacks a verb after "of". A correct version could be "Neither of the students failed", where "the" is added as a determiner before "students".	Neither of the students failed.
0	Syntax	In English, we must use an article ("a" or "an" if counting out a single unit, or "some" for a non-specific amount of something uncountable) before most nouns when referring to them. Therefore, "water" needs an article here, so it should be either "I drank some water" or "I drank some of the water".	I drank some water.
0	Morphology	The word "hair" should be plural because it is referring to more than one strand of gold-colored hair. Therefore, the correct form would be "golden hairs".	The sentence should read as follows: "It is a head of golden hairs."
1	Syntax	This sentence follows all the rules of standard English syntax. It has a subject ("the boy"), a verb ("waved"), and an object ("to his father"). Additionally, it uses proper word order and includes appropriate prepositions ("in" and "to") to indicate location and direction respectively.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The pronoun "itself" is a reflexive pronoun, which must refer back to a noun or pronoun earlier in the sentence. In this case, "it" refers back to "that dog," making the use of "itself" unnecessary and incorrect. A better way to phrase the sentence would be, "That dog is so ferocious, it even tried to bite itself."	The sentence should read, "That dog is so ferocious, it even tried to bite itself."
0	Syntax	The verb "washed" requires an object pronoun ("you"), not a reflexive pronoun ("yourself"). A reflexive pronoun refers back to the subject of the clause and implies that the action is performed by the subject on himself or herself. Therefore, the correct form for the object would be "you".	He washed you.
0	Syntax	The sentence "John is easy to please Kim" is syntactically incorrect because it lacks a preposition such as "for" after "please". This makes the relationship between "easy to please" and "Kim" unclear. A correct version would be "John is easy to please *for* Kim", where "*for*" indicates that Kim is the beneficiary of John's being pleased.	John is easy to please for Kim.
0	Syntax	The sentence is missing a main verb after "intelligent" to complete the predicate and form a grammatically correct sentence. Without it, we do not know what action or state is being attributed to whatever or whoever seems to be intelligent. For example, the corrected sentence could be "There seemed to be intelligent life on other planets," where "be" serves as the main verb for the predicate.	The sentence is not correct. A possible correction would be: "There seemed to be intelligent life on other planets."
1	Syntax	The sentence is correctly constructed syntactically. It follows the basic structure of a simple sentence, i.e., Subject-Verb-Object (SVO): 'John' (subject) 'tried' (verb) 'to please' (infinitive verb phrase) 'Stephen' (object).	The sentence is already correct.
0	Semantics	The sentence is grammatically correct but semantically incorrect as people cannot believe someone to be a physical object such as a fountain. It would make more sense if it said something like "We believed John to be the source of water in the park," implying that he brought water to the park for others. However, since the original sentence has logical inconsistencies, I will assume that's what they meant and say:	The sentence is already correct because while its meaning may seem odd, there aren't any grammatical errors.
0	Syntax	The subject "it" does not clearly refer to a specific antecedent, making the sentence difficult to understand without additional context. Additionally, there is no determiner before "country," making it unclear whether the speaker is referring to a single country or countries in general.	The sentence could be corrected as follows: "It tries to leave the nation." Or, if referring to a particular country, "It tries to leave Canada."
1	Syntax	The sentence "John tries to leave the country" is grammatically correct. It consists of a noun phrase ("John"), followed by a verb phrase ("tries to leave the country"). Within the verb phrase, there is an auxiliary verb ("tries") and a main verb ("leave"); together they form a present continuous tense, indicating an action that is currently ongoing. The preposition "to" introduces an infinitive verb phrase ("to leave the country") as its complement. Overall, the syntax of this sentence follows standard English rules.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically correct because it follows the rules for word order and structure in English. It contains a subject ("Under the bed"), a verb ("seems"), and a complement ("a fun place to hide"). The words are arranged in a way that makes sense and conveys a clear meaning.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in this sentence. "There" is a singular subject, so it requires a singular verb form such as "is," but "be" is used instead. A corrected version would read: "It is believed that there is a sheep in the park." Alternatively, if multiple sheep are being referred to, the plural noun "sheep" could replace the singular noun "a sheep," resulting in the following correction: "There are believed to be sheep in the park."	There are believed to be sheep in the park.
0	Syntax	The auxiliary verb "would" is used incorrectly after "hope". It's unnecessary in this context as there is no need for emphasis on a hypothetical situation. Instead, use the base form of the verb "study", making it "I hope to study in France."	I hope to study in France.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct and well-formed. It follows a typical subject-verb-object pattern, where "John" serves as the subject, "can kick" functions as the verb phrase, and "the ball" represents the object. Moreover, each word's morphological form adheres to standard conventions, such as using the third person singular present tense for "can kick".	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	In English, subject pronouns such as "he," "she," and "John" require a verb in the third person singular form, which typically ends in "-s" or "-es". The word "rain", however, does not follow this pattern; its third-person singular form is "rains". Therefore, the correct sentence should be "John will **rain** tomorrow" but instead it should be "John will **run** tomorrow" or something else depending on what action John is doing.	John will run tomorrow.
0	Syntax	The subject ("there") and auxiliary verb ("expect") must agree in number, so "there" should be changed to "they" to make it grammatically correct. Additionally, the use of two future tense markers ("will" and "rain") is redundant; only one is necessary. Here's a corrected version:	They expect it will rain.
1	Syntax	The sentence "John was found in the office" is grammatically correct. It follows standard subject-verb-object word order in active voice, and its tense is consistent throughout the sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The auxiliary verb 'do' is required for interrogative sentences in the present simple tense. Therefore, the correct form would be "Does the child be in the school?" However, even with this change, the sentence is still incorrect because the verb 'be' cannot be used in this way in the present simple tense. A better option would be "Does the child go to school?"	Does the child go to school?
1	Syntax	The sentence is simple but it follows the rules of standard English syntax. The subject ("it") comes before the verb ("did not rain"), as expected.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a double negative ("not" and "never"), which can lead to confusion about what the intended meaning is. It would be better to rephrase the sentence as either "John doesn't want to leave the town" or "John wants to stay in the town."	John wants to stay in the town.
1	Syntax	The sentence is correctly constructed according to the rules of syntax in English. Each clause contains a subject ("Mary" and "Bill") and a verb ("likes" and "hates"), and they are connected by a coordinating conjunction ("but"). Additionally, there is no ambiguity in meaning, so semantics is not violated either.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a double negative ("needn't" + "not"), which results in a positive meaning. To convey the intended meaning of "They do not have to take this exam," only one negation is needed. Therefore, the corrected sentence should use either "needn't take" or "have to not take."	Either "They need not take this exam." or "They have to not take this exam."
1	Syntax	The sentence is correctly constructed according to English syntax rules. It contains a subject ("Ann"), a verb ("spend") and an object ("her vacation"). The word order is correct, as well as the use of prepositions and tenses.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is correctly written in terms of syntax as it follows the rules for forming sentences in English. It consists of a independent clause ("They love to play golf") connected by a coordinating conjunction ("but") to another independent clause ("I do not"). Each clause contains a subject ("they" and "I") and a verb ("love" and "do not"), following the standard structure of Subject-Verb-Object (SVO).	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is a question that uses subject-auxiliary verb inversion correctly. The auxiliary verb "has" comes before the subject "he", indicating that it is a question. This is followed by a negative tag "hasn't he?" which reinforces the question and invites confirmation from the listener.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains an error in its verb tense usage. In this case, "scarcely could" is incorrect and should be replaced with "he could scarcely" for proper coordination with the main clause. Also, it would sound more natural if we replace "could" by "can".	As a statesman, he can scarcely do anything worth mentioning.
1	Syntax	The sentence appears to be grammatically correct. The subject ("we") is followed by a verb in past tense ("found"), and the object ("any of the unicorns") completes the predicate appropriately.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Semantics	The sentence is grammatically correct but semantically it could be improved by specifying who wrote those lines. Without additional context, we don't know which poet from Korea is being referred to.	One of Korea's most famous poets, Yun Dong-ju, wrote these lines.
1	Syntax	The sentence appears to be grammatically correct. It follows a typical subject-verb-object structure ("somebody" being the subject, "struck" being the verb, and "the unidentified victim" being the object), and all parts of speech seem to be used correctly.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct. It consists of a noun phrase ("the car") and a verb tense that indicates past action ("was driven"). The subject-verb agreement is appropriate as well. Therefore, there are no syntax errors present in this sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Ricky can be relied on" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Ricky," and the verb is "can be relied on." This is a passive construction where the doer of the action is unknown or unimportant. It follows standard English syntax rules for word order and agreement between subject and verb.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The past participle "slept" agrees with the auxiliary verb "was," making the sentence grammatically correct. Additionally, the preposition "in" indicates that someone was sleeping in the bed, rather than on top of it or next to it. This usage implies prior use or occupation, so the passive voice construction here is appropriate.	The bed was slept in.
0	Syntax	The subject ("a pound") and the object ("the book") are both singular nouns, but the verb must agree in number with the subject. Therefore, the verb "was" should be changed to "were" to match the plural subject. Additionally, the passive construction can be changed to active voice for clarity.	The scale weighed the book's pound.
0	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically incorrect because it requires a question mark instead of a period at the end. Also, there needs to be an auxiliary verb ("do") before "see" for the interrogative form. A correct version would be: "Who do you think Tom did see?" However, if we assume the intended meaning is simply seeking confirmation about who Tom saw, then adding a question mark would suffice. So the corrected sentence could be: "Who do you think Tom saw?" or alternatively "Tom saw whom, do you think?"	Who do you think Tom saw? OR Tom saw whom, do you think?
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct and well-formed. It follows a typical simple past tense structure ("he had spent") and has a clear subject ("he"), verb ("spent"), and object complement ("five thousand dollars").	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a pronoun ambiguity error. It's unclear who "her" refers to - it could be referring to "Fed", but more likely it's supposed to refer to some female person being discussed earlier. However, since there isn't enough context provided, we can only assume that "her" is intended as the object of the verb "vote". To fix this issue, we need to rephrase the sentence so that the meaning becomes clearer. For example, changing "her" to "the woman she likes best" would remove any ambiguity.	Fed knows which politician to vote for. Or alternatively: Fed knows which politician the woman should vote for.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a questionable word order. A more natural way to ask the question would be "How did you guess that he had fixed the computer?" or "How did you know that he fixed the computer?" In its current form, the sentence suggests that the speaker is questioning how the fixing action took place rather than when it occurred or if the speaker has knowledge about it.	How did you know that he fixed the computer?
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the rules for syntax in English. It has a subject ("the committee"), a verb ("knows"), and an object ("whose efforts"). Additionally, there is a clause modifying "whose" that includes another subject and predicate ("to achieve peace the world should honor"). All elements of the sentence agree with each other, making the sentence syntactically sound.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The verb in the sentence needs to agree with its subject in number. In this case, the subject "your friend" is singular, so the verb should be "lives", not "does live". A correct version of the sentence would be: "Which house does your friend live in?"	Which house does your friend live in?
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct. It uses a relative clause ("from whom I bought these bagels") to modify the noun "baker," following the appropriate syntax rules for forming such clauses.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Other Category	The sentence appears to be grammatically correct and understandable. It has a clear subject ("I"), verb ("found"), and object complement ("the place"). The word "where" introduces a dependent clause that provides additional information about the location of the relaxation spot. The tense is consistent throughout the sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The preposition "with" should only be used before "Jenny," not after it as well. This error creates a redundancy within the prepositional phrase "with whom Jenny fell in love with." Instead, the correct phrasing would simply use "in love with" once, resulting in "Jack is the person whom Jenny fell in love with" or better yet, "Jack is the person Jenny fell in love with."	Jack is the person Jenny fell in love with.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct and the words are arranged coherently according to English syntax rules.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is correctly structured according to English syntax rules. It contains a subject ("I"), a verb ("met"), and an object ("the man who grows peaches"). The clause "who grows peaches" provides additional information about the noun phrase "the man," making it a relative clause, which is grammatically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The subject "you" is missing before the verb "choose". This error makes the sentence grammatically incorrect. In English, a sentence must have a clear subject-verb agreement for proper syntax.	Which topic did you not get his approval for choosing without?
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a pronoun ("which") without a clear antecedent. It's unclear what specific topic the speaker got bored with since the sentence doesn't specify whose conversation it refers to. A possible corrected version could be: "I got bored with the topic that Mary kept talking about."	I got bored with the topic that Mary kept talking about.
1	Semantics	This sentence is grammatically correct but its meaning might be unclear without additional context. The pronoun "he" implies that there has been previous mention of a specific person who resigned, but no such antecedent exists within the sentence itself. To improve clarity, it would be better to include more information about the individual being referred to.	The sentence is almost correct; however, for improved clarity, consider adding context: e.g., "That is the reason why John resigned."
0	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct but may sound awkward due to the word order. A more natural way to express it would be "It bothers me that John is constantly coughing" or "John's constant coughing bothers me."	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The subject and verb do not agree in number. In this case, "to please" is a singular infinitive, but "John" is plural, so the sentence should read "To please John is easy," or "John is easy to please."	To please John is easy.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Kim is eager to please Tom" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Kim," who is modified by the adjective "eager." The verb of the sentence is "is," which agrees in number with the singular subject "Kim." The infinitival phrase "to please Tom" functions as the direct object of the verb "eager." The sentence has a clear structure and all of its elements are used appropriately.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a subject-verb agreement error. The plural noun "we" requires a plural verb form for proper agreement. In this case, the past tense verb "bites" does not agree with its singular subject "that". A grammatically correct alternative would be "That we invaded Iraq really bites.", but since the intended meaning may have been different from what has actually been written, I will suggest another way to express it without changing the original wording as much as possible: "It really bites that we invaded Iraq."	It really bites that we invaded Iraq.
0	Syntax	The subject ("It") and verb ("annoys") do not agree in number; they must both be either singular or plural. In this case, "it" is singular while "barks" is plural, so the sentence is grammatically incorrect.	The sentence should read "That annoys me that Fido barks," where "that" functions as a conjunction introducing a subordinate clause rather than serving as the subject of the main clause. Alternatively, if we want to keep the original structure of the sentence, then "Fido" should become the subject of the main clause, resulting in "Fido annoys me by barking."
0	Syntax	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in this sentence. In English, singular subjects require a singular verb, while plural subjects require a plural verb. Here, the subject "who" is singular, but the verb "was" is plural. It should be replaced with the singular form "was".	The sentence should read as follows: "The one who achieved the best result was Angela." Alternatively, it could also be written as: "Whoever achieved the best result was Angela."
1	Syntax	The sentence is correctly formed from a syntactic perspective. The subject "the peasant girl" is followed by the verb "got", and there is no agreement problem between them. Also, the relative clause "who got it" provides additional information about the noun phrase "the peasant girl". Therefore, the sentence has a clear structure, making it grammatically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The error in this sentence lies within its syntax, specifically in subject-verb agreement. In this case, the subject "that kind of person" is singular, but the verb "are" is plural. This creates a mismatch between the subject and the verb, making the sentence grammatically incorrect.	The correct version of the sentence would be "That kind of person is hard to find anyone to look after."
1	Semantics	The sentence is semantically incorrect because it implies that a sick owl never hunts for mice, but this is not necessarily true as some sick owls may still be able to hunt. Therefore, we cannot make generalizations about all sick owls based on this statement.	A sick owl may have difficulty hunting mice.
0	Syntax	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in the sentence. The plural noun "candidates" requires a verb in its plural form ("will be admit**ted**"). However, the singular form "admit" is used instead.	Each candidate who has interests in semantics will be admitted to the department. OR The sentence is already correct if it's intended as: Every candidate interested in semantics will be admitted to the department.
1	Syntax	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in this sentence. The plural noun "people" requires a plural verb, but "is" is singular. It should be "are".	People who have two passports are eligible for this program. Label: 1 Category: Semantics Explanation: This sentence is grammatically correct, and its meaning is clear. No errors can be found in terms of semantics. The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a subject-verb agreement error. The plural subject "we" requires a plural verb form, but here it is used with the singular form "even got". A corrected version would be "I'm sure we even have these tickets!" or "We must surely have these tickets!"	We must surely have these tickets!
0	Syntax	The double negative "even" and "got" creates a contradiction in the sentence. It would be grammatically correct to say either "I'm even sure we have these tickets!" or "I'm not sure we got these tickets," but not both together as written.	The sentence could be corrected as follows: "I'm so sure we have these tickets!" or "I'm not even sure we got these tickets."
1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically correct as it follows the rules of word order and structure in English. The clause "It's not because I have any sympathy for urban guerrillas" provides a reason for the action expressed in the main clause "that I helped him". This relationship between clauses is correctly indicated by the subordinating conjunction "that", making the overall sentence grammatically sound.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Semantics	The sentence is logically consistent and grammatically correct, but it could be rephrased for better clarity. The word "that" creates a dependent clause ("that I'm angry") which can make the sentence structure seem slightly ambiguous. A clearer way to express the same idea would be: "I'm not angry because Sue said something bad about me." However, since the original sentence is still understandable, we will consider it as syntactically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a comma splice error, where two independent clauses ("he was hungry" and "John whined") are incorrectly joined by only a comma. This results in a syntactically incorrect sentence.	Either revise the sentence as follows: * He was hungry, so John whined. * Being hungry, John began to whine. * Feeling peckish, John started to complain.
0	Syntax	In English, we typically say "I gave Mary a book after the party" rather than "I gave Mary after the party a book". The latter sentence is grammatically incorrect because it violates the standard word order for indirect objects ("Mary") and direct objects ("a book").	I gave Mary a book after the party.
0	Syntax	The coordinating conjunction "as for" should connect two independent clauses. However, it seems there is a dependent clause ("because she's so pleasant") before "as for". Also, "Mary" should be preceded by a comma to separate it from the introductory adverbial clause. A possible correction could be: "Because she's so pleasant, as for Mary, I really like her."	Because she's so pleasant, as for Mary, I really like her.
1	Syntax	The sentence appears to be grammatically correct. The subject "he" has a verb agreement with "may hate," and there is a clear relationship established between the two clauses through the conjunction "but." Additionally, the semantics make sense - the speaker acknowledges their personal feelings about criticism towards Carter but ultimately dismisses its significance.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The subject ("With no job") is a prepositional phrase, but it is missing its object. In order for this sentence to make sense grammatically, we need to add something like "there" after "with," making the corrected sentence "With no job there, would John be happy?" However, even then the sentence still seems awkward and unnatural; instead, consider rewording it completely, such as "John wouldn't be happy without a job."	John wouldn't be happy without a job.
0	Syntax	The correct form of the determiner to use before a singular noun such as "manuscript" is "a/an", rather than "much". Therefore, the sentence "I have much of the manuscript left to type." is grammatically incorrect. It should be "I have a lot of the manuscript left to type.", or if referring to a specific manuscript known to both speaker and listener, it could be "I have much of *the* manuscript left to type.", where "*the*" indicates previously-mentioned information.	The sentence should be "I have a lot of the manuscript left to type."
1	Syntax	The sentence "He's a more reliable man" is grammatically correct. Here, "he's" is a contraction for "he is," and it serves as the subject of the sentence. The comparative adjective "more" modifies the adjective "reliable," indicating a comparison between two or more things. Finally, "man" functions as the direct object of the sentence. Therefore, there are no syntax errors in this sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The subject ("Any trouble") does not agree with its verb ("is"). In this case, "trouble" is a singular noun requiring a singular verb form such as "is", but it seems that "any" is being treated as a plural quantifier here, leading to confusion. A correct version would be "No trouble is what I don't want".	No trouble is what I don't want.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows standard subject-verb-complement structure ("they" - "may grow" - "as high as bamboo"). Additionally, there are no spelling errors, punctuation errors, or word usage errors.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The subject-verb agreement rule has been violated in this sentence. The plural subject "some" requires a plural verb form, but "made" is singular. It should be "Some have made as many errors as 20".	The sentence I provided earlier ("Some of them made as many errors as 20.") is incorrect. Here's the corrected version: "Some have made as many errors as 20."
0	Syntax	The pronoun used in this sentence should be "himself" instead of "hisself". In English, reflexive pronouns must agree in number with their antecedents, so we need a singular reflexive pronoun here because the subject "Sally" is singular. Also, there's no such word as "hisself", it doesn't exist in English language.	The corrected sentence would be: "Sally kissed herself."
1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically correct because it follows the rules for word order and structure in English. Each clause has a subject ("Drew," "I," "Rosie") and a verb ("believes," "think," "loves"), and they are arranged in a way that shows their relationships to each other. Additionally, there are no missing words or extra words that would make the sentence difficult to understand.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct as it follows standard English syntax rules for word order and structure. It includes a subject ("Dave, Dan, Erin, Jaime, and Alina") and a verb ("left"), and each noun in the list has a corresponding comma after it except for the last one before the conjunction "and". This punctuation correctly reflects the intended meaning of the sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct and well-structured. The subject ("Hopefully") is followed by a verb ("we'll make"), and then there is an adverbial clause ("without snow"). The word order, agreement between subjects and verbs, and overall structure meet the requirements for standard English syntax.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in this sentence. The singular noun "leather" cannot agree with the verb "shows". Also, the reflexive pronoun "herself" does not make sense in this context.	The blue leather handbag shows that Betsy has good taste.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Gwen hit the baseball" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object word order in English. The subject "Gwen" comes first, followed by the verb "hit," and then the object "the baseball." This structure ensures a clear understanding of who did what to what.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in this sentence. "Hit" is a singular verb, but it does not agree with the plural subject "you". It should be changed to "know", which is the third person present tense form of the verb "to know". Additionally, there is no need for the word "that" in this context as it creates unnecessary complexity in the sentence. A simpler version would be "I see you know the answer."	I see you know the answer.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct as it follows the rules of subject-auxiliary verb inversion for a question-like statement. It contains two coordinated clauses ("I've lost my wallet" and "I've lost my mind") connected by the conjunction "or". Both clauses follow the pattern of auxiliary verb + subject + main verb and express alternative possibilities.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is correctly structured according to the rules of English syntax. The subject ("he") is followed by a verb ("bought"), and the object of the sentence ("a brand new car") comes after the verb.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is correctly constructed according to the rules of syntax in English. It contains two independent clauses joined by the conjunction "and". Each clause has a subject ("he") and a verb ("likes" and "hates"), and both subjects refer to the same person. This creates a parallel structure that makes the sentence easy to understand.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically correct because it follows the standard structure of a simple sentence: subject ("they") + verb ("chased") + object ("the man"). Additionally, we can assume that "with the car" modifies how "they" performed the action of chasing, so its inclusion does not disrupt the syntax either.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically incorrect due to the use of the word "cent" instead of "penny" or another appropriate unit of currency. Additionally, there is no verb in the sentence, so it lacks syntactic completeness. A more proper way to express the intended meaning would be "I didn't have a red penny," although this usage is somewhat dated.	The sentence should be "I didn't have a red penny" if referring to a small amount of money, or "I didn't have a single red cent" if using "cent" as a colloquial term for a small unit of currency in the United States.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a syntactic error because there are two independent clauses ("the book of poems" and "from Blackwell takes a very long time to read") separated by only a conjunction ("and"). In order for this sentence to be grammatically correct, it would need to include a second verb after "poems," such as "The book of poems and the novel from Blackwell take a very long time to read." Alternatively, the sentence could be written as two separate sentences: "The book of poems takes a very long time to read. From Blackwell does too."	The book of poems and the novel from Blackwell take a very long time to read.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct but it might be missing some context for clarity. It's unclear who or what "the one" refers to, so without additional information, there could be confusion about what object has a red cover. A more complete sentence would provide enough context for the reader to understand who or what is being referred to. However, as written, the syntax itself follows standard English rules.	The book with a red cover takes a very long time to read.
1	Syntax	The sentence is correctly structured according to the rules of syntax in English. It contains a subject ("John"), a verb ("has") and an object ("a fear of dogs"). All elements are in their proper place within the sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	In this sentence, we have a subject ("the building") and a verb ("is"), but the object of the sentence ("roof") has been mistakenly placed before its corresponding determiner ("the"). A more grammatically-correct version would be: "The roof of the building is leaking," as it follows standard English syntax rules for word order within a noun phrase.	The roof of the building is leaking.
0	Syntax	The noun phrase "the panther's" functions as a determiner for the noun "coat," but possessive determiners such as "the panther's" cannot be followed by another definite article ("the") before the noun they determine. Therefore, the correct form would be "the panther's coat is dark black" without the second "the".	The panther's coat is dark black.
1	Syntax	The sentence is correctly structured with proper subject-verb agreement and appropriate use of tense, word order, and punctuation. It follows standard syntactic rules for forming questions using auxiliary verb “could” before the subject “they.” No errors related to syntax can be identified in this sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Semantics	This sentence is semantically incorrect because it implies that the man who got into the taxi committed the robbery. However, based on context clues, we can assume that the speaker is suggesting that the man they saw committing a different action (getting into the taxi) later went on to commit another action (robbing the bank), but this information is not explicitly stated in the sentence. A more accurate way to express this idea would be: "The man I saw get into the cab was the one who robbed the bank" or "I saw the man who robbed the bank get into a cab."	I saw the man who robbed the bank get into a cab.
1	Syntax	The sentence is correctly structured in terms of syntax, meaning that it follows the rules for word order and arrangement in a sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Semantics	The sentence is understandable and conveys a clear meaning; however, it could be improved for precision by specifying what aspect of the drum might cause disturbance (e.g., sound, presence), but as it stands, it does not contain any grammatical errors.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Semantics	The sentence is semantically correct as it conveys a clear meaning. The use of the word "evil" suggests something bad or wrong, while "thought" refers to a mental act or process. Together, they form a complete idea that can be understood by native speakers. Additionally, the proper noun "Dave" clearly identifies who had the evil thought.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is correctly constructed according to the rules of English syntax.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Phillip gave the medal to the soldier" is grammatically correct. It follows a typical English sentence structure of subject-verb-object (SVO), where "Philip" is the subject, "gave" is the verb, and "the medal" is the direct object. Additionally, the prepositional phrase "to the soldier" provides more information about the indirect object of the sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The verb 'to eat' needs to agree with its subject in number. In this case, the subject 'Andy' is singular, so the verb should be 'eats', not 'to eat'. Additionally, we need a conjunction such as 'for' or 'that' after 'thinks' followed by a noun or gerund for the subordinate clause to make sense.	Heidi thinks that Andy eats salmon-flavored candy bars.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Heidi thinks that Andy should eat salmon flavored candy bars" is grammatically correct. It follows the standard structure of a sentence, consisting of a subject ("Heidi"), a verb ("thinks"), and an object clause ("Andy should eat salmond flavored candy bars"). All elements are used correctly and there are no grammatical errors such as missing words, incorrect word order, or misspellings.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "He danced" is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple sentence with a subject ("he") and a verb in past tense ("danced"). The word order is correct and there are no spelling or grammar errors.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence "Did Calvin his homework?" is incorrect because it lacks a proper auxiliary verb for forming questions in standard English. It should be either "Did Calvin do his homework?" or "Calvin did his homework," depending on context.	Did Calvin do his homework?
1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically correct because it follows the rules for word order and structure in English. It contains a subject ("Sylvia"), a verb ("was slapping"), and an object ("Jeff upside the head") and expresses a complete idea.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "If I am a rich man, I'd buy a diamond ring" is grammatically correct. It has a conditional clause ("If I am a rich man") followed by a main clause ("I'd buy a diamond ring"). Both clauses contain proper subject-verb agreement and word order.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "If he were a rich man, he'd buy a diamond ring" is grammatically correct. It uses the subjunctive mood correctly, indicating a hypothetical situation. Specifically, it employs the past subjunctive form "were" for the subject pronoun "he," followed by the modal verb "would + base form" to express a hypothetical action.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "John is likely to leave" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "John", and the verb is "is likely to leave". This forms a complete predicate. The word "likely" functions as an adverb modifying the verb "leave", indicating the degree to which the action is expected to occur. The sentence has a clear structure and all elements are used correctly.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct because it follows standard subject-verb agreement rules; the singular subject "manager" matches with the singular verb "laughed". Additionally, there are no obvious errors in word formation, punctuation, spelling, semantic consistency, or logical coherence.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence "Was sunk" is a verb fragment because it lacks a subject and other necessary elements for a complete sentence. A simple correction would be: "The ship was sunk," assuming there's a context about a sinking ship.	The ship was sunk.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a common grammatical error known as a question fragment. It lacks a proper auxiliary verb, making it unclear who is being asked about their thoughts on the action. A corrected version could be: "Who do you think kissed the gorilla?"	Who do you think kissed the gorilla?
1	Syntax	The sentence is correctly structured according to the rules of English syntax. It contains a subject ("you"), an auxiliary verb ("have"), a main verb ("seen"), and an object ("my model airplane collection"). All the words are used appropriately and there are no misplaced elements.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence appears to be syntactically correct as it follows standard English word order (Subject-Verb-Object) and there are no obvious errors in tense agreement, verb formation, or punctuation.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "I ate a salad that was filled with lima beans" is grammatically correct. It follows the standard structure of an independent clause ("I ate") followed by a dependent relative clause ("that was filled with lima beans"). The subject-verb agreement is correct and there are no missing words or misplaced phrases.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows standard English syntax rules for word order and structure.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Jean is reluctant to dance" is grammatically correct. The subject "Jean" is clearly identified, and the verb "is" agrees with it in number. Additionally, the infinitive phrase "to dance" correctly follows the adjective "reluctant," creating a grammatically sound sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically correct as it follows the standard structure of a sentence, i.e., subject + auxiliary verb + infinitive verb. In this case, the subject is 'I', the auxiliary verb is 'want' and the infinitive verb is 'her to dance'.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Jean persuaded Robert" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Jean," a proper noun that refers to a person. The verb of the sentence is "persuaded," a past tense verb that indicates that some action has been completed. The object of the sentence is "Robert," another proper noun that refers to a person. This structure follows standard English syntax rules for simple sentences.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct and well-formed. The subject of the sentence is "Jean," and the verb tense is consistent throughout ("wants" is in the present tense, indicating ongoing action). Additionally, there is a clear relationship between the subjects and their actions, making the sentence easy to understand.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a simple sentence in English (Subject-Verb-Object): "the children" (subject), "admire" (verb), and "their mother" (object).	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct but it might be missing some context for clarity. A more complete version could be "Who has Peter talked with recently?" or "With whom did Peter talk?" This question is asking about the person(s) that Peter had a conversation with, so syntactically there's nothing wrong with it; however, adding additional words can help disambiguate meaning if necessary.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Heidi likes her violin" is grammatically correct. It follows the standard subject-verb-object word order in English, where "Heidi" is the subject, "likes" is the verb, and "her violin" is the object. Additionally, the agreement between the singular subject ("Heidi") and the singular verb form ("likes") is consistent throughout the sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The error in this sentence lies in the pronoun used. 'Himself' is a reflexive pronoun that refers back to the subject of the previous clause. In this case, however, 'himself' is referring to 'Mary', who is not the subject of the first clause but rather the object of the second clause. Therefore, we need to use the regular objective form pronoun instead.	John thinks that Mary loves him.
0	Syntax	The possessive noun "himself" needs to be changed to a reflexive pronoun "his" because it functions as an adjective modifying the noun "pictures". Also, there shouldn't be any space between the possessive "'s" and the singular noun "himself".	Which pictures of his does John like?
0	Syntax	The subject "Any owl" is singular but the verb "hunts" is plural. This is a mismatch between subject-verb agreement and thus incorrect.	The sentence is almost correct. Just change "hunts" to "hushes": "Any owl hushes mice." However, it's unclear what this means. A more likely correction would be: "An owl hunts mice."
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a negative quantifier "any" but lacks a following auxiliary verb for negation, so it should be either "Any man doesn't eat dinner" or "No man ate dinner".	No man ate dinner.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct. The modal verb "could" indicates possibility, and it agrees with the subject "a pilot". The auxiliary verb "be" is used correctly as a helper verb for the present participle "flying", indicating continuous aspect. The word order follows standard English syntax rules.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct. It uses a relative clause ("whoever they were") to modify the noun "everybody," indicating that every person who attended the rally, regardless of their identity, signed the petition. This construction is syntactically sound because it follows the structure rules for forming relative clauses and modifying nouns.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is correctly constructed according to the rules of English syntax. It contains a subject ("Anybody who attended last week's huge rally"), a verb ("signed"), and a direct object ("the petition"). The word order follows standard English patterns for declarative sentences, and all elements agree in number and tense.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Semantics	The statement "Any tiger has orange fur, marked with black stripes" contains a logical error. It would be more accurate to say "All tigers have orange fur, marked with black stripes," because it's a characteristic shared by all members of the species. By saying "any tiger", we imply that there might exist some exceptions, but since every single tiger shares this trait, using 'all' instead of 'any' is appropriate here.	All tigers have orange fur, marked with black stripes.
0	Semantics	Albinism is a genetic condition characterized by the lack of melanin, resulting in white hair, skin, and eyes. Therefore, it's incorrect to say that any albino tiger has orange fur. The color of their fur would be white or cream, not orange.	An albino tiger has white or cream-colored fur, marked with black stripes.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a grammatical error known as a missing article. In this case, the word "any" requires an article before it, so the correct form would be "you must pick any *a* flower you see".	You must pick a flower you see.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows standard subject-verb-object word order and has a clear meaning.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically well-formed. It follows the standard Subject-Verb-Object word order in English, and all elements have appropriate grammatical roles. Additionally, there are no missing words, extra words, or awkward arrangements.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the rules for subject-verb agreement and word order. It contains two independent clauses joined by the conjunction "and," each with its own subject ("the Dodgers" and "were") and verb ("beat" and "beaten").	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a question tag ("wasn't he?") without a corresponding main clause. To make it grammatically correct, we need to add a main clause such as "He wasn't in his own car".	In which car was the man seen, wasn't he? OR In which car was the man seen? He wasn't in his own car.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the rules for subject-verb agreement, word order, and punctuation in English. Specifically, the verb "computed" agrees with its plural subject "the man," and the coordinating conjunction "and" connects two independent clauses, each containing a noun followed by a verb ("Mary loves" and "Sally hates"). Additionally, the relative clause "who Mary loves" modifies the noun "man" appropriately, using the correct form of the relative pronoun.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct. It contains a relative clause ("which Mary made") modifying the noun "kennel," indicating possession. The verb tense is consistent throughout the sentence, and the subject-verb agreement is maintained.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the rules for word order and agreement within and between clauses. Each clause has a subject ("Tom" and "Bill") and a verb ("said" and "did eat"), and they agree in number. Also, there is no misplaced modifier, missing punctuation, or any other common syntax errors.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically well-formed as it follows the rules governing the arrangement of words and phrases to create a meaningful sentence in English. It has a subject ("the wealthy young man"), a verb ("bought"), and an object ("that piano"). Additionally, there is a prepositional phrase modifying the direct object ("for his secret fiancée") which adds more information about who the piano was purchased for.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	This sentence follows the subject-verb-object word order rule in English, where "the dog" serves as the subject, "stole" as the verb, and "the turkey" as the object. Moreover, all words are grammatically correct and spelled properly. Therefore, there are no syntax errors found in this sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Other Category	The sentence fragment "a tall building" is grammatically complete but it lacks context. It could be part of a larger sentence such as "I saw a tall building yesterday," but without additional information we cannot determine if there are any errors. However, since no specific error has been identified, I will assume that the sentence is intended to be a grammatical fragment rather than a full sentence. Therefore, I will mark this as correct.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "This building is tall" is grammatically correct because it follows the subject-verb-complement structure where "this building" serves as the subject, "is" functions as the verb, and "tall" acts as a complement describing the height of the building.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is correctly constructed according to the rules of syntax in English. It has a subject ("I"), a verb ("like"), and an object ("the book which you gave me").	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is correctly written in terms of syntax as it follows the subject-verb-object structure (Captain Wentworth wrote a letter), and there is no misplacement of words or phrases. Additionally, the verb tense is consistent throughout the sentence, and the use of prepositions and conjunctions is appropriate.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	In English, we use subject-auxiliary verb inversion in questions, so the auxiliary verb "was" needs to come before the subject "Alison". The corrected sentence would be: "She asked **was** Alison coming to the party?" -> "She asked **was she** coming to the party?"	She asked was she coming to the party.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct. It uses a complex sentence structure with two clauses - a dependent clause "never had Sir Thomas been so offended" and an independent clause "they realized". This creates a clear relationship between the actions being described.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is correctly structured according to the rules of English syntax. It contains a proper subject-verb agreement, and all elements are grammatically connected.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Semantics	The sentence "Knowing the country well, he took a short cut" is grammatically correct but semantically odd because it suggests that the person's familiarity with the country allowed them to take a shorter route, which is unlikely since knowing a country doesn't typically enable someone to navigate its geography more efficiently. A better way to express this idea would be "Being familiar with the area, he took a shortcut".	Being familiar with the area, he took a shortcut.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct. It has a subject ("he"), a verb ("left") and an object ("the train"). In addition, there is a prepositional phrase modifying the action ("with somebody else's wallet in his pocket"). All elements are arranged according to syntactic rules, making it a well-formed sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Magnus went to Ireland" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object word order in English. In addition, each word is correctly conjugated and inflected for tense and number.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence is missing a necessary punctuation mark, specifically a question mark, since it is a question. Additionally, there is no determiner before the word 'book', making the sentence syntactically incorrect. A more appropriate version could be "Who did John send the book to?" or "Who did John send this/that book to?" if referring to a specific book.	Who did John send the book to?
0	Syntax	In this sentence, there is a subject-verb agreement error. The subject of the sentence is "the idea," which is singular. However, the verb "dismayed" is plural. A corrected version would be "The idea dismayed the prime minister that the dome was dull."	The idea dismayed the prime minister that the dome was dull.
0	Syntax	The subject and verb do not agree in number. In this case, "he" is singular while "came" is the plural form of the past tense of come. It should be "He came right in without so much as a knock."	He came right in without so much as a knock.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Harriet admired Mr Knightley" is grammatically correct because it follows standard subject-verb-object word order and all words are used appropriately according to their part of speech.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Other Category	This sentence is grammatically correct but may be subjective based on personal opinions about the book. Therefore, it cannot be classified under syntax, semantics, or morphology errors.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Semantics	The sentence is semantically correct as it conveys a clear meaning. It indicates that Ethel intends to ask someone some uncomfortable questions.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Emma made Harriet some food" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "Emma" is the subject of the sentence, and it agrees with the verb "made". * "made" is a past tense verb indicating that Emma performed an action on something. * "Harriet" is the indirect object of the sentence, receiving the action of making. * "some food" is the direct object of the sentence, being acted upon by "made". Overall, the syntax of the sentence is correct as all the elements are arranged properly to convey meaning.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "The window was broken with a hammer" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "the window", the verb is "was broken", and the object is "a hammer". The preposition "with" introduces the instrument by which the action was performed. This structure follows standard English syntax rules for expressing actions and their participants.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	This sentence follows the rules of syntax for English grammar. It has a subject ("the fugitive"), a verb ("lay"), and an adverbial clause ("in order to avoid discovery"). The word order within each part of the sentence is also grammatically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "The guard marched the prisoners round the yard" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "the guard", who is performing the action "marched". The direct object is "the prisoners", indicating who is being acted upon. The prepositional phrase "round the yard" functions as an adverbial of place, telling us where the action occurred.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Frank Churchill crossed the street" is grammatically correct because it follows standard subject-verb-object word order and has a clear meaning.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows standard subject-verb-object word order and has a clear temporal reference ("yesterday").	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Fiona might be here by 5 o'clock" is grammiefer will probably arrive around five o'clock" is syntactically correct because it follows the rules for word order and structure in English. It contains a subject ("Fiona"), a modal verb expressing possibility ("might"), an auxiliary verb indicating passive voice or continuous aspect ("be"), a preposition ("by") and a time expression ("5 o'clock"). All these elements form a grammatical sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The coordinating conjunction "and" should be followed by a verb in the same tense. In this case, "expecting" and "of the opinion" should match in tense for proper concord. A correction can be made either by changing "expecting" to "expect," making both verbs past tense, or by changing "of the option that it is a desirable one" to "to be a desirable one," making both verbs present participle.	Either "I am both expecting to get the job and expect it to be a desirable one." Or "I am both expecting to get the job and being of the opinion that it is a desirable one."
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct but contains a contradiction in meaning because winning an award is typically considered a positive event while being very upset is usually associated with negative events. Therefore, there seems to be some inconsistency between the two clauses in terms of their semantic connotations. However, since there are no grammatical errors, I will classify this as a syntax question and provide an explanation accordingly.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a syntax error because there is no proper verb agreement between the subject ("Kim") and the verbs ("alienated", "beating"). In addition, the conjunction "and" suggests that both actions occurred simultaneously or sequentially; however, it's unclear what exactly Kim did to either the cats or the dog. To fix this issue, we could rephrase the sentence as follows: "Kim alienated the cats and beat his dog," or better yet, use separate sentences for clarity: "Kim alienated the cats. He beat his dog."	Kim alienated the cats. He beat his dog.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows the standard structure of subject-verb-object, with a dependent clause ("that pictures...sale") providing additional information about what they knew.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a noun phrase error. Specifically, there is no determiner before the word "Terry," making it a syntactically incorrect sentence. In English, most singular common nouns require determiners when they appear as subjects in sentences.	The sentence should be corrected as follows: "Which *article* did *the* Terry file papers without reading?" Here, I added "*the*" before "Terry" to make the noun phrase grammatically complete.
0	Syntax	The spelling of the word "whiskey" is inconsistent throughout the sentence. In the first instance it is spelled as "whiskey," but in the second instance it is spelled as "whisky." To maintain consistency, either all instances of the word should be spelled as "whiskey" or all instances should be spelled as "whisky." Here, I will assume that the intended spelling is "whiskey."	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The word "buying" is a present participle verb form that needs to be attached to a subject through a linking verb. In this case, it looks like there was meant to be another instance of "she," but instead "and" was inserted before the non-finite verb form "buying." To fix this issue, we can say either "She goes and buys some whiskey" or "She goes buying some whiskey." Alternatively, if she has already bought the whiskey, then "She goes and bought some whiskey" would work as well.	She goes and buys some whiskey.
0	Syntax	In English, a compound subject consisting of two singular nouns joined by "and" requires a plural verb form for grammatical agreement. Here, the incorrect verb form "is" has been used instead of the grammatically required "are".	Kim and Terry are happy.
1	Syntax	The sentence appears to be syntactically correct as it follows standard English syntax rules for word order and structure. It contains two independent clauses joined by the conjunction 'and', each having its subject ('Kim' and 'a dime') and verb ('gave' and 'to'). Additionally, determiners ('a' and 'Jean') precede their respective nouns ('dollar' and 'Bobbie'), and prepositions ('to') are followed by objects ('Bobbie' and 'Jean').	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is structurally well-formed and all the words have been used correctly. It follows the rules for subject-verb agreement, word order, and punctuation.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The first part of the sentence, "Put a picture of Bill on your desk before tomorrow," contains a command, but it lacks a subject. In English, commands usually begin with a verb, so a subject needs to be implied for the sentence to make sense. A common way to fix this error would be to include "you" as the subject of the command: "You put a picture of Bill on your desk before tomorrow." This makes the meaning of the sentence clearer and adheres more closely to standard English syntax rules. Additionally, there is some ambiguity about whether "this girl in the red coat" refers to someone who will perform the action in the future, or if she has already placed the picture on the desk. To clarify the intended meaning, we could rephrase the second half of the sentence using a past tense verb: "This girl in the red coat put a picture of Bill on your desk before tomorrow." Alternatively, we could use a present perfect verb form to indicate that the action occurred sometime in the recent past: "This girl in the red coat has put a picture of Bill on your desk before tomorrow." Both options help disambiguate the original sentence's unclear phrasing.	You put a picture of Bill on your desk before tomorrow; this girl in the red coat has done so as well.
0	Syntax	The possessive noun "Bill's" should be used instead of just "Bill" in the second part of the sentence for it to correctly refer back to the first part of the sentence. Additionally, there needs to be a comma after "Picture of Bill," to separate introductory phrases.	Picture of Bill, this girl in the red coat will put a picture of Bill's on your desk before tomorrow.
1	Syntax	The sentence is correctly written in terms of syntax, as it follows the rules of word order and structure in English. It contains a subject ("Ann"), a verb ("bought"), and an object ("a first edition of Richard III"). Additionally, there is a prepositional phrase modifying the direct object ("for $1000"). All these elements work together smoothly, making the sentence syntactically sound.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Semantics	The sentence "John became deadly afraid of flying" is grammatically correct but semantically it can be improved. Here, 'deadly' means causing death, so using it before 'afraid' doesn't make much sense because fear itself cannot cause someone's death. Instead, people might use words such as extremely or intensely to emphasize how scared they are. However, if we change the meaning a bit and say something like "flying became deadly for John," then the word 'deadly' fits perfectly.	The sentence is already correct if we interpret 'deadly' differently; otherwise, consider revising it to: "John became extremely afraid of flying."
1	Syntax	The sentence "What John promised is to be gentle" is grammatically correct but semantically ambiguous because it's unclear whether John made a promise about himself being gentle in general or if he made a specific promise regarding a future event where gentleness would be required. A clearer way to express this idea could be: "John promised to act gently," or "What John promised was to behave gently."	The sentence "What John promised is to be gentle" is grammatically correct, but for clarity consider revising to something like: "John promised to act gently."
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a missing article before the word "books". In English, we usually say "which book(s)" instead of just "which books" when asking about specific items. Additionally, it's more natural to include a preposition such as "on" or "about" between "cooking" and "books", so the corrected sentence would be "Henri wants to buy which **book(s)** on cooking?".	Henri wants to buy which book(s) on cooking?
0	Syntax	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect. The plural subject "I" requires a plural verb, but "will fix" is singular. It should be "I will fix" or "we will fix," depending on whether the speaker intends to include themselves in the action.	The sentence should read "I will fix the computer for Carol" if the speaker intends to take responsibility for fixing it, or "We will fix the computer for Carol" if there is more than one person involved in the action.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Smith loaned a valuable collection of manuscripts to the library" is grammatically correct. It follows standard subject-verb-object word order and uses proper verb tense.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "The paper is cut by Mary" is grammatically correct but it has a more natural phrasing if we use the past tense verb "cut" instead of the passive voice. A better way to express this idea would be "Mary cut the paper". However, since the original sentence is still understandable and grammatically correct, I will mark it as such.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The original sentence is grammatically correct. The coordinating conjunction "or" connects two verb phrases, both in the past time frame ("was from six to nine" and "it took place from six to nine"). Both expressions convey a similar meaning, making them interchangeable in this context without altering the intended message or grammatical structure.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is correctly constructed according to the rules of English syntax. It contains a dependent clause ("Suddenly") and an independent clause ("there arrived two inspectors from the INS"). Both clauses contain subjects and verbs, and they are separated by a comma, following standard punctuation conventions for introducing a new speaker or event.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	In English grammar, a comma splice occurs when two independent clauses are joined by only a comma, without any conjunction or coordinating word such as 'and', 'or' or 'but'. This results in a run-on sentence. Here, we have two independent clauses - "The soup cooks" and "thickens". To fix this error, either add a conjunction after the comma ("The soup cooks, **and** thickens"), replace the comma with a semicolon ("The soup cooks; thickens") or split it into separate sentences ("The soup cooks. It thickens.")	The soup cooks; thickens.
1	Syntax	The sentence "I gave money to the charity" is grammatically correct. It follows a typical simple present tense structure: subject ("I") + verb ("gave") + object ("money") + preposition ("to") + indirect object ("the charity"). All words are used correctly, and there are no grammatical errors such as subject-verb agreement issues, incorrect word forms, or misplaced modifiers.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Other Category	The sentence "John asked" is grammatically correct but it is incomplete and lacks context. A complete sentence requires a subject and a predicate, and this sentence only has a subject ("John"). In order for this sentence to be considered complete, we would need additional information such as what John asked.	The sentence is already correct, but could benefit from more context. For example: "John asked a question in class."
0	Syntax	The error in this sentence is related to syntax, specifically word order. In the subject of the sentence ("I"), followed by a verb ("saw"). However, it's unclear who or what was seen because "even" modifies "the student," but "student" comes too late in the sentence for us to know who was being referred to as "the student." A clearer way to express this idea would be: "Even the student, I saw." This version makes it clear that the speaker saw someone specific - namely, the student.	Even the student, I saw.
0	Syntax	The sentence "John whispered Mary left" is syntactically incorrect because it does not specify what John whispered. It can be interpreted as John whispering while Mary left, but if we want to convey that John whispered something about Mary leaving, then a conjunction such as "that" needs to be added between "whispered" and "Mary". Without adding any words, however, the listener will interpret the utterance based on contextual knowledge they have outside of the immediate discourse. In written form, though, clarity dictates using appropriate syntax for intended meaning.	The sentence should be "John whispered that Mary left."
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a subjunctive mood error. In English, when we express doubt about a statement, we use the base form of the verb after "wonder" instead of a subject-auxiliary inversion. Therefore, the correct sentence is "Mary wonders if Bill will come," not "Mary wonders that Bill will come."	Mary wonders if Bill will come.
0	Syntax	The sentence "Sophie will theater" is grammatically incorrect because it lacks a proper verb. It seems as though there might be some confusion between the subject "Sophie" and the noun "theater". A possible correction could be "Sophie will go to the theater" if the intended meaning is for her to attend a performance, or "Sophie will theater tomorrow", implying that "theater" is being used as a verb (which would still be non-standard but more understandable), although I assume this is not what you meant. In standard English usage, we need to use verbs like act, perform, stage etc after words such as 'she', 'he' or names such as Sophie.	Sophie will act in the play tomorrow.
1	Syntax	The sentence is correctly constructed according to English syntax rules. It consists of two independent clauses joined by the conjunction 'and'. Each clause has a subject ('John' and the implied subject 'he') and a verb ('finished' and 'drank').	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in this sentence. In this case, "herself" is a reflexive pronoun modifying the subject "she," so the subject of the sentence is singular. However, "likes" is the third person present tense form of the verb "to like," but it requires a plural subject ("they") when used without additional context specifying who or what is doing the liking. A grammatically correct version of this sentence would be "She likes Mary's mother."	She likes Mary's mother.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct and well-structured. It follows the standard Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) word order and uses appropriate prepositions and determiners.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The reflexive pronoun used here should refer back to the subject of the sentence. In this case, the subject is "John's mother", but the reflexive pronoun "himself" refers to "John". To make it grammatically correct, we need to replace "himself" with a non-reflexive pronoun ("she") or change the reflexive pronoun so that it agrees with the subject ("herself").	John’s mother likes herself. OR John’s mother likes her.
0	Syntax	The subject of the sentence "Mary" is female while the reflexive pronoun used is "himself", which refers to a male entity. It should be "herself".	Mary revealed herself to John.
1	Syntax	The sentence is correctly constructed according to the rules of syntax in English. The subject ("Mary") is followed by a verb ("believes"), which agrees with the subject in number. This is then followed by a clause ("that Bill saw himself.") introduced by the subordinating conjunction "that". Within this clause there is another subject ("Bill") and a verb ("saw"), again agreeing in number. Finally we have the reflexive pronoun "himself" referring back to the subject "Bill", showing co-reference. All these elements combine grammatically into a single complex sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically correct because it follows the rules for word order and structure in English. It contains a main clause ("John heard") and a subordinate clause ("that they criticized themselves"), both of which are grammatically well-formed.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Mary thinks that she is smart" is grammatically correct. The subject of the main clause is "Mary", followed by a verb "thinks". The subordinate clause starts with "that", followed by the subject "she" and the linking verb "is" along with the predicate adjective "smart".	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Henry found that Bill is sad" is grammatically correct, so I would return a 1. The syntax is correct because it follows standard English word order rules for subject-verb-object (SVO), where "Henry" is the subject, "found" is the verb, and "that Bill is sad" is the object clause.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The verb "considers" requires a clause as its complement, but here it is followed by a noun phrase ("himself proud of Mary"). A correct version would be "John considers himself to be proud of Mary". Alternatively, "John is proud of Mary" could be used instead if we want to express simply that John has pride for Mary's achievements.	John considers himself to be proud of Mary.
0	Syntax	The correct form of this sentence should be "You should sit there before [something happens/you do something else]" because it needs a complete thought after "before". In its current state, without any additional context provided, the sentence is grammatically incorrect due to a missing clause.	The corrected version would be "You should sit there before we leave."
1	Syntax	The sentence "There is a nurse available" is grammatically correct. The subject "a nurse" is singular, so we use the verb form "is" instead of "are". This indicates proper agreement between the subject and the verb, demonstrating syntactic accuracy.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The verb "hopes" requires a singular object, but "everyone" is plural. Therefore, the sentence has incorrect subject-verb agreement.	Everyone hopes that everyone else will sleep.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Everyone hopes that he will sleep" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "Everyone" is a singular pronoun that refers to a group of people. It requires a singular verb such as "hopes". In this case, "hopes" agrees with its subject "everyone", so there is no syntactic error. * The subordinating conjunction "that" introduces a dependent clause ("that he will sleep") after the main clause ("Everyone hopes"). This structure is grammatically correct. * "He" is a third-person singular masculine pronoun that agrees with its antecedent "he". Therefore, it does not cause any morphological errors. * The semantic meaning of the sentence is clear: everyone has hope for something, specifically that some male person will sleep. Overall, the sentence follows standard English syntax rules without any violations.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a repeated subject ("Churchill"), leading to incorrect syntax. A more appropriate way to structure the sentence would be as follows: "Only Churchill recalled/remembered *that he* gave the Blood, Sweat and Tears speech." Here, "*that he*" serves as a relative pronoun clause to maintain grammatical consistency within the sentence.	Only Churchill recalled/remembered that he gave the Blood, Sweat and Tears speech.
0	Syntax	The error in this sentence lies in subject-verb agreement. In the present tense, a singular third person subject requires an 's' on the verb (e.g., he promises). However, here we have two singular nouns as subjects - John and Mary, connected by 'and'. When there are multiple singular nouns acting as joint subjects, no s is required for the verb if they are both performing the action together. But when the second noun is used only as the indirect object, it does not affect the conjugation of the verb. Therefore, the correct form should be "John promises Mary to shave himself".	John promises Mary to shave himself.
1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically correct because it follows the rules for word order and structure in English. The subject of the sentence is "John", who is performing the action of convincing. "Bill" is the indirect object, receiving the direct object "that Mary should sleep". This is a grammatically valid way to construct a sentence expressing persuasion.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a pronoun "so" that does not have an antecedent, making it unclear what action the speaker is referring to. Additionally, there is no punctuation between the two independent clauses, leading to a run-on sentence error.	The corrected sentence could be either of the following: 1. "I saw Bill while you did; meanwhile, Mary..." 2. "While I saw Bill, you did something, and Mary..."
0	Syntax	The subject-verb agreement rule has been violated here. In this case, both "Mary" and "Bill" are being referred to by the verb "was". However, since "Bill" is singular, the verb should be "was", but if we use "were", it would agree with "Mary", so there's no way to make both subjects agree with the same verb form. To fix this issue, we need to rephrase the sentence to clarify who performed the action. One possible solution could be: "What Mary saw was Bill giving a book."	The sentence I provided earlier cannot be corrected as written due to the subject-verb agreement issue explained above; therefore, the following correction can be made instead: "What Mary saw was Bill giving a book."
0	Syntax	In English, a verb usually needs a subject. However, the sentence "The bears sniffed" does not have a main verb in the present tense, so it's unclear what action the bears are performing now. A more complete version could be "The bears sniff," meaning they have the ability to smell, but without additional context it's difficult to say for sure whether that's the intended meaning.	The sentence may need more information depending on its intended meaning. For example, "The bears are sniffing around for food" would be grammatically correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct, as it follows standard subject-verb-object word order and has a clear meaning.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The verb "demonize" requires a direct object to complete its meaning, but none is provided in the sentence. A corrected version could be "Anson demonized the protestors," assuming that Anson had a negative view of the protestors' actions.	Anson demonized the protestors.
0	Syntax	The verb "kick" requires a singular object when used reflexively ("yourself," not "yourselves"). Therefore, the plural form "yourselves" does not agree with the singular subject "you." A correction would be necessary to maintain number agreement between the subject and the object.	The sentence should read as follows: "You kicked yourself."
0	Syntax	This sentence contains a misplaced relative clause. A relative clause should be immediately after the noun it modifies. In this case, the relative clause "that I'd never read" is incorrectly placed after "I said," instead of right after "book." Here is the corrected version of the sentence:	The book that I'd never read, I said.
0	Syntax	The verb "demonize" requires a direct object to complete its meaning, but there is no direct object in this sentence. Additionally, the adverb "up" does not fit grammatically in this context. A more appropriate way to construct this sentence would be "Anson demonized the Khyber Pass."	Anson demonized the Khyber Pass.
0	Syntax	The negation "not" is incorrectly placed in relation to the verb phrase "might be going". A correct way to express a negative intention would be "I might not be going to the party", implying uncertainty about attending; or "I am not going to the party", indicating a firm decision not to attend.	I might not be going to the party.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a subject-verb agreement error. In the present tense, the verb "kick" requires a singular subject when used as an imperative ("Kick the ball!"), but it requires a plural subject otherwise ("You kick me"). Here, there is no clear plural subject for the verb "kick," so we assume it's intended as an imperative, making "you" the implied subject. However, since "you" isn't explicitly stated before the verb, a more appropriate form would be "Kick me!" instead.	The sentence should be "Kick me!" if the intent is to use an imperative form. Otherwise, a proper subject needs to precede the verb "kick."
1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically correct because it follows the rules for word order and structure in English. It contains a subject ("Jason"), a verb ("persuaded"), and an object ("the doctor"). Additionally, there is a dependent clause beginning with "to" followed by the infinitive form of the verb "treat," which modifies the main clause.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The subject of the sentence is missing, so it's unclear who performed the action described by the verb "get". A corrected version could be: "You got an accurate description of whom?" or "Who did you accurately describe?"	The sentence is not currently correct. It should read: "Whom did you give an accurate description of?"
1	Syntax	In this sentence, there is no clear syntactic error that would cause it to be incorrect. All elements have a clear role within the structure of the sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	This sentence is syntactically incomplete as it lacks a main verb. It seems like there might be a missing verb such as "is" after "government". A complete sentence requires both a subject ("the government") and a predicate (a verb plus any accompanying objects, complements, etc.). In its current form, the sentence does not have a predicate, making it grammatically incorrect.	The sentence should read either "The government imposes a fine," or more specifically, "The government's imposition of a fine is..." depending on context.
0	None	The sentence is already correct. It has proper syntax, semantics, and morphological structure.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically correct as it follows the rules for word order and structure in English. The subject of the sentence is "you," followed by the auxiliary verb "wanted," and the object is "to meet the man I saw."	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence "Anson demonized David every day" is grammatically incorrect because it lacks a necessary determiner before the noun "day". A more appropriate way to phrase the sentence would be "Anson demonized David every day." or "Anson demonized David each day.", where the word "each" functions as a determiner for the noun "day".	Anson demonized David every day.
0	Syntax	The word "programme" should be spelled as "program," without the extra 'e' at the end. In American English, it is spelt "program", while in British English both spellings are acceptable but "program" is more commonly used in technical contexts such as computer programming. However, using "a" before words starting with an unstressed vowel sound requires the use of "an". Therefore, the correct form would be "There is a program about Euripides on Radio 4 tonight?"	The corrected sentence is: "There is a program about Euripides on Radio 4 tonight?"
1	Syntax	The sentence "Medea denied poisoning the phoenix" is grammatically correct. It follows standard English syntax rules for word order and structure.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically correct because it follows the rules for forming phrases and clauses in English. It has a subject ("the elixir"), a verb ("was hidden"), and an object complement ("in a hole in the ground") that describes the location where the elixir was hidden. The word order is appropriate, and there are no grammatical errors such as subject-verb agreement or incorrect use of tense.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence is missing a preposition between "danced" and "Trade". A more appropriate way to construct this sentence would be "Extremely frantantly, Anson danced at the trade show" or some other specific location where Anson was dancing.	Extremely frantically, Anson danced at the trade show.
0	Syntax	The question is syntactically incorrect because it uses the wrong verb form "did" after "what". Additionally, there's a missing direct object for the verb "ask". A correct version could be "What did you ask Medea about?" or "What did you ask Medea to give?".	What did you ask Medea about?
1	Syntax	The sentence "It's Anson that I like" is grammatically correct. The subject-auxiliary inversion ("It's") indicates a question expectancy but can be used for emphasis or contrast. In this case, it emphasizes who the speaker likes.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The verb "tried" requires a direct object to complete its meaning, but the word "nurse" has been used incorrectly as the direct object instead of being used as the subject of the infinitive "to poison". A more grammatically correct way to express this idea would be "Medea attempted to have the nurse poison her children" or "Medea tried poisoning her children through the nurse."	Medea tried to poison her children using the nurse.
0	Syntax	The verb tense used in each clause of a complex sentence must be consistent. In the original sentence, "I felt" is past tense while "know" is present tense, creating inconsistency. A more grammatically correct version would use either both verbs in past tense ("I felt that I knew you") or both verbs in present perfect tense ("I feel that I have known you").	The corrected version using past tense would be "I felt that I knew you," indicating that the speaker had a certain feeling about their relationship with the listener in the past.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a double subject ("he" and "can"), which results in incorrect syntax. In English, we cannot use two subjects together without using conjunctions such as "and," "or," etc. To make the sentence grammatically correct, we need to remove either "will" or "can". Here's how it would work: * Corrected version 1: "Will he be able to do it?" OR * Corrected version 2: "Can he do it?" Therefore, I will choose option 2 because removing "will" makes for shorter, more direct language, making it preferable unless there's a specific reason to emphasize future tense.	Can he do it?
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a subject-verb agreement error. In the first clause "I ate", the verb "ate" does not match the subject "I". A more appropriate verb would be "saw" or "noticed". Additionally, there is no main verb in the second clause "that she was happy". It appears to be subordinate clause without a main clause to connect it to.	I noticed that she was happy.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Anson believed himself to be handsome" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules for syntax in English. Specifically, the subject ("Anson") is followed by a verb ("believed"), and then there is a clause ("himself to be handsome") that functions as the direct object of the verb. This type of construction is called a complex transitive sentence, where the direct object is a clause rather than just a noun or pronoun.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "We arrived about six o'clock" is grammatically correct. The subject "we" agrees with the verb "arrived," and the prepositional phrase "about six o'clock" correctly modifies when the action took place.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The verb tense in this sentence is incorrect. "Gilgamesh is having fought" is a present perfect progressive tense used to describe an action that started in the past and continues up until now. However, since it says "has fought," it implies that the action has been completed, so using the present perfect simple tense would be more appropriate. Additionally, there's no need for both "is" and "having" - only one auxiliary verb is necessary.	"Gilgamesh has fought the dragon."
0	Syntax	The reflexive pronoun "himself" cannot be used as a subject; it must refer back to another noun or pronoun within the same clause. In this case, "Anson" is the subject of the sentence, so we need to use the non-reflexive form "he": "Anson thought he was happy."	Anson thought he was happy.
1	Semantics	The sentence "Fortunately Hermione passed biology" is grammatically correct but semantically it would be more clear if it said what exactly she passed such as an exam or class. A better way to write it could be "Fortunately, Hermione passed her biology exam" or "Fortunately, Hermione passed biology class". However, based on the information provided in the original sentence, I will assume it is a correct sentence since we don't have enough context about what she passed in biology.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a coordinating conjunction ("but") linking two verb phrases instead of independent clauses, making it a sentence fragment rather than a complete sentence. A coordinate structure requires both elements on either side of the conjunction to be grammatically equivalent. Here, we need two full clauses for the construction to work correctly; e.g., "I might not go to the party, but I will wash my hair" would be grammatically sound. In its current form, however, the second part lacks a finite verb, causing the syntax error.	The corrected version could be as follows: "I might not be going to the party but am washing my hair instead."
0	Syntax	The reflexive pronoun used here should be "himself" instead of "myself". In this context, "he" is referring to a single male person, so using "myself", which refers back to the speaker ("I"), results in incorrect syntax because it implies two separate people are involved.	The sentence corrected would be "I thought he liked himself."
1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically well-formed because it follows the standard subject-verb-object word order in English, and all elements have a clear grammatical role within the structure.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	This sentence contains multiple instances of infinitive verb forms ("to appear" and "to seem") being modified by adverb phrases ("happens to" and "to be"), which results in awkward phrasing and unclear meaning. It can be revised for clarity and grammaticality as follows: "Jason appears to seem sick," although it would still be more clear to say "Jason seems sick."	The sentence is already correct if rephrased as "Jason seems sick."
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a misplaced relative pronoun "who". In order for the sentence to be grammatically correct, it needs to specify what or who you asked first before using the word "who" later on in the question. Here's an example of how the sentence could be corrected: "Who did you ask what they saw?"	Who did you ask what they saw?
1	Syntax	The sentence "We linguists love to argue" is grammatically correct. It follows the standard subject-verb-object word order in English, where "we" is the subject, "love" is the verb, and "to argue" is the object. Additionally, there are no apparent morphological errors such as incorrect tense usage, spelling errors, or missing punctuation marks.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence "He can will go" is grammatically incorrect because it contains a redundancy error. The modal verb "can" already implies ability, so there's no need to use "will," which expresses future tense. Therefore, the correct form would be either "He can go" or "He will go," but not both together.	The sentence should be "He can go" or "He will go", depending on the intended meaning.
0	Syntax	The sentence is missing a required auxiliary verb, either "is" or "was", after "how". A proper question would be "How fierce was the battle?" or "How fierce is the battle?" if referring to something currently happening.	How fierce was the battle?
0	Syntax	The question contains a syntactic error known as a "misplaced wh-word." In this case, "which" has been misplaced; it should be next to its associated noun ("king") rather than being separated from it by another wh-word ("which"). A corrected version might read, "Which king did you ask about which city they had invaded?"	Which king did you ask about which city they had invaded?
0	Syntax	The subject of the sentence "it" does not make sense without additional context provided. Additionally, there is a missing article before "disgruntled old pigs". A more appropriate way to structure the sentence would be: "Those are some disgruntled old pigs in the ditches that humans love to eat."	Those are some disgruntled old pigs in the ditches that humans love to eat.
0	Syntax	In the sentence "That banana is eating the monkey," the subject ("that banana") is incorrect because only animate objects can eat. The verb "is eating" requires an actor who can perform the action. Therefore, it's a syntax error as the sentence violates grammatical rules.	The monkey is eating that banana.
0	Semantics	The sentence "Burn them!" is grammatically correct but it lacks context, making its meaning ambiguous. It could be a command to burn something, but without additional information it's impossible to say for certain what the intended meaning is. Therefore, I cannot confirm if the sentence is semantically correct or not.	The sentence requires more context to determine if it is correct or not.
0	Other Category	The word "omnipotent" means all-powerful, so it implies that a being has immense power and control over everything. However, describing a mythical figure such as Aphrodite as "stinking" is informal and disrespectful. Therefore, the combination of these two words creates a mismatch in tone and register.	It's unfortunate that Aphrodite is omnipotent.
1	Semantics	The sentence "Agamemnon seems to be a maniac" is grammatically correct but its meaning is ambiguous without additional context. The word "maniac" can have different meanings such as someone who is extremely enthusiastic about something or a mentally ill person who behaves violently. Therefore, it's unclear what specific meaning is intended here. However, since there is no clear grammatical error, I will assume that the sentence is semantically acceptable in some context.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Will Anson come to the party?" is grammatically correct. It follows the standard structure of a question in English, where the auxiliary verb "will" comes before the subject "Anson".	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "I wondered who Medea had poisoned" is grammatically correct. It follows the standard structure for a question in English, where the auxiliary verb ("had") comes before the subject ("Medea"). This type of word order is called inverted word order and it's used to form questions in English.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The subject-auxiliary inversion needed for a question has been applied incorrectly. It should be "Could I inquire when we can leave?" instead. In the original sentence, it seems as though "I" is the object being inquired about rather than the person doing the inquiring.	Could I inquire when we can leave?
0	Syntax	The sentence is missing a direct object, which makes it grammatically incomplete. In this case, we don't know who or what they kicked. A complete sentence requires a subject, verb, and object. Here, "they" is the subject, "kicked" is the verb, but there is no object. For example, a possible correction could be "They kicked the ball."	The sentence needs a direct object to be grammatically complete. For instance, "They kicked the ball."
0	Syntax	In the present tense, the base form of a verb is used after "is" or "are". Therefore, the past tense "ate" should be changed to the base form "eat".	The monkey is eating the banana.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a grammatical error known as a verb tense agreement error. In this case, the subject ("I") does not agree in number and tense with its corresponding verb ("could"). A correct formulation of this sentence would be either "I would like to can swim" or "I would have liked to swim," depending on what meaning is intended. However, both options sound awkward and unnatural; it may be best to rephrase the entire sentence for clarity and fluency.	It might be better to say something like "I wish I could swim" instead.
0	Syntax	The sentence "I kicked myself" is grammatically correct but its meaning can be ambiguous without additional context. It could mean that the speaker physically kicked themselves or it could be a figurative expression used to indicate self-reproach or regret. In writing, such ambiguity may lead to confusion for the reader. To avoid this, adding more words to clarify the intended meaning would be helpful. For example, "I literally kicked myself" or "I kicked myself metaphorically".	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	In the sentence "The bookcase ran", there is a subject-verb agreement error. The subject "bookcase" is singular, but the verb "ran" is plural. The correct form of the verb for a singular noun is "ran" or "runs". Therefore, the correct sentence would be "The bookcase runs."	The sentence should be "The bookcase runs."
0	Syntax	The sentence "I shaved myself" is grammatically correct. It consists of a single independent clause with a proper subject-verb agreement ("I" as the subject and "shaved" as the verb), and it follows standard English word order (Subject-Verb-Object). Moreover, the reflexive pronoun "myself" correctly refers back to the subject of the sentence, ensuring coreference between them.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Morphology	The word "musclebound" needs to be one word instead of two words. Additionally, articles such as "a" need to precede nouns, so it would have to be "a musclebound person," but since we're talking about Anson becoming something, we could say "Anson became muscular."	Anson became muscular.
