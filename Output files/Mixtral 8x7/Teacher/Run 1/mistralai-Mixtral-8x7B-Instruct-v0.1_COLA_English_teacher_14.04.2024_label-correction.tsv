1	The sentence is already correct.
0	The weight of the weights made the rope stretch over the pulley. Explanation: I changed "weights" to "the weight of the weights" because it's more grammatically correct. In its original form, "weights" functions as a plural noun but lacks an accompanying verb. Adding "the weight of" before "weights" makes it clear that we are referring to the collective weight of multiple objects rather than using "weights" as a standalone subject.
1	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence as it is written does not make sense. A possible correction could be: "Since you eat the most, you seem to want the least."
0	The fewer things you desire, the less you will eat. Explanation: The original sentence contains a grammatical error known as mixed construction. It starts off using comparative language ("the more... the less") but then switches to superlative language ("you would want"). This inconsistency makes it difficult for readers to understand the intended meaning of the sentence. By changing it to use consistent comparative language throughout, we can make the sentence clearer and grammatically correct.
0	The sentence should be "The more John eats, the more he has to pay."
1	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is already correct.
0	The more Bill smokes, the more Susan hates him. Comment: In your original sentence, "more" is used incorrectly before a verb ("smoke"). It's actually unnecessary; it would be grammatically correct to say simply "The more Bill smokes..." without using "more" again until after the comma. However, since including "more" doesn't change the meaning of the sentence significantly, I won't make any changes there.
1	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is already correct.
0	John visits Sally because he likes her. Explanation: The original sentence had a couple of issues. It used "does" instead of "visits," which caused verb tense disagreement between "who" and "likes." Additionally, it lacked specifying who John likes, so I added "her" to clarify that John likes Sally.
1	The sentence is already correct. Explanation: The sentence "Marianne did not leave" is grammatically correct.
0	He could not have been working.* (This sentence might be grammatically correct depending on context, but it often implies that the speaker is surprised about something they thought would happen but did not.) A more neutral formulation of a negative past habitual action would be: "He must not have been working."
0	The sentence should be "He could not have been working." instead of "He can not have been working." because "could" is used to express past ability or possibility, while "can" is used for present ability or possibility.
5	The sentence is already correct. Confidence: 95%
1	The sentence is already correct. Explanation: The sentence "John has not kissed Mary" follows proper grammatical rules for subject-verb agreement, verb tense consistency, word order, and spelling.
1	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence should be "Mickey looked up **it**s position" or something similar that makes sense in context. The reason for the correction is that we need a clear object of the verb "looked up". In your original sentence, "up" functions as an adverb modifying how Mickey looked, but there's no obvious direct object to complete the meaning.
0	The sentence should be "There tended to BE a lot of discussion." Since there is no verb "be" after "there", it makes the sentence incorrect grammatically.
1	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is already correct. Explanation: I will provide a brief explanation for my response to demonstrate my knowledge of English and linguistics. In this case, the sentence "John is eager" is grammatically correct as it follows standard English syntax rules by having a subject ("John") and a verb ("is eager"). Additionally, the form of the verb agrees with the third-person singular subject, making the sentence structurally sound.
1	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence should be "The tube was **escaped FROM** gas" or "The tube was filled with **escaped** gas".
1	The sentence is already correct. The sentence "Water bubbled up out of the kettle" is grammatically correct.
1	The sentence is already correct.
0	The water filled the bottle. Explanation: A more natural way of expressing what happened would be using the past tense form "filled" instead of "fill". Additionally, there's no need for a relative clause ("what the water did") as the subject ("the water") can directly take the action verb ("filled").
0	The water filled the whole bottle. Explanation: In this corrected version of the sentence, I have changed the passive voice ("was fill") to active voice ("filled"), which makes for clearer writing. Additionally, I removed the word "the" before "whole," as including it implies that there is more than one bottle being discussed. However, since only a single bottle is mentioned elsewhere in the sentence, we can assume that the writer intended to refer to just one bottle.
0	The sentence should be "The tank leaked the fluid freely," instead of "The tank leaked the fluid free."
0	The verb "lay" requires a direct object. A better choice here would be the past tense of "lie," which does not require a direct object. So the corrected sentence is "John laid **on** the bed" or "John put the ball in the box".
1	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is already correct. Explanation: This sentence is grammatically correct as it stands. It shows that two separate actions were taken towards different people - one of encouragement (to leave), directed at Mary, and another of dissuasion (to stay), directed at Sue. Each infinitive verb has its own subject, so no commas need to be added between them.
0	The sentence is not correct. Here is a corrected version: "Most people probably considered, even though the courts did not actually find him guilty, Klaus to be guilty of murder."
1	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence is not correct. Here's a corrected version: "Clearly, John will probably learn French perfectly immediately." The word 'immediately' needs to be placed after 'perfectly.'
0	The sentence should be "Sue gave Bill a book," without the word "to". In English, we don't typically include prepositions when describing direct objects of verbs like "give", so the indirect object ("Bill") comes before the direct object ("a book").
1	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is already correct. (Explanation: The sentence "John went home" is grammatically correct.)
0	They took it very seriously when presenting Mary, who is a genuine linguist, to the dean. Explanation: The original sentence has multiple issues. It might be trying to say that they presented a serious matter regarding Mary's skills as a linguist to the dean, but the wording is incorrect. To fix the issue, I changed "represented" to "presenting," added "it" after "seriously," moved "Mary, who is a genuine linguist" next to "them," and replaced "as" with "to."
0	The sentence should be "They love us."
1	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is already correct. Explanation: This sentence is grammatically correct and conveys a clear meaning. It uses the past perfect tense ("had kissed") to indicate that the action of kissing happened before another past action.
0	I can't believe Fred won't either. Explanation: The coordinating conjunction 'either' needs to be preceded by a comma when used in this way.
0	The sentence should be "John wants to read Fred's story, and I do too."
0	We wanted to invite someone, but we couldn't decide whom to invite.
1	The sentence is already correct.
0	Mary claimed that Holly shouldn't be eating cabbage.
0	The sentence should be "I also came." instead of "I also came to be." The verb "come" does not need a helping verb here.
1	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence should be "Joe's neuroses bother his patients, and Sally does too." if we assume that "neuroses" refers to a mental health condition affecting some of Joe's customers (patrons), which bothers them, and Sally has a similar effect on people.
0	I know which book José didn’t read for class, and which book Lily read for him. Explanation: The pronoun "he" must agree in number with its antecedent. In this case, "Lilly" is singular, so we need to use "she," not "it," as the pronoun.
0	The corrected sentence is: "This is the book which Bob reviewed, and this is the one that Fred won't do."
0	I know which book Mag read and which book Bob said you hadn't. Explanation: The conjunction "and" connects two independent clauses without a comma separating them. This results in a run-on sentence. It would be better to separate these into two sentences or use a semicolon instead of a comma.
0	I know which book Mag read and which book Bob read, but I haven't seen your report yet. Explanation: The original sentence contains multiple errors. There should be a conjunction ("and") connecting the two independent clauses instead of just a comma. Also, it would make more sense to include "but" before mentioning the report. Finally, there is no need for possessive pronouns such as "'my'" after "report," since the subject ("I") has already been established earlier in the sentence.
1	The sentence is already correct.
0	Rusty talked about himself only after Mary had talked about him.
0	The sentence should be "Fred talked about everything before Rusty did talk about something." to be grammatically correct. However, it would sound better if we removed the second instance of "talked" so that it reads "Fred talked about everything before Rusty did." Therefore, I will provide the corrected version as follows: The sentence is already correct: Fred talked about everything before Rusty did.
1	The sentence is already correct. (Explanation: I am an assistant designed to provide explanations when needed, so here's why the sentence is correct: "John often meets Mary" is grammatically correct and makes sense. It follows standard subject-verb-object order and uses appropriate verb tense.)
0	The problem is perceived easily.
1	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence should be "We elected him" or "We elected her", since "me" cannot be the subject of a sentence.
0	Which report did John submit that indicated his incompetence? Explanation: The original sentence contains a few errors. It uses the passive voice ("was submitted") which makes it wordy and less clear. Additionally, "that" after "he submit" is unnecessary because there's no clause following it. Instead, I replaced "incompetent" with "his incompetence," making the meaning of the sentence more explicit and easier to understand.
1	The sentence is already correct. Explanation: The sentence "Mary has always preferred lemos to lims." contains spelling errors that make it incorrect. The corrected sentence "Mary has always preferred lemons to limes." does not have any grammatical or spelling errors and is therefore grammatically correct.
0	The sentence should be "He let the cats that were whining out." or "He let the whining cats out.", as "which" implies a non-essential clause and requires a comma, while "that" introduces an essential clause without commas. Additionally, it's more common to use "the whining cats" instead of separating "cats" and "whining".
1	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is already correct.
0	The proof that the claim had been made was provided by the fact that John had lied.
0	He attributed the fire that destroyed most of my factory to a short circuit, which was caused by an overloaded transducer. Explanation: The clause "which was caused by an overloaded transducer" provides additional information about the short circuit, so it should be set off by a pair of commas to show that it's nonessential to the meaning of the sentence. Additionally, I added a comma after "factory" for clarity.
0	The mayor regarded as absurd the proposal to build a sidewalk from Dartmouth to Smith. Explanation: In this case, there is no need for "as" before "being". It can be simply written as "The mayor regarded absurd the proposal..." but it would still sound informal. So, I recommend using "as" after "regarded", making it clear that what follows next describes how the mayor regarded the proposal.
0	The sentence should be "Bill left so as to keep it a secret," or "Bill left in order for it to remain a secret." The original sentence is grammatically incorrect because "to" cannot follow another infinitive without a conjunction such as "in order" or "so as".
0	I know a man whom Tom drives. OR The sentence is already correct if it's intended to be: I know a man who drives as he does.
0	Drowning cats, which is against the law, are difficult to rescue.
1	The sentence is already correct.
0	Rutherford understands himself. Explanation: In the original sentence, 'Himself' is used incorrectly as a subject complement. The reflexive pronoun 'himself' refers back to the subject of the sentence, which here is 'Rutherford'. However, it cannot be used as the direct object of the verb 'understood', so we need to rephrase the sentence accordingly.
1	The sentence is already correct.
0	The proof that this set is recursive is challenging. Explanation: In the original sentence, "difficult" should be replaced by "challenging". Additionally, there is a missing article before "set", which I have added for proper grammar.
0	The madrigals that Henry plays the lute and sings sound loud. Explanation: In the original sentence, there is a misuse of the word "lousy". It would be more appropriate to use a word such as "poorly" or "badly" instead if describing the quality of the music. Additionally, it may be clearer to say "the madrigals that Henry plays on the lute and sings" rather than just "plays the lute and sings", although both forms are grammatically correct.
1	The sentence is already correct.
0	You need to specify the subjects of the two clauses in your question. A possible correction could be: "Where did you go and what did he eat?" Or it could be: "Where have you been and what did you eat?" The original sentence is grammatically incorrect because it lacks clear subject-verb agreement for each clause.
0	Whose boy'sdid we elect as the guardian's employer's president? Explanation: The original sentence contains multiple errors. Here is a breakdown of the corrections made: * Added "as" before "the" to indicate that someone was elected to become something. * Changed "whose boy's" to "Whose boy's" for proper capitalization. However, it would be better to rephrase the question entirely. Instead of asking whose boy was elected, it might make more sense to ask who was elected as the guardian's employer's president. This way, there is no ambiguity about what position the person holds.
0	A more grammatically correct way to ask this question would be "How sanely does Peter behave?" or "How mentally sound is Peter?" The original sentence, "How sane is Peter?" is understandable but informal for written English. In spoken language, it's common and acceptable.
1	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence should be "The sentence is almost correct; however, 'it' should be replaced with 'there' to correctly refer back to the place mentioned earlier in the sentence. So the corrected version is: 'I live at the place where Route 150 crosses the Hudson River and my dad lives there too.'"
0	Who is she trying to make up to now? The given sentence is grammatically correct but makes little sense without additional context. The word "make up" can have multiple meanings; however, none of them seem appropriate here without further information about the situation being referred to. It might be better rephrased for clarity if used in a different way depending on what it's intended meaning is supposed to be. Nonetheless, as far as grammaticality goes, there isn't anything wrong with the structure of the question itself.
0	The sentence has several errors. A corrected version would be: "Wind had got **get**ten off a plot to negotiate an honorable end to the war in Vietnam." However, even this revised sentence may still sound stilted or archaic to modern ears; it might be more natural to say something like "Someone had uncovered a plot to negotiate an honorable end to the war in Vietnam" instead.
0	The correct sentence is "Mike talked about politics to my friends yesterday." In English, when mentioning who a conversation was directed towards, that information typically comes after any verbs of speaking, without using "to" before it.
0	The sentence should be "It was expected of the reporters that the principal would fire some teachers." The plural form "teachers" is needed because more than one teacher may be fired. Additionally, "it was expected by the reporters" should be changed to "it was expected of the reporters," as it is the reporters' expectations that are being referred to.
0	The sentence should be "Which hat did Mike quip he never wore?" if the person referred to as "she" is supposed to be the same as "Mike". Otherwise, it would need additional context for me to provide a corrected version of the sentence.
0	Which girl did Mike say never wore this hat? Explanation: The verb "quip" means to make a quick, clever remark. Here, it seems that what's intended is something closer to "ask," which would be better expressed as "say."
1	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence should be "I won't have any money" instead of "I won't have some money".
0	The sentence contains a grammatical error. A more appropriate way to phrase it would be: "Do you believe the claim that someone was looking for something?"
0	The sentence is not correct. Here is a corrected version: "I would not ask you to believe that he tried to force me to give her any money." Explanation: In the original sentence, "I won't" does not make sense because it implies a refusal of something that has not been asked for yet. Instead, using "would not" conveys a hypothetical situation that did not actually happen. Additionally, the verb tense after "believe" needs to be consistent, so "tried" should also be changed to "try".
0	The sentence should be "That Sam sometimes doesn't sleep must have pleased somebody." Instead of "didn't," we need to use "doesn't" because it refers to a habitual action that occasionally happens in the present time.
0	The sentence should be "I talked to Winston about him." if the intended meaning is that the speaker discussed Winston as a separate individual from themselves. However, if the intended meaning is that the speaker discussed Winston's thoughts or feelings, then the original sentence could be used, but it would still be more commonly expressed as "I talked to Winston about himself."
0	The fuzz wanting to arrest him worried John, but the fuzz not wanting to arrest her did not worry Mary. Explanation: I changed "that" to "the fuzz wanting to" for parallelism between the two clauses. Also, changed "wanted her" to "not wanting to arrest her" to maintain consistency in verb tense and meaning.
0	The sentence should read, "I'll work on it if Sam is willing to work on it." instead of "I'll work on it if Sam will be working on it." because we use the present tense ("is") after "if" for future actions, rather than the future continuous tense ("will be").
0	The sentence is already correct. I will work on it if I can. Explanation: In your original statement, there seems to be a typo where the subject-verb agreement is incorrect. Instead of saying 'I'll', which implies that the speaker is going to do something, consider using 'I will'. This way, the verb form matches the number of the subject, making the sentence grammatically correct.
0	Here's a knife for you to cut up the onions with. Explanation: The preposition "with" should come after the verb it modifies ("cut") rather than before it.
0	The sentence should be "Fluffy is sick, which not everyone knows." instead.
0	The correct form of the sentence would be "Maxwell is quite a good doctor" or simply "Maxwell is a very good doctor," since one cannot merely be "quite a" doctor without any qualification.
0	The younger woman might have been tall and the older one definitely was blond. Explanation: There is a superfluous comma after "tall" that needs to be removed.
0	The correct sentence is: "Sally is tall and may be blonde, and Sheila is short and definitely is blonde." (Note that I changed "blond" to "blonde" for gender consistency.)
0	I have to try to finish grading some paperss. (should be "papers" without the extra 's')
0	The socks are ready for you to put on; they are not yet planned.
1	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence should be "This violin is difficult to play sonatas on because it is difficult to produce the necessary sound quality and precision." OR "It is difficult to play sonatas on this violin due to its poor sound quality and lack of precision." The original sentence implies that sonatas themselves are difficult to put on the violin, rather than acknowledging the difficulty of playing them well on the instrument.
0	The sentence should be "My mother is easy to please, even my father." The original sentence is missing a comma after "please" and needs additional words to complete its meaning.
0	The sentence should be "Poor Bill, it had begun to rain and he had no umbrella." as 'begun' is the past participle of 'begin'.
0	The fact that the cops spoke to the janitor about the robbery yesterday is terrible.
0	Every student who wears socks is a swinger. Explanation: In order for the sentence to be grammatically correct, it needs to use a relative pronoun such as "who" instead of a conjunction such as "and". Additionally, there should not be a comma separating "every student" from the rest of the clause if "who" is used.
1	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is already correct.
0	Everyone around here who ever buys anything on credit talks in their sleep. The original sentence contained a common error where "his" was used instead of the gender-neutral plural possessive pronoun "their".
0	I can't remember the name of someone who had misgivings. Explanation: The word "somebody" should be replaced with "someone" for grammatical correctness.
0	At least one pair of writers or playwrights must meet in Vienna for the sentence to be grammatically correct. For example: "At least one writer or playwright meets in Vienna."
0	No writer or playwright meets in Vienna. Explanation: The word "nor" should be replaced by "or", because we're connecting two subjects ("writer" and "playwright") that have similar meanings using "or". Additionally, there shouldn't be a comma after "No writer".
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct. A more appropriate way to phrase it would be: "It is not certain that you will marry any student."
0	The corrected sentence should be: "Felicia kicked the ball off the field." The original sentence states that she kicked the ball off a bench which doesn't make much sense as it would likely just roll away instead of being "kicked off" something.
1	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence should be "Sam took the ball out of the basket" as 'gave' implies that something was received by someone else.
0	Sam offered the ball from the basket. Explanation: The preposition used here needs to be 'from' rather than 'out of'. We use 'offer something from somewhere', not 'offer something out of somewhere.'
1	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is already correct.
0	Nobody can forgive that comment to you. Explanation: The subject here requires a singular verb, so we use "Nobody" instead of "No one".
1	The sentence is already correct. Explanation: There are no grammatical errors or awkward phrasings in the provided sentence. Additionally, all words are spelled correctly. Therefore, I would rate this sentence as grammatically correct.
1	The sentence is already correct. Explanation: I have checked the sentence carefully, and there are no grammatical errors or awkward phrasings that need correction. Therefore, the sentence can be labeled as grammatically correct.
0	I lent the book partially to Tony. Explanation: The word "partway" implies that something moved part of the way to a destination. In this context, it would be more appropriate to use the word "partially," which means to only a certain degree or extent.
1	The sentence is already correct.
0	The farmer tipped over the cart full of apples. Explanation: In the original sentence, we would typically say that the farmer "tips over" a cart rather than "dumps" it, as "dumping" implies getting rid of something entirely. Additionally, if we want to specify what's inside the cart, we use the construction "full of," not just "with."
0	The sentence should be "Martha carved a toy for the baby out of wood." The original sentence implies that the baby is made of wood, which is incorrect and nonsensical.
0	The bread cuts easily. (This sentence is actually grammatically correct.)
0	The sentence should be "Janet broke Bill's finger" as it indicates possession using "'s". Also, people can't be broken; body parts can.
1	The sentence is already correct.
5	The sentence is already correct. Confidence: 95%
0	The sentence "We pulled free" is grammatically incorrect as it lacks context for the action being performed. A more complete sentence would be necessary to determine if it's correct.
1	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence should be "Sharon came into the room."
1	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is already correct. Explanation: I am returning 1 because the given sentence "That acorn will grow into an oak tree" is grammatically correct. Therefore, my response to the request would be: "Label: 1 The sentence is already correct."
0	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is already correct. Explanation: The sentence "I mixed the sugar into the butter" is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("I"), a verb ("mixed") that agrees with the subject in number, and an object ("the sugar"). Additionally, it includes a prepositional phrase ("into the butter") that modifies the verb by telling us where the action took place. Therefore, there is no need to change anything about the sentence.
0	The sentence should be "Brian threw the stick over the fence," as it is not possible to throw a fence with a stick.
1	The sentence is already correct. Explanation: I have labeled the sentence as correct because it follows all of the standard rules of English grammar and syntax. There are no spelling errors, punctuation errors, word choice issues, subject-verb agreement problems, or other common errors that would warrant a correction. Therefore, the original sentence can be considered grammatically correct.
1	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is already correct. Explanation: The sentence "I sensed his eagerness" is grammatically correct as it follows standard subject-verb-object word order, uses a proper tense, and has appropriate punctuation.
1	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is already correct. Explanation: The original sentence "Sarah smiled a charming smile" is grammatically correct. It consists of two independent clauses ("Sarah smiled" and "a charming smile") connected by the conjunction "a," which functions as an article here. Both subjects and verbs agree in number, and there are no grammatical errors that would require correction.
1	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is already correct.
0	Books that are paperbacks can be easily lifted onto the table. Explanation: The original sentence contains a grammatical error. Instead of saying "lift onto," it should say "are lifted onto" or simply "can be placed on." Additionally, the subject of the sentence should come before the verb for proper parallel structure, so instead of "paperback books lift," it should say "books that are paperbacks can be easily lifted."
0	The books were lifted onto the table. Explanation: In present tense, we use 'are' for plural subjects. However, since there is a past action described here ('lifted'), it requires a form of the verb 'to be' that indicates past tense - either 'was' (singular subject) or 'were' (plural subject). Therefore, 'The books were lifted onto the table.' would be grammatically correct.
0	The sentence should be "Jessica loaded boxes onto the wagon," as we load things onto a wagon, not under it.
1	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence should be "Jessica was cramming boxes into the truck." instead of "Jressica crammed boxes at the truck."
0	The correct sentence is "Lora butterred the toast" - the verb "butter" requires an object to receive the action, so we cannot say "buttered at".
0	The sentence is already correct. User 2: I seen that movie yesterday. Label: 0 I have seen that movie yesterday. (Alternatively, "I saw that movie yesterday" would also be grammatically correct.)
0	The sentence is already correct. Confidence: 100%
0	The sentence is already correct. Confidence: 100%
1	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence should be "Carla slipped on the book," as "slid" requires a location or surface to slide along, which is missing in the original sentence. Additionally, there is no preposition indicating what Carla did to the book.
1	The sentence is already correct. Explanation: I have checked the sentence "Amanda carried the package to Pamela" thoroughly for any grammatical errors or awkward phrasings. It appears that the sentence follows standard English syntax rules and contains proper word usage, punctuation, and capitalization. Therefore, I can confirm that it's a grammatically correct sentence.
0	The sentence should be "Packages can be delivered easily to New York" or "It is easy for packages to be driven to New York".
1	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is already correct. Comment: This sentence is grammatically correct as it stands.
0	The sentence is not correct. The correct form should be "A job has been offered" or "A job offer has been made".
1	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is already correct. Explanation: The sentence "Carmen bought Mary a dress" is grammatically correct. It has a clear subject ("Carmen"), verb ("bought"), and object ("a dress"). Additionally, it follows standard English word order for a simple sentence (Subject-Verb-Object), making it easy to understand without any errors in grammar, spelling, punctuation, or syntax.
1	The sentence is already correct. Explanation: The original sentence is grammatically correct and well-constructed. No errors were found that need to be corrected.
1	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is already correct. Explanation: This sentence is grammatically correct as it stands. There is no need to make any changes.
1	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is already correct. Explanation: The sentence "Linda taped the picture onto the wall" follows proper English grammar rules and usage, so it can be considered a grammatically correct sentence.
1	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is already correct. Explanation: There are no grammatical errors in the sentence. The word "this" refers to something nearby or closer than "that," which is used for objects that are further away. Therefore, it's appropriate to use these words in the sentence to distinguish between two different flyers.
0	The two flyers differ from each other. OR The flyers differ in some respect. Explanation: In your original sentence, "differ apart" is redundant as "differ" alone implies a difference between two things without needing to specify "apart".
0	The sentence is not correct. The proper form of the sentence would be: "The jeweler scrawled his name on the contract."
0	An acorn grows into an oak tree; a gardener cultivates it.
1	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence is not correct. A plural subject needs a plural verb, so it should be "The children amuse" or better yet, add an object to complete the thought such as "The children amuse themselves".
1	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence should be "Susan whispered to Rachel."
1	The sentence is already correct. Explanation: The sentence "Ellen said that melons were selling well" follows all of the rules for standard written American English grammar and punctuation. It contains a subject ("Ellen"), a verb tense indicating past action ("said"), and a clause including another subject ("melons") and verb tense ("were selling"). Additionally, it uses appropriate capitalization and ending punctuation.
0	The sentence should be "Ellen commented on the current conditions" or "Ellen spoke about the current conditions". The original sentence lacks a clear object of discussion, so I added "current conditions" to make it grammatically complete.
1	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is already correct. Explanation: The sentence "Cynthia chewed" is grammatically correct as it contains a proper subject ("Cynthia") and verb ("chewed"). There are no spelling errors, punctuation issues, or other grammatical problems present in this sentence.
1	The sentence is already correct. Comment: This sentence is grammatically correct and does not contain any spelling errors. It clearly expresses that Paul found something amusing about Mary's behavior or appearance, which caused him to laugh. Therefore, there is no need to change anything in this sentence.
0	The sentence should be "Linda **winked her eye**" or **"flicked her lip"**. The original sentence is incorrect because people usually don't wink their lips - they might wink their eyes or flick their lips using a different verb.
0	The sentence should be "My heart is pounding" instead of "My heart is pounding me".
1	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence is already correct. Explanation: The original sentence is grammatically correct but I will still provide a complete sentence for consistency. No changes were made to the original sentence because it does not contain any errors.
1	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "squeak" requires a reflexive pronoun when used in the past tense to indicate that the subject caused the action. A better way to write the sentence would be "I squeezed **myself** through the doorway," or simply "I squeezed through the doorway." The original sentence "I squeaked the door" implies that the speaker made a high-pitched noise as they moved through the doorway, which might not have been their intention.
1	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is already correct.
0	The flag on the fort was fluttering with many others. Explanation: A single fort cannot flutter; only a flag can flutter. Therefore, I have corrected the original sentence to reflect that multiple flags were fluttering.
1	The sentence is already correct. Explanation: The sentence "The voices echoed in the hall" is grammatically correct as it follows all of the necessary rules for English syntax and word usage. Here's a breakdown of why this sentence works: * Subject ("voices") agrees with verb tense ("echoed"): Both the subject and verb agree in number and tense, which makes the sentence clear and easy to understand. * Proper use of preposition: In this case, "in" is used correctly to indicate that the voices were inside the hall. * Correct punctuation: There are no missing commas or other forms of punctuation, making the sentence flow smoothly without any interruptions.
1	The sentence is already correct. Explanation: I have labeled this sentence as correct because it follows all of the rules for standard written American English grammar and punctuation. It includes a subject ("the stream") and a verb ("twists"), which agrees in number with the subject. Additionally, there are no spelling errors, capitalization errors, or misplaced modifiers that would detract from its clarity or meaning.
0	A wonderful opportunity presented itself yesterday. Explanation: The adjective should come before the noun it modifies, so instead of saying "There presented himself a wonderful opportunity," say "A wonderful opportunity presented itself" to make the sentence grammatically correct.
1	The sentence is already correct.
0	The little white rabbit jumped out of the box.
1	The sentence is already correct. Explanation: The sentence "Penny skated around the rink" is grammatically correct as it follows standard subject-verb-object word order, uses a proper verb tense, and has appropriate prepositions to indicate location.
1	The sentence is already correct.
0	Much information was provided. Explanation: The word 'many' is used for countable nouns while 'much' is used for uncountable nouns. In this case, 'information' is an uncountable noun so we use 'much'.
0	The sentence should be "John offers much advice" or "John offers a lot of advice". The word "many" should be replaced with "much" or "a lot of", because "advice" is uncountable. Therefore, we use "much" instead of "many".
1	The sentence is already correct.
0	The recommended way to phrase this would be, "We recommend eating less cake and pastry."
1	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence should be "Wash **you**r hands" or "You wash your hands". The original sentence has incorrect subject-verb agreement and word order.
0	The sentence "They have no in" is not correct. A corrected version would be "They have nothing."
0	Some of my jobs are in jeopardy. Explanation: The word "some" should be followed by a form of the verb "to be," which in this case would be "are." Therefore, "Some my jobs" needs to be changed to "Some of my jobs."
0	The sentence should be "It was the policeman who met several young students in the park last night."
0	Did the police officer meet him in the park? Explanation: The word "policeman" should be replaced by "police officer" to use a more inclusive term that does not assume all police officers identify as male.
1	The sentence is already correct.
0	The monkeys are proud of their leader. (There needs to be a verb "are" before "proud".)
0	The sentence "John sounded very" is not correct. A suitable correction could be: "John sounded very good."
0	I don't know whether I should agree. Explanation: The word "if" needs to be replaced with "whether" when expressing uncertainty about a decision.
1	The sentence is already correct. Explanation: There are no grammatical errors or awkward phrasing in the sentence "John bought a book on the table". It contains a clear subject ("John"), a verb ("bought") that agrees with the subject, and an object ("a book on the table"). Additionally, the preposition "on" correctly describes the relationship between "the table" and "a book", indicating where the book is located. Therefore, there is no need to change anything in the sentence.
1	The sentence is already correct.

1	The sentence is already correct. This teacher is a genius. The grammar, spelling, and punctuation of this sentence are all correct.
0	The sentence should be "A good friend has remained loyal to me, thanks to him."
1	The sentence is already correct. Explanation: I will provide additional explanations for each response when necessary. In this case, the sentence "John ate his noodle quietly" appears to be grammatically correct as it follows standard subject-verb-object structure and uses appropriate verb tense and article usage.

0	The crocodile devoured the donut. Explanation: In American and British English, the spelling of the word for a small piece of sweet fried dough is typically "donut," without the "ugh" as it appears in "doughnut." Since there's no ambiguity about what food item is being referred to here, I assume that the intended meaning is "donut." Therefore, the original sentence contains a spelling error and needs correction.
1	The sentence is already correct. Explanation: The sentence "John is afraid of Bill" is grammatically correct. There are no spelling errors, punctuation errors, or grammatical errors that need to be corrected. Therefore, I would rate this sentence as 1 for being grammatically correct.
0	The sentence "John put under the bathtub" is incorrect. The correct version would be "John put something under the bathtub."
1	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence "Kim depends for Sandy" is not correct. It should be "Kim depends on Sandy."
1	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is already correct. Explanation: The original sentence, "John regards Bill as a good friend," is grammatically correct and well-constructed. It follows standard subject-verb-object word order, uses appropriate punctuation, and employs precise vocabulary to clearly convey its intended meaning. Thus, no corrections need to be made.
1	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is already correct. (Explanation: There are no grammatical errors in the provided sentence.)
1	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence should be "That Fred was unpopular caused Bill to be nominated."
1	The sentence is already correct. Explanation: The sentence is grammatically correct and the meaning is clear.
0	The sentence should be "John paid me for the book" instead of "John paid me against the book".
1	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence "We made them be rude" is grammatically incorrect. A more appropriate way to express this idea would be "We made them act rudely" or "We caused them to be rude".
1	The sentence is already correct. Explanation: The sentence "After reading the pamphlet, Judy threw it into the garbage can." is grammatically correct. It contains a main clause ("Judy threw it into the garbage can") that describes an action performed by the subject of the sentence after another event has occurred (reading the pamphlet), which is indicated using the conjunction "after". This creates clear meaning and logical flow for the reader. All punctuation, capitalization, spelling, and word choice are also appropriate. Therefore, I would rate this sentence as being completely correct.
0	The sentence should be either "Students who are studying English read Conrad's Heart of Darkness while at university" or "Students studying English read Conrad's Heart of Darkness at university".
0	The sentence should be "I have read some of the book" or simply "I read part of the book," as the present perfect tense ("have read") would typically be used to indicate that the action occurred at an unspecified time in the past. Alternatively, if you want to use the simple past tense, it's better to specify which part of the book you read by saying "I read part of the book."
0	The sentence should be "Much of the fruit is rotten," instead of "Most of the fruit is rotten" because we use much to talk about a large amount of uncountable things such as fruit when it's considered as a whole.
0	Neither of the students failed. Explanation: The word 'students' needs to be preceded by the definite article 'the'. This is because we are referring to specific students here.
0	The sentence should be "I drank some of the water."
0	The sentence should be "It is hair that is golden." or "It has golden hair.", as the original sentence incorrectly uses an adjective after a form of the verb "to be" instead of using a noun or pronoun.
1	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence is already correct. Dogs can sometimes try to bite themselves, especially if they have a wound or itch that they're trying to reach.
0	The sentence should be "He washed himself" changed to "He washed him." or "He washed himself" if it refers to washing his own body.
0	The correct sentence is "John is easy to please." or "John is easy to please Kim's tastes," if it is intended that Kim's tastes are what is being pleased. In its current form, the sentence implies that John himself is easy for someone named Kim to please.
0	The sentence seems to be incomplete. A correct version could be: "It seemed that there was intelligent life there."
1	The sentence is already correct. (Note: I am assuming that there are no other contextual errors related to pronouns, word choice, etc., as those can also impact grammaticality.)
0	The sentence is not correct. A revised version could be: "We believed John to be near the fountain in the park."
0	The sentence is not correct. The correct form should be: "It tries to **leaving** the country."
0	The sentence is already correct. Confidence: 100%
1	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence should be "There are believed to be **sheep** in the park" as 'sheep' takes a plural verb. Here, 'there' is used as a subject placeholder for impersonal verbs such as 'is', 'are'. However, it can also introduce a real subject which follows, so we need to make sure that our verb matches the actual subject. In your original sentence, 'is' does not match with the plural noun 'sheep'.
0	I hope to study in France. Explanation: The word 'would' needs to be removed from the original sentence because it creates a redundancy when used together with 'hope'. It makes the sentence grammatically incorrect. Instead, we can use 'will' for future tense, but here using just 'I hope to study in France' conveys the intended meaning clearly enough that no additional time marker is needed.
1	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence is not correct. The correct version of the sentence is "John will play in the rain tomorrow" or "It will rain tomorrow".
0	The expected sentence has a mistake. A more appropriate way to say it would be: "We expect that it will rain."
1	The sentence is already correct. Explanation: The sentence "John was found in the office" is grammatically correct.
0	Did the child stay in the school? OR Did the child being in the school be allowed? The original sentence needs to be revised as it uses incorrect verb tense.
1	The sentence is already correct. Explanation: The sentence "It did not rain" is grammatically correct as it follows standard English syntax rules for negating a verb tense using the auxiliary verb "did" followed by "not". The subject-verb agreement is also correct, making the overall structure of the sentence proper.
0	The sentence should be "John doesn't want to leave the town." instead of "John wants not to leave the town."
1	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence should be "They need not take this exam." Instead of "needn't," we use "need not" to express that it is not necessary for them to take the exam.
1	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is already correct. Explanation: The sentence does not contain any grammatical errors. It follows the subject-verb agreement rule and uses proper punctuation marks.
1	The sentence is already correct.
0	Scarcely as a statesman could he do anything worth mentioning. OR He could scarcely do anything worth mentioning as a statesman. The original sentence is incorrect because it uses "scarcely" incorrectly; instead of using "scarcely" to modify his ability as a statesman, it implies that being a statesman itself is difficult for him to do.
1	The sentence is already correct.

0	The sentence should be "A pound was weighed on the book" if the meaning is that a pound weight was used to weigh something while resting it on a book. However, the original sentence "A pound was weighed by the book" is grammatically incorrect because "weigh" requires a preposition such as "by" to refer to the agent performing the action only when the object being weighed is aware of or affected by the process of being weighed, which is unlikely for a book.
1	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence should be "Fed knows which politician he should vote for."
0	How did you guess that he had fixed the computer? The verb tense needs to be consistent throughout the sentence. The past perfect tense ("had fixed") should be used instead of simple past tense ("fixed") because it indicates that the action of fixing the computer occurred before another past action or time.
1	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence is almost correct, but it needs a question mark at the end to indicate that it's a question. So, the corrected sentence would be: "Which house does your friend live?"
1	The sentence is already correct.
0	The place where we can relax has been found by me. Explanation: In your original sentence, "I found the place where we can relax," it would be more grammatically correct to say "I have found" instead of just "found" because using the present perfect tense ("have found") implies that the action happened at an unspecified time before now. Additionally, moving the subject "I" to the beginning of the corrected sentence makes for a clearer and more natural sounding structure.
0	The sentence should be "Jack is the person **with** whom Jenny fell in love." So the corrected sentence is: "Jack is the person with whom Jenny fell in love."
1	The sentence is already correct. Explanation: The sentence "There is a bench to sit on" is grammatically correct as it follows standard subject-verb-object word order and uses proper prepositions.
1	The sentence is already correct.
0	You didn't get his approval before choosing which topic. (or alternatively, "Which topic did you choose without first getting his approval?") Explanation: The original sentence contains a minor error related to verb tense agreement. The past tense of the verb "get" should be used consistently throughout the sentence instead of switching to present perfect ("didn't get" vs. "hasn't gotten"). Additionally, I added the word "first" for clarity and better flow.
0	I got bored with the topic that Mary kept talking about. Explanation: The original sentence contains a few errors. A better way to express it would be: "I got bored with the topic that Mary kept talking about." This version uses the past tense verb form ("got") instead of the present perfect tense ("have gotten"), which doesn't seem necessary here. Additionally, we need to include the word "the" before "topic," since it refers to a specific one mentioned earlier. Finally, we use "that" as a relative pronoun to introduce the clause "Mary kept talking about," rather than just leaving off the beginning of the clause altogether.
1	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence is already correct. Explanation: The original sentence is grammatically correct but could be improved for clarity by specifying what about John's coughing bothers the speaker. For example: "It bothers me that John coughs so much" or "I am bothered by John's constant coughing". However, as it stands, the sentence is still technically correct from a grammatical standpoint.
0	It's easy to please John. Explanation: The original sentence contains a mistake known as a dangling modifier. In the corrected version, we use a passive construction ("is pleased") instead of trying to make "to please" into an infinitive verb that can take an object.
1	The sentence is already correct. Explanation: The sentence "Kim is eager to please Tom" is grammatically correct.
0	The fact that we invaded Iraq really bites. Explanation: The original sentence is incorrect because it uses "that" as a subject, which is grammatically wrong. A clause introduced by "that" must have a verb after it, so the corrected version includes the noun "fact".
0	The sentence should be "It annoys me that Fido barks." Since there is no apostrophe in "annoys," the verb form is incorrect.
0	The person who achieved the best result was Angela. Explanation: In formal English, we use "the person" instead of "who" to refer to people. Also, it's better to say "achieved the best results" if there were multiple achievements being evaluated. However, since the context is not provided, I assumed only one achievement was being referred to here.
1	The sentence is already correct.
0	It's difficult to find that type of person; no one can look after them. OR The sentence is already mostly correct - a better way to say it would be: "That kind of person is hard to find—anyone who could look after them."
0	A sick owl does not hunt mice.
0	Each candidate who is interested in semantics will be admitted to the department. Explanation: The word "has" should be changed to "is" because it sounds more natural and grammatically correct when used with the present participle form of the verb ("interested").
0	Each author whose contribution is written in any language other than English must provide a summary in English. Explanation: I changed "will" to "must" because there seems to be a requirement for non-English contributions to have summaries in English. Using "will" implies that it's optional or might happen in the future rather than being required now.
0	The sentence should be "I'm sure we have even gotten these tickets!" instead of "I'm sure we even got these tickets!". In present perfect tense, 'have' is used before a past participle to indicate that an action happened at an unspecified time before now.
0	I'm not even sure if we have gotten these tickets! Explanation: The word 'even' comes before 'sure', which implies a contradiction that is unnecessary here. Instead, use 'not even' to negate both words properly. Also, since it seems they haven't checked their possession of the ticket yet, using 'have gotten' would be more appropriate than 'got'.
1	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is already correct.
0	I gave Mary a book after the party. Explanation: The correct order of words in this sentence would be "subject + verb + indirect object + direct object + adverbial clause". In your original sentence, the word "after" has been misplaced as it separated the direct object ("a book") from its corresponding adverbial clause ("after the party").
0	The sentence should be "Because she's so pleasant, as for me, I really like her." instead of "Because she's so pleasant, as for Mary I really like her." because "as for" is followed by the speaker ("me") rather than the subject being discussed ("Mary").
1	The sentence is already correct.
0	With no job, John would not be happy.
0	The sentence should be "I have **much** of the manuscript left **to typed**." but instead it is "I have much of the manuscript left to type." So the corrected version is "I have much of the manuscript left to typed." However, since I cannot edit the original sentence, I will simply note that the correct form would use the past participle "typed" rather than the base form "type".
1	The sentence is already correct. Explanation: The sentence "He's a more reliable man" is grammatically correct as it follows standard English syntax rules for comparative forms of adjectives ("more") and subject-verb agreement.
0	The kind of trouble that I don't want is any trouble. Explanation: In your original sentence, "Any" modifies "trouble," so it needs to be placed before "trouble" for clarity and proper grammar usage. Also, adding "that" makes the sentence clearer.
1	The sentence is already correct.
0	Some of them made as many errors as twenty. Explanation: The number 'twenty' should be used instead of '20' in a formal written context.
0	The correct sentence is "Sally kissed herself" changed to "Sally kissed himselt." because "herself" should be replaced with "himself" since the subject of the sentence is "Sally".
0	The sentence should be "Drew believes that I think Rosie loves magazine ads." since a clause introduced by "that" is needed after "believes".
1	The sentence is already correct. Explanation: The sentence "Dave, Dan, Erin, Jaime, and Alina left" follows all of the rules for standard written American English grammar. Each word is spelled correctly, there is a clear subject ("Dave, Dan, Erin, Jaime, and Alina") and verb ("left"), and the sentence expresses a complete thought. Additionally, the names are capitalized properly and there are appropriate commas separating each name as well as before the conjunction "and". Overall, no corrections need to be made.
0	The sentence should be "I hope we'll make it through the winter without snow." The original sentence is missing a subject ("I").
0	The sentence should be "Blue leather shows that Betsy is pretty" or "Betsy's blue leather shows that she is pretty," as the subject of the sentence needs to agree with its verb.
1	The sentence is already correct.
0	I think you knew the answer. Explanation: The word "hit" is incorrect in this context. It seems that it was meant to be "think," which would make sense grammatically.
1	The sentence is already correct. This is a grammatically correct sentence known as a correlative construction, where two alternatives are connected by "or" or "nor".
1	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is already correct. Explanation: The sentence contains two simple independent clauses joined by a conjunction ("and"), which follows standard English grammar rules for constructing compound sentences. Each clause has a subject ("he") and verb ("likes" / "hates"). Additionally, there are no spelling errors or misused words in the provided sentence.
1	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence should be corrected as follows: "Reading the book of poems and reading something from Blackwell take a very long time." Alternatively, if only one thing is being read, it would be better to combine the two phrases into one action: "Reading the book of poems from Blackwell takes a very long time."
1	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence should be "The building's roof is leaking," instead of "The building's the roof is leaking."
0	The panther's coat is dark black.* The correct form would be "The panther's coat is **a** dark black," but "dark black" is redundant because "black" alone implies a very dark color. Therefore, the corrected sentence could also simply be "The panther's coat is black." *Note that I assumed you meant to say "the panther's coat," as it does not make sense for "panther" to modify "coat."
1	The sentence is already correct. (This sentence is grammatically correct.)
0	The man who I saw get into the cab robbed the bank. Explanation: When we use a relative pronoun such as 'who' to introduce a clause that describes a noun, we need to add a comma after the relative pronoun if it comes at the beginning of the clause. In your original sentence, since the relative pronoun 'who' introduces a clause that describes 'the man', adding a comma would make the sentence grammatically correct. Therefore, the corrected version is: "The man who I saw, get into the cab, robbed the bank."
1	The sentence is already correct.
5	The sentence is already correct. Confidence level: 95%
1	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence is already correct. Explanation: The sentence "Phillip gave the medal to the soldier" follows all of the necessary grammatical rules for a simple sentence in English, so it is grammatically correct as written.
0	Heidi thinks that Andy is going to eat salmon-flavored candy bars.
0	The sentence is already correct. The meaning of the sentence is clear and it follows the rules of standard English grammar and usage. However, it may sound strange to some people because salmon-flavored candy bars do not exist, as far as I know!
1	The sentence is already correct. Explanation: The sentence "He danced" is grammatically correct as it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule for simple present tense in English language. The subject "he" agrees with its verb "danced", which indicates a past action of the subject. Therefore, there is no need to modify or correct anything in the sentence.
0	The sentence should be "Did Calvin do his homework?" instead of "Did Calvin his homework?" because we need to use a verb after "did" in questions.
1	The sentence is already correct. Explanation: I am returning a "1" for the label because the sentence "Sylvia was slapping Jeff upside the head in martial arts class." is grammatically correct. Therefore, there's no need to modify it. So, for the corrected sentence section, I will simply state that "The sentence is already correct."
1	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence is already correct. Explanation: The sentence "John is likely to leave" is grammatically correct.
1	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence "Was sunk." is not grammatically complete. A proper sentence requires a subject and a verb at the very least. For example, "The ship was sunk." would be a grammatically correct sentence.
0	You probably mean to ask "Who do you think kissed the gorilla?" The original sentence is incorrect because it uses "did" unnecessarily. When asking a question about someone's thoughts or opinions, we use the auxiliary verb "do" only for emphasis or contrast; otherwise, we omit it.
1	The sentence is already correct. Explanation: The sentence "Have you seen my model airplane collection?" does not contain any grammatical errors. Therefore, it is a grammatically correct sentence.
0	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence should be "Four men were arriving at the station as I pulled up" instead of "there were four men arriving at the station when I pulled up". Therefore, the corrected sentence is: Four men were arriving at the station as I pulled up.
1	The sentence is already correct. Explanation: "Jean is reluctant to dance." is a grammatically correct sentence. It expresses that Jean has reservations about dancing. No changes need to be made.
1	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is already correct. (Jean persuaded Robert is a grammatically correct sentence.)
1	The sentence is already correct. The sentence "Jean wants Bill to do the Macarena" is grammatically correct as it follows standard English syntax rules for forming a sentence. It consists of a proper subject ("Jean"), verb ("wants"), and object ("Bill") structure, along with a gerund clause ("to do the Macarena"). Therefore, there's no need for correction.
1	The sentence is already correct.

1	The sentence is already correct. Explanation: The sentence "Heidi likes her violin" is grammatically correct.
0	The sentence should be "John thinks that Mary loves him."
0	The sentence should be "Which pictures of himself does John like?" or "Which pictures of him does John like?" The first option is using a reflexive pronoun to refer back to the subject of the sentence, while the second option uses a regular object pronoun. Both are grammatically correct, but the first one is more commonly used.
0	The sentence should be "An owl hunts mice," as "any" is not appropriate here.
0	The correct form of the sentence would be: "No man ate dinner" or "Not any man ate dinner."
1	The sentence is already correct.

0	The sentence should be: "Any *tigers* have orange fur, marked with black stripes."
0	The sentence is not correct. A true albino tiger actually has white fur, not orange, due to a lack of pigmentation. So the corrected sentence would be: "Any albino tiger has white fur, marked with black stripes."
0	You must pick any flower that you see. Explanation: The original sentence lacks a relative pronoun such as 'that' to connect the clause 'you see'. It also needs an article before 'flower', but since I am assuming only one error per example, I will ignore it here for simplicity.
1	The sentence is already correct.

0	The man whom Mary loves and Sally hates computed my tax. Explanation: When using a compound object ("Mary loves and Sally hates"), it requires a singular verb form such as "whom" to refer back to the subject of the clause. In your original sentence, "who" was used instead of "whom," which would only be grammatically correct if there were no second coordinated verb following "and."
1	The sentence is already correct.

1	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence should be "I like the book that you gave me" if the speaker wants to indicate a specific book from many books that the listener has given them before. Alternatively, if the speaker doesn't want to specify any particular book, they can say "I like the book(s) you give(n) me".
1	The sentence is already correct. Explanation: The sentence "Captain Wentworth wrote a letter to Anne Elliott" follows all of the necessary grammatical rules for standard written English. There are no spelling errors, punctuation issues, subject-verb agreement problems, or other common errors that would require correction. Therefore, I can confirm that the sentence is indeed grammatically correct as it stands.

1	The sentence is already correct. Explanation: The sentence "Magnus went to Ireland" is grammatically correct. It has a clear subject ("Magnus"), verb ("went"), and object ("Ireland"). There are no spelling errors, punctuation errors, or awkward phrasings that would make it incorrect. Therefore, I can confirm that the sentence is indeed correct as written.
0	To whom did John send the book? Explanation: The original question lacks a proper interrogative word to begin the sentence; therefore, it does not follow the structure of a grammatically correct question in English. A more appropriate way to ask this would be using the interrogative pronoun 'to whom' instead of 'who'.
0	The idea dismayed the prime minister that the dome was dull. Explanation: In English, we capitalize the first letter of a person's title when it comes immediately before their name (e.g., "Prime Minister Boris Johnson"), but not when it stands alone as an identifier for their role (e.g., "the prime minister"). Additionally, British spelling uses "dome" instead of "Dome".
0	He came right in without even knocking. Explanation: The original sentence contains some awkward phrasing and incorrect word order. A more natural way to express the idea would be "He came right in without even knocking." This version uses standard English syntax and eliminates unnecessary words such as "so much as" which do not add any meaning to the sentence. Additionally, it is preferable to use "even" rather than "so much as" for emphasis when negating verb phrases.
1	The sentence is already correct. Explanation: The sentence "Harriet admired Mr Knightley" is grammatically correct. There are no spelling errors, punctuation errors, or grammatical errors in the sentence. Therefore, I would rate it as a level 1 on my scale, which means that the sentence is completely accurate and requires no corrections.
0	The sentence is already correct. Explanation: The sentence "The book is boring" is grammatically correct but may be subjective based on personal opinions about the book. However, without additional context implying a different intended meaning, there are no objective grammatical errors to correct.

1	The sentence is already correct. Explanation: Frank Churchill crossed the street is a grammatically correct sentence. It has a proper subject-verb agreement as "Frank Churchill" is singular and "crossed," which is the verb, is also singular. Additionally, it follows the basic structure of a simple sentence having a subject and predicate. Therefore, no correction is required here.
1	The sentence is already correct. Explanation: The sentence "Emma and Harriet were attacked yesterday" follows all of the rules for standard English grammar and usage. It contains a clear subject ("Emma and Harriet") and verb ("were attacked"), as well as proper punctuation. Therefore, it can be considered grammatically correct.
5	The sentence is already correct. Explanation: The sentence is grammatically correct but it would be better to say "Fiona may be here by 5 o'clock" as "might" implies a greater degree of uncertainty than "may".
0	The sentence should be "I am both expecting to get the job and I think it is a desirable one." Instead, the original sentence says "of the opinion," which is incorrect; it should say "I think" instead. Additionally, there needs to be another instance of "is" before "a desirable one" for subject-verb agreement.
1	The sentence is already correct.
0	Kim alienated cats and beat his dog. Explanation: The verb "beat" must be used instead of "beating" because it matches the subject-verb agreement required for the simple past tense. Additionally, there needs to be a period at the end of the sentence rather than using two separate thoughts with only a space between them.
1	The sentence is already correct.
0	Which article did Terry file without reading? Explanation: The word 'papers' is unnecessary in this context because it is implied by the verb 'file'. Additionally, there is no need for a determiner before 'article', making the corrected sentence read as follows: "Which article did Terry file without reading?"
1	The sentence is already correct. Explanation: The sentence "I want to try and buy some whiskey" is grammatically correct as it follows standard English syntax rules.
0	She goes and buys some whiskey. The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence should be "Kim and Terry are happy."
1	The sentence is already correct. Explanation: There are no grammatical errors or incorrect usage of words in the provided sentence. Therefore, it can be considered as grammatically correct.
1	The sentence is already correct.
0	Place a picture of Bill on your desk by tomorrow; the girl in the red coat will do the same before then. Explanation: The original sentence contains some awkward phrasing that can be improved for clarity and proper grammar usage. It's important to use parallel construction when presenting two similar actions in a single sentence. Additionally, I added appropriate conjunctions and punctuation marks where necessary.
0	The sentence should be "Bill's picture, the girl in the red coat will place on your desk before tomorrow." Here is the corrected version: "Bill's picture, the girl in the red coat will put on your desk before tomorrow."
1	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is already correct.
0	Which books about cooking does Henri want to buy? Explanation: The verb "does" needs to agree with its subject "Henri". Since "Henri" is a third person singular noun, we need to use the form of the verb that corresponds to it. In addition, we also need to put the question word ("which") before the auxiliary verb ("does").
0	I will fix the computer for Carole. Confusion may arise between the names Caroline and Carol. Since there is no context to suggest that the person's name here is Carolyn instead of Carol, it would be best to add an e to make sure the name matches what was intended by the speaker or writer.

0	The soup cooks and then thickens. Explanation: In this case, there needs to be a conjunction such as 'and' between two actions that happen separately. Without it, the sentence implies that the soup is both cooking and thickening at exactly the same time which isn't possible.
1	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence "John asked." is missing additional context to be grammatically complete. A corrected version could be "John asked a question" or "John asked for directions," depending on the intended meaning.
0	The sentence should be "I even saw the student." Instead of "I saw even the student.", because when we use "even" to emphasize a word in a sentence, it usually comes before that word.
0	The corrected sentence is "John whispered that Mary had left."
0	Bill will come wonderes Mary. Incorrect. The correct sentence is "Mary wonders whether Bill will come."
0	The sentence should be "Sophie will go to the theater."
1	The sentence is already correct.
0	Mary's mother likes herself. In the original sentence, it states that "Herself likes Mary's mother," but using "herself" as the subject of the sentence implies that the person doing the action is also the object of the sentence. In order to convey the intended meaning correctly, we need to switch the positions of "Mary's mother" and "herself".
1	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence should be "John's mother likes him." instead of "John's mother to see the world burn. He enjoys it when people suffer."
0	Mary revealed herself to John.
1	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is already correct.
0	The correct form of the sentence would be "Henry found that Bill was sad." since the action of finding occurred before the state of being sad.
0	John considers himself to be proud of Mary. Explanation: The verb "considers" requires that we use "to be" after it when talking about feelings ("proud" here being a feeling). Therefore, the original sentence needs to include "to be".
0	The sentence should be "You should sit before it." or "You should sit down first.", as the original sentence is grammatically incorrect.
1	The sentence is already correct. Explanation: This sentence is grammatically correct as it stands.
0	The correct sentence is "Everyone hopes that everyone else will sleep."
1	The sentence is already correct.
0	The only person who remembered Churchill giving the "Blood, Sweat and Tears" speech was Churchill himself. Explanation: In your original sentence, there were a couple of issues that needed to be corrected for proper grammar and clarity. I added the word "only" at the beginning to clarify that Churchill was the only one remembering his own speech. Additionally, I changed "you are an English teacher" to "I am an English teacher," as it makes more sense in first-person point of view. Lastly, I rephrased some parts to improve overall readability while maintaining accuracy.
0	The correct sentence is "John promised Mary that he would shave himself."
1	The sentence is already correct.
0	The corrected sentence is "I saw Bill while you did so," or "I saw Bill while you were doing that, Mary." The original sentence is missing a clear reference for who was doing what, causing confusion without additional context.
0	The sentence should be "What Mary did was give Bill a book," as the subject of the second clause needs to match the action described by "what" in the first part of the sentence.
0	The sentence should be "The bear sniffs" if referring to a single bear, or "The bears sniff" if referring to multiple bears. The verb must agree in number with its subject.
0	The sentence should be "Stealing talismans from witches is dangerous." (There needs to be a present participle verb form "stealing" instead of the base form "to steal". Also, it's better for clarity to include the article "the" before "witches")
0	The sentence should be "Anson denounced" if you want to express the idea of strongly criticizing someone or something. "Demonize" means to describe someone or something as evil.
0	The sentence should be "You guys kicked yourselves" or "You all kicked yourselves," as the reflexive pronoun "yourselves" requires a plural subject. Alternatively, if referring to multiple people but using second person informally, one could say "Y'all kicked y'alls selves."
0	The book that I said I'd never read. Explanation: In the original sentence, there were two instances of "that" which made it unnecessarily wordy and repetitive. By removing one instance of "that", we get a clearer and more concise sentence.
0	The corrected sentence is "Anson **demonstrated** up the Khyber," but note that even with the correction, the sentence still may not make complete sense without additional context.
1	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence should be "Kick **you**!" This is a command directed towards the person being addressed, so there should not be a question mark at the end of the sentence. Additionally, since it's a command, the subject ("you") typically comes after the verb ("kick"). However, if you meant to say "Kick me!" instead, then that would be grammatically correct as well, but with a different meaning.
1	The sentence is already correct. Explanation: There are no grammatical errors or awkward phrasing in the sentence provided. Therefore, it can be considered a grammatically correct sentence.
0	To whom did you give an accurate description? Explanation: The subject pronoun who should be used as the object pronoun whom in formal writing. In informal situations, many people use who instead of whom, but it's generally considered more grammatically correct to use whom when referring to a specific person that has been mentioned earlier in the sentence.
1	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence lacks a complete thought. A suitable verb and object would make it grammatically correct. For example: "The government imposed a fine."
1	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence should be "Anson **denounced** David every day" as 'denounce' means to publicly declare something to be wrong or evil. 'Demonize' means to describe someone or something as wicked or threatening, which doesn't fit the context here.
4	There is a program about Euripides on Radio 4 tonight. Explanation: The word "a" before "Radio 4" should be lowercase as it functions as an adjective modifying "program". Also, there should not be a space between "about" and its following noun.
1	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence should be "Extremely frantantly, Anson danced at the trade" if it's referring to a specific event called 'the trade'. Otherwise, if there is no article before 'trade', then it would mean some general activity of dancing at a place called 'Trade', which may not make much sense depending on the context. Therefore, I suggest adding an article for clarity.
0	You asked what Medea gave. Explanation: The original question has a subject-verb agreement error. In the corrected version of the sentence, the verb "asked" agrees in number with its singular subject "you". Additionally, I changed "who" to "what", as the object of the verb "gave" requires an object complement rather than a relative pronoun.
1	The sentence is already correct. Explanation: The sentence "It's Anson that I like" contains a grammatically correct use of the pronoun "it," which refers to the subject "Anson." This type of construction is called a cleft sentence, where the focus of the sentence is emphasized using a form of "be" verb followed by "that" clause. In this case, the emphasis is on "Anson" as the person being liked. So, there is no need for any correction here.
0	The sentence should be "Medea tried to poison her children through the nurse."
0	The sentence "I felt that I know you" is incorrect. It should be "I felt that I knew you." This change is necessary because we use the past tense of the verb ("knew") to indicate that the knowing occurred before another past action ("felt").
0	The sentence should be "Will he be able to do it?" instead of "Will he can do it?" because "will" is used for future tense while "be able to" indicates possibility.
0	The sentence should be "I saw that she was happy."
1	The sentence is already correct. Explanation: The sentence "Anson believed himself to be handsome" is grammatically correct. There are no spelling errors, punctuation errors, subject-verb agreement issues, tense inconsistencies, or other common grammatical problems. Additionally, the word order follows standard English syntax rules. Therefore, I would rate this sentence as 1 for being grammatically correct.
1	The sentence is already correct. Explanation: I have checked the sentence "We arrived about six o'clock" and found no grammatical errors or incorrect usage of words. Therefore, it can be concluded that the sentence is grammatically correct.
0	The sentence should be "Gilgamesh has fought the dragon" or "Gilgamesh was fighting the dragon". In present perfect tense, we use 'has' instead of 'is'.
0	The corrected sentence is "Anson thought he was happy."
1	The sentence is already correct.
0	The corrected sentence should be "I may not be going to the party but will be washing my hair" or "I might not go to the party but will wash my hair". The original sentence contains a mixture of future tense ("might") and present continuous tense ("am going", which could be shortened to "going"), as well as leaving out the subject ("will be washing my hair").
0	He liked me. Explanation: The reflexive pronoun "myself" is incorrect here because it implies that the speaker performed some action on themselves. In this case, using the regular object pronoun "me" correctly conveys that someone else performed an action on them.
1	The sentence is already correct. Explanation: The sentence "The butler sent the poison to Dinah" follows all of the rules of standard written English. It contains a subject ("the butler"), a verb ("sent"), and an object ("the poison"). Additionally, it uses preposition correctly ("to Dinah") and ends with a period. Therefore, I would rate this as a grammatically correct sentence.
0	The sentence is confusing due to multiple instances of "to" and extra words that can be removed without changing the meaning. A clearer way to express it would be: "Jason seems sick."
0	Who did you ask what they saw? OR What did you ask them when they saw? Explanation: The original question has a word order issue that makes it unclear. To clarify, we need to specify either who was seen or what action those people took before being asked about it.
1	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence "He can will go" is not correct. The corrected sentence is "He will be able to go."
0	A more grammatically correct way to ask this question would be "How fierce was the battle?" if referring to a past event, or "How fierce is the battle?" if referring to an ongoing one.
0	You asked which king, and which city he invaded? Explanation: The original sentence has a misplaced modifier ("which city invaded") that makes it unclear what the intended meaning is. I have rephrased the sentence to make its structure clearer and avoid ambiguity.
0	The sentence is not correct. Here's a corrected version: "It is some disgruntled old pigs *that people love to eat* in those ditches."
0	The sentence should be: "The monkey is eating the banana."
0	The sentence should be "Burn it!" if referring to a singular object. Otherwise, "Burn them!" would be appropriate for multiple objects.
0	The sentence should be "It's too bad that Aphrodite is omnipotent." Instead of "It stinks that Aphrodite is omnipotent." because 'it stinks' is colloquial and informal for expressing disapproval or disappointment, while 'it's too bad' is a more formal way to convey similar sentiment.
1	The sentence is already correct. Agamemnon seems to be a maniac is grammatically correct. It follows standard subject-verb-object word order and uses appropriate punctuation. Additionally, there are no spelling errors or incorrect words used. Therefore, I would rate it as 1 for being grammatically correct.
0	The sentence is already correct. Confidence: 100%
1	The sentence is already correct.
0	I asked when we could leave. Explanation: The verb "inquire" typically implies a more formal tone than "ask," but both can be used to request information. However, "when could we leave" functions as a noun clause here, acting as the direct object of the sentence; therefore, it needs to follow a form that uses a subjunctive mood for proper grammatical construction. Thus, using "asked" instead of "inquired" would make the sentence grammatically correct while preserving its intended meaning.
0	The sentence requires a direct object for the verb "kicked" to make it grammatically complete. For example, "They kicked the ball."
0	The monkey ate the banana.
0	The sentence should be "I would like to be able to swim."
0	The sentence is not grammatically complete. A better version could be "I kicked myself accidentally" or "I kicked myself out of frustration," depending on context and intended meaning.
0	The sentence should be "The bookcase is run," since bookcases don't move on their own. Alternatively, if you meant to say that someone moved the bookcase, it would be "Someone ran the bookcase" or "Someone moved the bookcase." However, without additional context, I suspect that what you actually wanted to say was simply "The bookshelf is full," which means that there are many books on the shelf.
0	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence should be "Anson became muscular" or "Anson became a muscular person". The original sentence is incorrect because "muscle-bound" is an adjective that means having large muscles that are stiff and inflexible due to overdevelopment, so it cannot be used as a noun.
