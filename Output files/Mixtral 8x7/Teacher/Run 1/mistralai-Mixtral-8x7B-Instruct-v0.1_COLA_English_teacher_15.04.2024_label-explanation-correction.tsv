1	This sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure for an English sentence (subject + verb + object), and all words are used appropriately within their context.	The sentence is already correct.
0	In the sentence "The weights made the rope stretch over the pulley," the word "stretch" is used incorrectly. It seems like the intended meaning is that the rope became longer due to the weight of the objects attached to it. However, "stretch" means to extend oneself over a distance; become long or wider. Instead, one of its synonyms such as "extend" can be more appropriate here.	The weights made the rope extend over the pulley.
1	The sentence "The mechanical doll wriggled itself loose" is grammatically correct. Here, the subject of the sentence is "the mechanical doll," which is performing the action described by the verb "wriggled." The reflexive pronoun "itself" refers back to the subject, indicating that the doll is acting on itself to become free. This structure correctly conveys a meaning of self-action and agency for the doll.	The sentence is already correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It follows the proper structure of a conditional statement in English where if the condition (in this case, "If you had eaten more") were true, it describes what would have happened as a result ("you would want less"). The tenses used for each part of the sentence also agree with one another.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in this sentence. The subject of the sentence is "you," which is singular, but the verb "eat" is paired with a plural pronoun "the most." Additionally, there's no clear connection between eating a lot and wanting less; therefore, the meaning of the sentence is unclear as well.	Since you have eaten the most, you seem to want the least.
0	This sentence contains a logical error known as an inverse proportion fallacy. It implies that wanting something more will result in eating less, which is not necessarily true. Moreover, there is no main verb in the first part of the sentence, making it grammatically incorrect. A better way to express the intended meaning could be "The less one wants, the more they tend to eat," but even this statement can't be taken as universally applicable since people's behaviors differ greatly depending on various factors.	The sentence cannot be corrected because its implied meaning is logically flawed; however, if we were to rephrase it based on actual facts instead, it might read like this: Eating when not hungry often leads to overeating.
0	The sentence contains a common error known as "misrelated phrases." In this case, the subject of the first clause ("the more John eat") does not match the subject of the second clause ("he pays"). Additionally, "eat" should be "eats" to agree with its singular subject "John". A corrected version would use the same subject for both clauses, such as "The more John eats, the more he has to pay."	The sentence should be: "The more John eats, the more he has to pay."
0	This sentence needs a conjunction to connect the two clauses because they share the subject "she". Without one, it implies that only listening to the band causes depression, which may be untrue depending on context. The comma before "she" also suggests a run-on sentence.	Mary listens to the Grateful Dead, and she gets depressed.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure for each clause ("Mary got" and "she looked"), uses appropriate verb tenses, and employs proper punctuation. There are no grammatical errors or awkward phrasings to indicate incorrectness.	The sentence is already correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("the higher stakes"), a verb ("are"), and a predicate adjective ("lower") that describes the subject. The comparative form of the adjective ("higher" and "lower") is used correctly to show comparison between two things.	The higher the stakes, the lower his expectations are. Alternatively, I could have written "The sentence is already correct." since no corrections were necessary.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It follows the standard structure of a comparative sentence, where two things are being compared using the words "more" and "less". In this case, the degree to which Fred is obnoxious is being compared to the amount of attention paid to him.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "John was lots more obnoxious than Fred" is grammatically correct. Here, 'lots' acts as an adverb modifying the comparative form of the adjective 'more obnoxious'. It implies a greater degree of difference between John's level of obnoxiousness compared to Fred's.	The sentence is already correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It follows a clear subject-verb agreement rule and uses proper word order. Additionally, it communicates a logical idea using appropriate vocabulary and idiomatic expressions ("the more...the more").	The sentence is already correct.
0	This sentence contains a common error known as "misrelated antecedents" because it incorrectly compares two different things ("the more Bill smokes" and "Susan hates him"). A better way to express this idea would be to say "Bill smokes more, and Susan hates him more."	Bill smokes more, and Susan hates him more.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct because it follows standard subject-verb agreement rules and uses proper punctuation and capitalization. Additionally, the word order makes sense and the meaning can be easily understood.	The more pictures of him that appear in the news, the more embarrassed John becomes. (The given sentence is already correct.)
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject ("every senator") agrees with the verb tense ("seems"). Additionally, any potential ambiguity regarding the pronoun reference has been avoided by specifying "he" instead of using a singular "they," which would have required a gender-neutral antecedent such as "senators" rather than "senator."	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence contains a fragment that is ungrammatical. The clause "he likes" lacks a main verb and therefore cannot stand alone as a complete thought. Additionally, there is no clear relationship between the two clauses "John visits Sally" and "he likes". To fix this issue, we need to add a proper object for the second clause or rephrase it so that it forms a coherent sentence.	The corrected sentence could be one of the following options: * John visits Sally because he likes her. * John visits Sally, which he enjoys. * John visits Sally, and he likes doing so.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows the standard structure of a simple sentence, consisting of a single independent clause. The subject ("Marianne") is clearly identified, as is the verb ("did not leave"). Additionally, the negation used in this sentence is appropriate for conveying the intended meaning.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows the rule of using the past perfect tense ("could not have been") to indicate an action that began and ended before another past action or time. Here, it implies that he stopped working before some other past event or time.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The negation of the verb "can" should be done using "cannot" instead of "can not". Therefore, the correct form should be "He cannot have been working."	He cannot have been working.
1	The sentence "You will believe Bob" is grammatically correct. There are no spelling errors, punctuation errors, or grammatical errors in the sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "John has not kissed Mary" is grammatically correct. It follows the standard subject-verb-object word order of a simple sentence in English. Additionally, the use of the contraction "has not" instead of "has never" is appropriate for indicating a past negative action.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is correctly written in terms of grammar, punctuation, and spelling. It uses the past perfect tense ("had I seen") to express an action completed before another point in the past, which is appropriately used here as it sets up a contrast between the speaker's previous experiences and their current observation about Bangor.	The sentence is already correct.
0	In this sentence, "it" is incorrect because it is a direct object and needs to be placed after the verb. The correct form would use "that" instead of "it," so the pronoun refers to something specific previously mentioned. Also, there's no need for an article before "mickey".	The sentence corrected is as follows - "Mickey looked up at it."
0	The subject ("There") and verb ("tended") do not agree in number. In this case, "there" is functioning as a dummy subject, which means the real subject comes later in the sentence. Here, it's "a lot of discussion," but since "lot" is considered singular, we need a singular form of the verb. So instead of saying "There tended to be," it should say "There tended to be one." However, even after making this change, the sentence would still sound awkward and unnatural. A more natural way to express this idea might be "People often discussed a lot of things."	People often discussed a lot of things.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and the word choice is appropriate. There are no spelling errors or punctuation issues.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It consists of a proper noun ("John") as the subject, followed by a verb ("is") and an adjective ("eager"). There are no spelling errors, punctuation marks are used correctly, and there is nothing missing from the sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and conveys a clear meaning. It follows the standard structure of a simple sentence, consisting of a subject ("we") and a predicate ("want John to win"). There are no spelling errors or awkward phrasings.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "The box contained the ball from the tree" is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("the box"), a verb ("contained"), and an object ("the ball"). The prepositional phrase "from the tree" modifies "the ball," clarifying where it came from but not affecting the grammatical structure of the sentence. Therefore, there are no errors to correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	In this sentence, the verb "escaped" does not agree with its subject "the tube". A more appropriate verb would be "leaked", which means to escape from a closed container. Additionally, the preposition used after "by" is incorrect; it should be replaced with "with" since gas is the cause of the leaking.	The tube was leaked by gas. OR The tube leaked with gas inside it.
1	The sentence "Water bubbled up out of the kettle" is grammatically correct. There are no spelling errors, punctuation errors, or grammatical errors in the sentence. Additionally, the verb tense is consistent throughout the sentence, and the word order follows standard English syntax rules.	The sentence is already correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple subject ("the tub") and a verb ("leaked"), followed by the object of the verb ("water"). There are no spelling errors or awkward phrasings to correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "do" is unnecessary here because we can simply say "The water filled the bottle." Using "did" implies a contrast with another action, but no such contrast has been provided.	The water filled the bottle.
0	The subject ("the water") and verb ("did") in this sentence do not agree in number. Since "water" is singular, the third person singular form of the verb must be used, which is "does," not "did." Additionally, a more natural phrasing would use a passive voice construction such as "The bottle was filled by the water."	The water filled the whole bottle. Alternatively, "The bottle was filled by the water" could also be used for a passive voice construction.
0	In this sentence, there is a mistake with the verb tense agreement. The past participle "leaked" must agree with its subject "the tank," which is singular. Therefore, it requires an auxiliary verb such as "has" to make it grammatically correct. Also, the word "free" needs to be replaced by "freely" because we need an adverb here instead of an adjective.	The tank has leaked the fluid freely.
0	The verb "lay" requires a direct object to show what is being laid. In this case, "ball" is the direct object. However, the past tense of "lay" is "laid", so the correct sentence would be "John laid the ball in the box".	John laid the ball in the box.
1	The sentence "John owns the book" is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple subject ("John") and a predicate ("owns the book"). The verb "owns" agrees with its singular subject "John," and the definite article "the" precedes the noun "book" appropriately.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "We persuaded Mary to leave and Sue to stay" is grammatically correct. It uses a construction called "coordinated infinitives," where two verbs share the same subject and object. In this case, "Mary" is the shared subject and "to leave" and "to stay" are the coordinated infinitives. This structure is commonly used in English and does not require repetition of the subject or object for each verb.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There is a subtle distinction being made between what most people think ("consider") and what the courts have determined ("didn't actually find"). This construction effectively conveys the difference of opinion between general public perception and legal verdicts.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence follows the correct subject-verb-object order and uses an adverb ("beautifully") to modify the verb ("plays"). There are no grammatical errors or awkward phrasings in the sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence contains two errors related to subject-verb agreement and modal verb usage. In the first part of the sentence, "John" is a singular noun, so it requires a singular verb form. Therefore, instead of "will learn," we need "will **learn**." Additionally, using "probably" before "will" implies doubt about learning rather than certainty; thus, the more appropriate construction would be "is probably going to learn." Overall, the corrected version should read as follows:	Clearly, John probably is going to learn French perfectly.
0	In English, we typically say "Sue gave Bill a book," without using "to" before the indirect object "Bill." Using "to" in this way is more commonly seen in older forms of English or in certain specific contexts, but it's generally considered incorrect in modern American English.	Sue gave Bill a book.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("the men") and a verb tense that indicates future action ("will leave"). There are no spelling errors, punctuation errors, or other grammatical issues present in the sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "John went home" is grammatically correct. It consists of a proper subject ("John") and a past-tense verb ("went"). Additionally, it follows standard English syntax rules by placing the subject before the verb.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence contains two errors related to preposition usage. Instead of "to" after "represented," it should be "as." Also, instead of "as" before "a genuine linguist," it should be "who is." These changes are necessary for the sentence to correctly convey its intended meaning.	They represented themselves seriously to Dean Mary as a linguist who is genuine.
0	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in this sentence. In English, a verb must agree in number with its subject; in this case, the plural subject "they" requires a plural verb form such as "love". However, the provided sentence uses the singular form of the verb "love", which does not match the plural subject "they". This error makes the sentence grammatically incorrect.	The sentence should be corrected to read: "They love us," where both the subject ("they") and the verb ("love") agree in number and form a grammatical sentence.
1	The sentence "It is nice to go abroad" is grammatically correct. There are no spelling errors, punctuation errors, subject-verb agreement issues, or tense inconsistencies. Additionally, the word order follows standard English syntax rules.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence follows all of the rules of standard written English, so it does not contain any grammatical errors.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "I remembered having kissed Mary" is grammatically correct. It uses the past perfect tense ("had kissed") to indicate a completed action that occurred before another past action. In this case, the speaker remembers kissing Mary at some point in the past.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence contains a comma splice error. A coordinating conjunction ("either" in this case) should be preceded by a semicolon or followed by a comma when joining two independent clauses. Here, there is no prior independent clause to which "either" could refer.	The sentence could be corrected as follows: "I can't believe Fred won't; I can't believe he'll 'either.'" Alternatively, it could also be rephrased as: "I find it hard to believe that Fred will refuse, too."
0	The second half of the sentence contains a subject ("I") but lacks a proper verb for it. Instead, there's just "also" which doesn't serve as a main verb here. To fix this issue, we need to add a suitable verb after 'I'. For example, if we assume that what one person is doing, the other person is going to do too, then we can say 'I also want to read Fred's story.'	The corrected version would be - "John wants to read Fred's story, and I also want to read Fred's story."
0	The second part of the sentence "who to" is incorrect because it lacks a verb. In this case, since "to" indicates an infinitive form of a verb, there needs to be a verb after "who". For example, the corrected version could say "who to invite".	We wanted to invite someone, but we couldn't decide who to invite.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It contains two independent clauses ("Mary will read Fred's story" and "Joe will read Holly's") joined by a coordinating conjunction ("and"). Each clause has a subject ("Mary," "Joe") and a verb ("will read"), and the objects of the verbs are properly identified ("Fred's story," "Holly's").	The sentence is already correct.
0	This sentence is a run-on sentence because it combines two independent clauses ("Mary claimed that she was eating cabbage" and "Holly shouldn't") without proper punctuation or conjunction. To fix this error, we can use a period to separate the two clauses into separate sentences, add a coordinating conjunction such as "but" between them, or use a semicolon to connect them.	* Mary claimed that she was eating cabbage, but Holly shouldn't. * Mary claimed that she was eating cabbage; Holly shouldn't either. * Mary ate some cabbage, but Holly shouldn't.
0	The second half of the sentence "I also came to be" is grammatically incorrect. It's not idiomatic to say "come to be" in this context. Instead, it should simply be "and so did I". This construction uses a correlative conjunction ("so") and the auxiliary verb "did", which matches the past tense of the first clause ("came").	Mary came to be introduced by the bartender and so did I.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and makes sense in context. The subject of the sentence ("I") matches the verb tense ("can" and "will"), and there are no spelling errors or awkward phrasings.	The sentence is already correct.
0	In this sentence, there is a lack of consistency in subject-verb agreement. The verb "bother" agrees with the singular noun "neuroses," but it doesn't agree with the plural noun "patrons" later in the sentence. To fix this issue, we need to ensure consistent subject-verb agreement throughout the sentence.	The corrected sentence would be: "Joe's neurosis bothers his patrons, and so does Sally's." Alternatively, if Joe has multiple neuroses that collectively bother his patrons, the original sentence could be revised as follows: "Joe's neuroses bother his patrons, and so do Sally's."
0	The pronoun used in the second part of the sentence ("it") does not clearly refer to anything. It seems to imply that Lilly read a book for some unspecified reason, but the intended meaning is likely that Lilly read the same book that José did not read.	I know which book José didn't read for class, and which book Lilly did instead of him.
0	The second part of the sentence contains multiple errors. Specifically, there is a missing pronoun before "do" and the word "it" does not have a clear antecedent. It is unclear what exactly Fred will not do.	The sentence could be corrected as follows: "This is the book which Bob reviewed, and this is the one which Fred refuses to review."
0	The second part of the sentence contains a mistake related to subject-verb agreement. It says 'you hadn't', but it should be 'you haven't'. This is because we use 'hadn't' for past perfect tense, while here we need present perfect tense as we have used 'said' earlier in the same sentence referring to something that happened before another action (Mag reading a book), so both parts must agree grammatically.	I know which book Mag read, and which book Bob said that you haven't.
0	The sentence contains multiple errors. There is a missing article before "report," and it would be more grammatically correct to say "the report you hadn't" rather than "my report that you hadn't." Additionally, there is no verb connecting "Bob read" and "you hadn't," making the sentence difficult to follow.	I know which book Mag read and which book Bob read. Here is the report that you hadn't seen yet.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It expresses a preference for someone eating fruit over cookies using the comparative form of the adverb “more” followed by the conjunction “than.” Additionally, subject-verb agreement is maintained throughout as well as proper use of verb tense and word order.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence contains a redundancy error. The word "did" is unnecessary because the auxiliary verb "talked" has already been used to form the past tense of the verb.	Rusty talked about himself only after Mary talked about him.
0	The sentence contains a redundant use of the verb 'talk' after 'Rusty did'. This kind of repetition can make a sentence sound awkward and unnatural. It would be better to say either 'Fred talked about everything before Rusty did.' or 'Fred talked about everything before Rusty talked about something.', but not both together.	Fred talked about everything before Rusty talked about something. OR Fred talked about everything before Rusty did.
1	The sentence "John often meets Mary" is grammatically correct. There are no spelling errors, punctuation errors, or grammatical errors in the sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The verb "perceives" does not agree with its subject "the problem". In present tense, third-person singular subjects require the addition of an -s to the base form of verbs. Therefore, the correct form of the verb for the subject "problem" would be "perceives", but since it's a general statement about problems in general, we use the plural form of the noun and corresponding verb form, which is "problems perceive" or simply "perception is easy."	The sentence could be corrected as follows: * Label: 1 * Explanation: N/A * The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "A hundred men surrounded the fort" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "A hundred men" is a valid noun phrase consisting of a number followed by a plural countable noun. * "surrounded" is the past tense of the verb "to surround," which takes the preposition "the" to indicate its direct object. * "the fort" is a proper noun functioning as the direct object of the verb "surrounded." Therefore, I can confirm that "A hundred men surrounded the fort" is a grammatically correct sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
0	In English, we do not use the first person pronoun ("me") as the subject of a verb when referring to past actions involving multiple people. Instead, we would say "They elected me" or "We elected me," but since there's no clear antecedent for "we" in the original sentence, it doesn't make sense here. A better way to express what I believe the speaker intends would be "I was elected."	The sentence "I was elected" is grammatically correct.
0	The sentence contains a misplaced modifier, which makes it unclear what the subject of the sentence "he" refers to. Specifically, the relative clause "that John was incompetent" is modifying the nearest noun "report," but clearly, we don't mean that the report itself was incompetent; rather, we want to say that John submitted some report about his own incompetence. To fix this issue, we need to rephrase the sentence so that it becomes clear what the intended meaning is.	Which report did he submit stating that John was incompetent? Or alternatively: Which report indicating John's incompetence did he submit?
1	The sentence "Mary has always preferred lemons to limes" is grammatically correct. It uses the past perfect tense ("has preferred") correctly to indicate a preference that began in the past and continues into the present. Additionally, it uses the comparative form of the noun ("lemons to limes") appropriately to compare two things.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence is missing a verb for the subject "the cats," making it grammatically incorrect. Additionally, there should be a preposition to indicate where the cats are being let, such as "outside" or "into another room."	He let the cats that were whining outside.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct but it lacks context as to who Bill is and when the action took place. It would be better if there were more details provided for clarity. However, based solely on grammar and structure, the sentence is indeed correct.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence follows all of the necessary grammar rules for standard English. It has a clear subject ("Mary"), verb ("saw"), and object ("the boy"). Additionally, it uses proper tense ("walking") to indicate ongoing action. There is also appropriate prepositional phrasing ("toward the railroad station").	The sentence is already correct.
0	The past participle of the verb "give" should be "given," but instead it's misspelled as "giver." Additionally, there is a missing article before "John."	A proof that the claim had been given was that John had lied.
0	The sentence contains multiple errors in word order and phrasing. In addition, it uses the passive voice unnecessarily, making the subject difficult to identify. It's also missing appropriate punctuation for clarity.	The fire that destroyed most of my factory can be attributed to a short circuit, which was caused by an overloaded transducer.
0	In this sentence, there is a missing preposition before the word "Dartmouth". It would be grammatically correct to say either "the proposal to build a sidewalk from Dartmouth to Smith" or "the proposal to build a sidewalk between Dartmouth and Smith", but the current version of the sentence is incorrect because it lacks the necessary preposition.	The mayor regarded as being absurd the proposal to build a sidewalk from Dartmouth to Smith. (This sentence could be corrected by adding the necessary preposition, for example: "The mayor regarded as being absurd the proposal to build a sidewalk from Dartmouth to Smith.")
0	The sentence contains a mistake known as a dangling modifier. In this case, "to remain a secret" is modifying something, but it's unclear what because the subject of the main clause ("Bill") has already been mentioned. A corrected version would make clear what is being kept secret.	To keep Bill's departure a secret, he left without telling anyone.
0	The sentence contains multiple errors. Specifically, there is a repeated word ("drives") and an incorrect use of the pronoun "who" instead of "that". Also, it appears that the speaker is trying to say that Tom regularly drives a certain man, but the phrasing makes it unclear whether the man being driven is named Tom or if someone else is driving him.	I know a man whom Tom often drives. OR I know a man named Tom who frequently drives.
0	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in this sentence. The plural subject "cats" does not agree with the singular verb form "is". Additionally, it's generally best to avoid passive voice constructions when possible, so instead of saying "which is against the law," consider revising to say "an illegal act."	Drowning cats are hard to rescue; it's against the law to let them suffer.
0	The sentence contains a redundancy error. The word "else" is unnecessary because "nothing" already means "not anything additional". Therefore, saying "nothing else" is repetitive.	Muriel said nothing that she had been insulted. OR Muriel merely said that she had been insulted. OR All Muriel said was that she had been insulted.
0	The subject ("Himself") and verb ("is understood") do not agree in number. "Himself" is singular while "are understood" requires a plural noun.	The sentence should be either "He is understood by Rutherford" if referring to a male person named He, or "It is understood by Rutherford" if referring to something being understood. Alternatively, it could also be written as "Rutherford understands himself," depending on what exactly is meant.
1	The sentence "I feel that Arch will show up" is grammatically correct. Here's why: - "I feel" is a common expression used to indicate one's opinion or intuition about something. It is followed by a clause starting with "that". - "Arch" is a proper noun referring to a person or thing, which can be the subject of the second clause. - "will show up" indicates future action and agrees with the singular subject "Arch". Therefore, the sentence is already correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	There is a mistake in capitalization. In English, we always capitalize the first letter of a sentence. Therefore, "the" needs to be capitalized. Additionally, there is no need for a period before "Firstly," as it starts the sentence. Lastly, the word "proof" is misspelled; it should be spelled "Prove."	The proof that this set is recursive is difficult to establish.
0	In this sentence, there is a lack of clarity regarding to whom the pronoun “which” refers. It could refer to either the madrigals or the way Henry plays the lute and sings. Additionally, it would be more grammatically correct to use the conjunction “and” instead of the comma before “sound.” Here is the corrected version of the sentence:	The madrigals that Henry sings and accompanies on the lute sound lousy.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It consists of three independent clauses connected by appropriate conjunctions ("and"and""), and each clause has a subject-verb agreement. There are no grammatical errors or awkward constructions to fix.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence is a question fragment and lacks proper context to be considered grammatically complete. It consists of two independent clauses connected by the conjunction 'and', but without any accompanying auxiliary verb to support the interrogative form. To make it a proper question, one could rephrase as follows: "Where did you go, and what did each person eat?"	Where did you go, and what did each person eat?
0	The sentence contains multiple errors. There is a missing article before "boy's," and it should be "boys'" to indicate possession. Additionally, there is no need for possessive forms after "guardian" and "employer." Lastly, "president" needs an article as well. A possible correction could be: "Which boy's guardian did we elect as the employer's president?" However, without more context, it is difficult to say if even this corrected version makes sense.	Without knowing the intended meaning of the original sentence, I cannot provide a single grammatically correct alternative. Here is one possibility based on my interpretation: "Whose son did we choose to become both the guardian and the employer's president?"
0	The word "sane" requires a linking verb such as "is," "was," etc., to connect it to the subject of the sentence. Therefore, the correct form would be "How sanE is Peter?" but this still may sound awkward depending on context because we usually use adjectives like "sane" to describe someone's state immediately after the copular verb without using "how". A more natural way to ask this question might be "Is Peter sane?"	Is Peter sane?
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and uses appropriate punctuation marks. It also conveys a clear meaning about the location of the speaker's house and their father's house relative to Route 150 and two different rivers.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The pronoun 'it' in the second clause of the sentence refers to 'the place', but 'Route 150' is the antecedent intended by the speaker. Therefore, the pronoun must be replaced with 'Route 150'.	The corrected sentence would be: "I live at the place where Route 150 crosses the Hudson River and my dad lives at Route 150 too."
0	The correct preposition to use after the verb "make up" when talking about apologizing to someone is "to," but the word "up" can be omitted so it becomes "who is she trying to make to now?" However, even without the error, the sentence structure is still informal and could benefit from being rephrased for clarity and proper grammar usage. A better way of asking the same question would be: "To whom is she attempting to reconcile now?" or "Who is she trying to appease now?"	To whom is she attempting to reconcile now?
0	The past participle form of the verb 'get' is 'gotten' when used in a transitive sense (meaning it takes an object), as in "I have got**ten** a new car". However, here, the error lies in using 'gotten' instead of the simple past tense 'got'. In addition, there seems to be some confusion regarding the passive voice; consider revising the sentence for clarity. I suppose you want to say something like "A plan to negotiate an honorable end to the war in Vietnam had been winded up" if talking about finishing a previous attempt. Otherwise, "Wind was involved in a plot to negotiate an honorable end to the war in Vietnam" might work. But without context, it is difficult to provide accurate corrections.	Based on my suggestions above, either "A plan to negotiate an honorable end to the war in Vietnam had been winded up" or "Wind was involved in a plot to negotiate an honorable end to the war in Vietnam," depending upon what exactly you intend to convey by this sentence.
0	The sentence contains a preposition error. In English, we say "talked to someone about something," so the correct order here would be "Mike talked to my friends about politics yesterday" instead of "Mike talked about politics yesterday to my friends."	Mike talked to my friends about politics yesterday.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no spelling errors, punctuation errors, subject-verb agreement issues, or other grammatical problems.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The pronoun used to refer to the person wearing the hat should be consistent throughout the sentence. In this case, "she" is used as the pronoun, but it's likely that Mike is a man, so the pronoun should also be "he". Additionally, using both male ("Mike") and female ("she") pronouns for the same person can create confusion and ambiguity.	Either use "he" consistently throughout the sentence, such as: "Which hat did Mike quip that he never wore?" OR rephrase the sentence to make the gender clearer, such as: "Mike quipped that they never wore the hat in question."
0	The sentence contains a grammatical error known as a misplaced modifier. In this case, "never" is incorrectly applied to "which girl," when it should be applied to "Mike." Additionally, there is no clear antecedent for "this hat." It's unclear whether "this hat" refers to something previously mentioned or if it's meant to refer to the hat being worn by the person who is speaking.	Who did Mike say never wore this hat? Or, alternatively: Which girl did Mike say never wore her hat? These revised versions of the original sentence clarify the meaning and remove the grammatical errors present in the original version.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and makes sense in context. It uses the past tense correctly ("donated") and has a clear subject ("we"), verb ("donated"), and object ("wire"). The prepositional phrases "for the convicts" and "to build cages with" provide additional information about the purpose of the action. There are no grammatical errors, such as missing punctuation marks, misspelled words, incorrect word order, or misused homophones. Therefore, I can confirm that the sentence "We donated wire for the convicts to build cages with." is indeed correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The negation in this sentence is incorrect. Instead of "won't have," it should be "don't have" or "doesn't have," depending on whether the subject is plural or singular.	I don't have some money. Alternatively, if the subject is singular, the corrected sentence would be: She doesn't have some money.
0	The sentence as written contains a pronoun ("somebody") without an explicit antecedent, making it unclear who is being referred to. This can be corrected by specifying the person or thing being looked for, such as "Do you believe the claim that the lost hiker was looking for shelter?"	Do you believe the claim that the lost hiker was looking for shelter?
0	The sentence contains a pronoun ambiguity error. It is unclear who "he" is trying to force to give money to "her". A more clear version of the sentence would be: "He (name) tried to force me to give her (name) any money."	I don't expect you to believe that John tried to force me to give Mary any money.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "That," which refers to something previously mentioned. The verb "must have pleased" correctly uses the past perfect tense to indicate a completed action before another completed action. The pronoun "somebody" agrees in number with its implied antecedent, making it grammatically correct as well.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The pronoun "himself" is a reflexive pronoun, which refers back to the subject of the sentence. In this case, the subject is "I", so the reflexive pronoun should refer back to the subject, not the object ("Winston"). Therefore, the correct form would be "I talked about him to Winston".	I talked about him to Winston.
0	The first clause of the sentence contains a punctuation error and a word order issue. In the first clause, there should be no comma after "wanted" because it separates two independent clauses without using a conjunction. Additionally, subject-auxiliary inversion ("did") should occur only in questions; therefore, the second clause should read as follows: "but the fuzz didn't worry her".	The sentence should read: "That the fuzz wanted to worry John, but it didn't worry Mary."
0	The verb tense agreement between the two clauses is incorrect. In the first clause, "work" is in the third person singular present tense ("will be working"), while in the second clause, "will be working" is used for a hypothetical situation. Instead, use "works" to maintain consistency in verb tense throughout the sentence.	The sentence should read as follows: "I'll work on it if Sam works on it."
0	The verb "goes" does not agree with its subject "me and my friend," which is plural. The correct form of the verb should be "go."	The sentence should read: "My friend and I go to the park every weekend."
0	The preposition "with" should be followed by an object, but here it is being incorrectly used with another preposition "for". To make this sentence grammatically correct, we need to combine these two phrases into one using a conjunction such as "and": "Here's a knife for you to cut up the onions with."	Here's a knife for you to cut up the onions with.
0	The sentence contains a mistake in the use of double negatives. In English grammar, we typically avoid using two negative words in one clause because they can create confusion and unclear meaning. Here, 'which not' creates a double negative after 'sick.' To fix it, we could say 'Fluffy is sick, which not everyone knows,' or better yet, rephrase it as 'Fluffy is sick, although not everyone knows about it.'	Fluffy is sick, although not everyone knows about it.
0	The sentence "Maxwell is quite a doctor" is grammatically incorrect because of the word "quite". In this context, "quite" implies that Maxwell has some qualities of a doctor but does not fully meet the definition of being one. However, since we know from the sentence that Maxwell actually is a doctor, it would be more appropriate to use an adjective such as "good", "excellent", or "skilled" instead.	The sentence should be corrected to say "Maxwell is an excellent doctor" or "Maxwell is a skilled doctor" depending on how well he performs his job.
0	There is a superfluous comma after "tall" which creates confusion about whether it refers to both women being tall or just the older one. Additionally, there is another unnecessary comma before "and". These errors create ambiguity and disrupt the flow of the sentence.	The younger woman might have been tall and the older one definitely was blond.
0	There is a punctuation error in the sentence. The comma after "blond" before "Sheila" is unnecessary and makes the sentence hard to read. It would be better written as two separate sentences or joined by a conjunction such as "but" or "and". Additionally, it's more common to use commas to separate items in a list only when there are three or more items. In this case, since there are only two items ("tall" and "blond"), no commas are needed.	"Sally is tall and may be blond. Sheila is short and definitely is blond."
0	The verb "try" should be followed by a base form of the verb, so it should be "I have to finish trying to grade..." instead. Also, there's no need for an article before "papers".	The sentence should read as follows - "I have to try to finish grading papers."
0	There is a repetition of the preposition "for" which makes the sentence incorrect. Also, the verb tense used in the second part of the sentence doesn't match the first part.	The socks are ready for you to put on.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and the word "sonatas" correctly agrees with its plural subject "it is easy to play". Sonata is a piece of music for one instrument, usually a piano, so it makes sense to use it in this context.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect because of the missing article before "sonatas". It should be either "the" or "this", depending on whether we're referring to specific sonatas or just any sonata in general.	This violin is difficult to play *the* sonatas on. OR This violin is difficult to play sonatas on.
0	The sentence is a fragment because it lacks a main verb. Also, there is a missing conjunction between "my father" and what follows it. A corrected version could be: "My mother is easy to please; she pleases my father and..."	My mother is easy to please. She pleased my father and...
0	The sentence contains a comma splice error, which occurs when two independent clauses are incorrectly joined by a comma. Here, "Poor Bill" and "it had started to rain and he had no umbrella" are both independent clauses and must be separated either by a period, semicolon, or conjunction.	Poor Bill; it had started to rain and he had no umbrella. Alternatively, "Poor Bill because it had started to rain and he had no umbrella." would also be grammatically correct.
0	The second sentence "that robbery" does not make sense without additional context. It seems to be missing a subject and verb. This makes the entire statement unclear and difficult to understand.	The sentence could potentially be corrected as follows: "That the cops spoke to the janitor about the robbery yesterday is terrible." However, I would need more information on what exactly is being referred to as 'terrible' before making any definitive judgments.
0	The sentence contains multiple errors in subject-verb agreement as well as pronoun reference. In the first part of the sentence, 'Every student' is singular, so it requires a singular verb form such as 'is'. However, 'and he wears socks' suggests that there might be more than one person being referred to, which would require a plural verb form such as 'are'. Moreover, the use of 'he' without specifying who it refers to can lead to confusion about whom the statement applies to. Therefore, the sentence needs correction for clarity and grammatical accuracy.	Each student is a swinger who wears socks. Or, alternatively, if referring specifically to males: Every male student is a swinger; each one wears socks.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It has a clear subject ("that girl"), verb ("was given"), and object ("my binoculars"). The possessive pronoun "my" correctly indicates ownership of the noun it modifies, "binoculars". The preposition "by" introduces the agent who performed the action of giving. All of these elements work together to form a complete and coherent thought.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and understandable. There are no spelling errors, punctuation errors, or word usage errors. The verb tense is consistent, and the subject-verb agreement is correct.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It uses the subjunctive mood correctly to express a hypothetical situation ("should work" implies that working in a delicatessen is a recommendation for someone who doesn't hate food). Additionally, the sentence has proper subject-verb agreement, parallel structure, and word choice.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The pronoun "his" in this context can be misleading as it assumes all people who talk in their sleep after buying something on credit are male. To make this sentence grammatically correct and inclusive, we could replace "his" with the gender-neutral term "their": "Everybody around here who ever buys anything on credit talks in their sleep."	Everybody around here who ever buys anything on credit talks in their sleep.
0	The subject of the sentence is "I," which is a singular first-person pronoun. However, the verb form used after the subject ("can't remember") is negative contraction of cannot, which is typically used for plural subjects or formal second person singular subjects. In this case, since the subject is singular, we need to use the singular form of the auxiliary verb "do" before "remember". Therefore, the correct form would be "I don't remember." However, the rest of the sentence has another issue. We cannot say "the name of somebody", because "somebody" itself means "a person unknown or unspecified". Instead, we must say "the name of someone".	I don't remember the name of someone who had misgivings.
0	The sentence contains a grammatical error. It should be "No writer nor playwright meets in Vienna" instead of "No writer, and no playwright, meets in Vienna". In this case, we use "nor" instead of "and", because both "writer" and "playwright" are negative ideas connected by "no". Additionally, there shouldn't be a comma between "writer" and "nor playwright".	The sentence I provided earlier can be corrected as follows: "No writer nor playwright meets in Vienna."
0	The sentence contains a grammatical error. It should be "No writer nor playwright **meets** in Vienna" or "No writer nor playwright **meet** in Vienna". Since both subjects are plural ("writers" and "playwrights"), we need to use the plural form of the verb "to meet", which is "meet". In this case, since only one person is mentioned, it would be more appropriate to use the singular form "meets"; however, because there's an 'or' connection between two nouns ('writer' and 'playwright'), the verb must agree with the closest subject - hence, "meet" is preferred here over "meets".	Either no writer nor any playwright meets in Vienna or No writer nor playwright meet in Vienna.
0	The sentence contains a double negative ("is not" and "any"), which can lead to confusion about the intended meaning. It would be better to use a positive subject and verb, followed by a negative word such as "not" or "never," for clarity. In addition, there's no need of comma after "student". So here it creates ambiguity whether it refers to all students or specific one.	It is not certain that I will marry any student.
1	The sentence "Felicia kicked the ball off the bench" is grammatically correct. Here, 'kicked' is a past tense verb which indicates the action performed by the subject 'Felicia'. Also, the object of the sentence is 'the ball', and 'off the bench' describes where the action took place or what happened to the ball after it got kicked. Hence, there are no grammatical errors in this sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "I sent the package halfway around the world" is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple sentence structure with a subject ("I"), an auxiliary verb ("sent") and an object ("the package"). Additionally, the adverbial phrase "halfway around the world" correctly modifies the verb by indicating where the action took place.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence "Sam gave the ball out of the basket" is grammatically incorrect because it uses a preposition ("out of") to describe the location where something was given from instead of using a prepositional phrase describing the direction or destination of the action. A more appropriate way to express this idea would be "Sam passed the ball out of the basket," which makes clear that he threw it towards someplace outside of the basket rather than simply giving it while standing near the basket.	Sam passed the ball out of the basket.
1	The sentence "Sam offered the ball out of the basket" is grammatically correct. Here, 'offered' is the past tense of the verb 'offer', which means to give something to someone else willingly. 'The ball' is a noun serving as the direct object of the sentence, receiving the action of the verb. Both 'out' and 'of the basket' modify wherefrom the action originated; thus they act adverbially. This structure creates a clear meaning without any grammatical errors.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Park Square has a festive air" is grammatically correct. There are no spelling errors, punctuation errors, or grammatical errors in the sentence. The subject of the sentence ("Park Square") is clearly identified, and the verb ("has") agrees with it in number. Additionally, the adjective ("festive") accurately describes the noun ("air").	The sentence is already correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple subject ("the worker") and a predicate verb ("will have"). The tense of the verb indicates future time. There is also a direct object ("a job"), which completes the meaning of the sentence by telling us what the worker will have.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence contains a pronoun error. The second person singular pronoun "you" needs to be in agreement with its antecedent "no one," which is singular. Therefore, we need to use the third person singular form of the verb "can forgive."	No one can forgive that comment to you. This should be changed to: "No one can forgive such a comment to you."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and uses appropriate punctuation. It also follows a logical sequence of events.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and conveys a clear meaning. There are no punctuation errors, subject-verb agreement issues, or incorrect verb tenses.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "lend" requires a direct object followed by "to" and the indirect object. In this case, "the book" is the direct object and "Tony" is the indirect object, so they need to be switched around for the sentence to be grammatically correct. Additionally, there shouldn't be a space before the word "partway".	I lent partway the book to Tony. (incorrect) OR I lent Tony the book partway. (correct)
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple sentence structure where the subject ("the farmer") performs the action ("loaded") on the direct object ("the cart"). Additionally, we have a prepositional phrase ("with apples") which describes how the loading occurred. There are no grammatical errors such as tense agreement issues, pronoun-antecedent disagreements, incorrect verb forms, misplaced modifiers, etc.	The sentence is already correct.
0	In this context, "dump" suggests that the contents of the cart were discarded carelessly, which is unlikely to be true for a cart full of valuable produce such as apples. A more appropriate verb might be "unloaded," "emptied," or simply "put down."	The farmer unloaded the cart with apples.
0	The verb 'carved' does not agree with its subject 'Martha'. Since 'Martha' is singular, the past tense of the verb should be 'carved', but it requires an object to complete the meaning. In this case, 'baby' cannot be the object because it would imply something terrible. A more appropriate wording could be 'Martha carved a wooden toy for the baby.'	Martha carved a wooden toy for the baby.
1	In this sentence, the verb "cuts" correctly agrees with its subject "the bread," which is singular. Additionally, the word order is correct and there are no missing or extra words. Therefore, this sentence is grammatically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "broke" does not make sense in this context because it implies causing damage to something, but fingers cannot be broken in this way. A more appropriate verb would be "hurt" or "injured". Also, the preposition "on" is incorrect; it should be "her finger" instead of "the finger".	Janet hurt Bill's finger.
1	The sentence "Janet broke the cup" is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("Janet"), a verb ("broke") and an object ("the cup"). There are no spelling errors or awkward phrasings.	The sentence is already correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct and uses a standard word order for simple sentences in English (subject + verb + object): "The visitor" is the subject, "rang" is the verb, and "the bell" is the object of the sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence is missing a clear subject and verb to express what is happening. Also, if "free" is meant to be used as an adverb here, it needs to modify a verb, but there isn't one provided. A more complete sentence would be something like "We freed ourselves" or "We broke free".	We broke free.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and can be used in most contexts without issue. It follows a standard subject-verb-object structure ("that movie" as the subject, "shocks" as the verb, and "people" as the object), has appropriate tense agreement, and uses common vocabulary and grammar rules.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "That movie always shocks" is grammatically correct. It consists of a subordinating conjunction ("that"), a noun ("movie"), and a verb in third person singular present tense form ("shocks"). There is no subject-verb agreement error, punctuation mistake, or other grammatical issues in this sentence. Therefore, it can be considered as grammatically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The subject of a sentence must always be followed by a verb. In this case, the subject ("Sharon") is present, but there is no verb directly following it. A proper sentence would require a helping verb such as "has" or "is," or simply "comes" to complete the predicate. For example, a grammatically correct version could read "Sharon has come to the room" or "Sharon comes to the room often."	The corrected sentence is: "Sharon comes to the room."
1	The sentence "Bill sent a package to Tom" is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("Bill"), a verb ("sent") and an object ("a package"). Additionally, it includes a prepositional phrase ("to Tom") which indicates where the package was sent. All of these elements combine to form a complete thought, making this sentence grammatically sound.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and makes sense semantically. It follows a clear subject-verb-object structure and uses appropriate vocabulary to convey meaning. There are no spelling errors or punctuation issues.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "He turned into a frog" is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("he"), a verb ("turned") in past tense, and an object ("a frog").	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "I mixed the sugar into the butter" is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("I"), an auxiliary verb ("mixed", which shows past tense), a direct object ("the sugar") and a prepositional phrase ("into the butter"). All of these elements work together to form a complete thought, making it a proper sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence is incorrect because people throw objects such as balls or frisbees, not fences. Additionally, "the" before "fence" suggests that a specific fence has been mentioned previously, which is not the case here. A more appropriate preposition to use would be "at," indicating that Brian threw the stick at the fence.	Brian threw the stick at the fence.
1	The sentence follows standard English grammar rules and there are no spelling errors. Therefore, it can be understood by a native speaker without any confusion.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "We investigated the area for bombs" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "we," which is a plural noun referring to the investigators. The verb "investigated" agrees with the plural subject and is in the past tense. The preposition "for" introduces the prepositional phrase "for bombs," indicating what the investigation entailed. The object of the preposition is "bombs," a plural noun. Therefore, there are no grammatical errors in this sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and conveys a clear meaning. The subject of the sentence ("I") is doing the action ("sensed"), which is indicated by the past tense verb form "sensed". The object of the sentence is "his eagerness", which follows correctly after the verb.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence ("the volunteers") is clearly identified, and the verb ("praised") agrees with it in number. Additionally, there is a prepositional phrase ("in the volunteers") that modifies the noun to specify where the praise was directed. All elements of the sentence function correctly within their roles.	The sentence is already correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("the earth"), a linking verb ("was"), and a complement clause ("believed to be round"). The tense of the verb is past, indicating that people used to believe that the Earth was round in the past.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Sarah smiled a charming smile" is grammatically correct. There are no spelling errors, punctuation errors, or grammatical errors in the sentence. Additionally, the syntax of the sentence is also correct as it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Sandra beamed a cheerful welcome" is grammatically correct. There are no spelling errors, punctuation errors, or grammatical errors in the sentence. Additionally, the verb tense is consistent throughout the sentence, and the subject-verb agreement is also maintained.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It uses the past participle of the verb "live" to form a common idiomatic expression meaning that someone has enjoyed life and experienced many things.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "lift" requires an object to complete its meaning, but there is no direct object in this sentence. Additionally, the preposition "onto" suggests a directional movement towards something, so it needs to be followed by a noun or pronoun indicating what is being lifted onto the table. A more grammatically correct version of this sentence would be "Paperback books lift easily onto the table," although this still implies that the books themselves have agency, which may not be the intended meaning. To clarify that someone or something else is lifting the books, one could say "One can easily lift paperback books onto the table" or "It's easy to lift paperback books onto the table."	One can easily lift paperback books onto the table.
0	In present tense, we use "lift" as the verb when referring to one person or thing doing the action of lifting something up. However, if we're talking about multiple people or things collectively lifting something up, we need to add -s to make it "lifts". Additionally, since there seems to be no agent indicated here who did the lifting, a passive construction might work better by adding "were" before "lifted": "The books were lifted onto the table." Or, for active voice, "Someone lifted the books onto the table."	The books were lifted onto the table. OR Someone lifted the books onto the table.
0	The sentence is grammatically correct but semantically incorrect because it implies that Jessica put the boxes underneath the wagon rather than on top of it where they would typically be loaded.	Jessica loaded boxes onto the wagon.
1	The sentence "Jessica loaded boxes on the wagon" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Jessica," a proper noun in the nominative case. The verb is "loaded," which is in the past tense and agrees with the subject. Finally, the object of the preposition "on" is "the wagon," another proper noun in the definite article. Therefore, there are no grammatical errors in this sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Jessica crammed boxes at the truck" is grammatically correct. Here, "crammed" is a verb in past tense which means to pack something tightly into a container. It takes a direct object, in this case, "boxes". Also, "at the truck" correctly shows where the action took place. Therefore, there are no grammatical errors in this sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb 'butter' requires a direct object to complete its meaning. In this case, it should be 'Lora buttered the toast', where 'the toast' is the direct object of the verb 'buttered'. Without the direct object, the sentence is incomplete and incorrect grammatically.	Lora buttered the toast.
1	The sentence "Carla shoveled the walk" is grammatically correct. It consists of a proper subject ("Carla"), helping verb ("did"), main verb in past tense form ("shoveled") and object ("the walk"). There are no spelling errors, punctuation errors or word usage issues present in this sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Nora sent the book" follows standard English syntax rules and does not contain any grammatical errors. It has a clear subject ("Nora"), verb ("sent"), and object ("the book"). Therefore, it can be understood easily by native speakers of English.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Nora sent Peter the book" is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple sentence structure: subject ("Nora") + verb ("sent") + indirect object ("Peter") + direct object ("the book"). Each word is used correctly and spelled properly. There are no punctuation errors, run-on sentences, fragments, or other common grammatical issues.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Carla slid the book" is grammatically correct. It consists of a proper subject ("Carla"), verb ("slid") and object ("the book"). There are no spelling errors, punctuation issues, or grammatical problems such as incorrect tense, agreement between subject and verb, etc.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "slid" indicates past tense action, but there is no clear subject performing this action. Also, it is unclear what sliding at a book means.	The sentence could be corrected as follows: "Carla slipped on the book." This sentence has a clear subject ("Carla") and uses the appropriate verb form for slipping ("slipped"). Additionally, it specifies the cause of her slipping ("on the book").
1	The sentence "Amanda carried the package to Pamela" is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple sentence with a subject ("Amanda"), verb ("carried"), and object ("the package"). There are no spelling errors, punctuation errors, or grammatical errors.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence is incorrect because the subject of the sentence, "Packages," is plural while the verb, "drive," is singular. This results in a mismatch between the number agreement of the subject and the verb. In addition, packages cannot drive themselves; they need someone or something to drive them.	Trucks carrying packages drive easily to New York.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It consists of a subject ("the chair") and a verb ("pushed"), which makes it a complete thought. There is no need for additional information to make sense of the sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "We offered a job to her" is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple sentence with a subject ("we"), an auxiliary verb ("offered") and an object ("a job"). Additionally, it contains a prepositional phrase ("to her"). All elements are correctly used, so no grammatical errors can be found.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence "A job offered" is missing a subject and verb to form a complete thought. It's unclear who is offering the job or if someone has accepted it. In order for the sentence to be grammatically correct, it needs to have both a subject and a verb.	Someone offered me a job. OR I was offered a job.
1	The sentence "Brown presented a plaque to Jones" is grammatically correct. It contains a simple subject ("Brown"), a verb ("presented"), and an object ("a plaque"). Additionally, it includes a prepositional phrase ("to Jones") which provides more information about the action of presenting. All the elements are arranged correctly according to English grammar rules.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence follows standard English grammar rules and has no spelling errors.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Carmen obtained the spare part at the hardware store" is grammatically correct. There are no spelling errors, punctuation mistakes, subject-verb agreement issues, or incorrect word usage.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Michelle kept the desk with the papers" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Michelle," and the verb is "kept." The object of the verb is "the desk," which is modified by the prepositional phrase "with the papers." This construction indicates that Michelle retained possession of both the desk and the papers. No grammatical errors are present in this sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Frances hid the presents in the drawer" is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("Frances"), a verb ("hid") and an object ("the presents"). The prepositional phrase "in the drawer" modifies the verb by telling us where she hid the presents. There are no grammatical errors in this sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct and makes sense in context. The subject of the sentence ("the needle") performs the action denoted by the verb ("poked"), which has a clear object ("the cloth"). There are no grammatical errors or awkward phrasings to distract from the meaning of the sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Carrie touched that cat" is grammatically correct. It consists of a proper noun ("Carrie") functioning as the subject, followed by the past tense verb "touched," which agrees with the singular subject in number. Finally, there's a demonstrative determiner ("that") modifying the noun "cat," serving as the object of the sentence. No grammatical errors can be found here.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Herman whipped the sugar and the cream" is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple sentence with a subject ("Herman") and a verb ("whipped"), followed by two objects ("the sugar" and "the cream"). Although it might be more appropriate to say that Herman whipped "together" the sugar and the cream if he combined them into one substance, such as when making whipped cream, the sentence is still grammatical without this preposition.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Linda taped the picture to the wall" is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple sentence with a subject ("Linda"), verb ("taped") and object ("the picture"). There are no spelling errors or punctuation issues.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Linda taped the picture onto the wall" is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple sentence with a subject ("Linda"), verb ("taped") and object ("the picture"). Additionally, it uses the preposition "onto" to indicate where the action occurred, which is also used correctly in this context.	The sentence is already correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "the child and her mother," which is a compound subject connected by the conjunction "and." Both "child" and "mother" are singular nouns, so we use the plural verb form "clung" to agree with the subjects. Additionally, using the past tense correctly indicates that the action occurred in the past.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "This flyer and that flyer differ" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "this flyer and that flyer," which is a plural noun phrase. The verb "differ" agrees with the plural subject. Therefore, there is no grammatical error in this sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The word "apart" is unnecessary in this context and makes the sentence grammatically incorrect. It appears as though it's intended to mean "in their differences," but without a preposition such as "by" or "in," using "apart" here is redundant and incorrect. A better way to say this would be "This flyer and that flyer differ."	The sentence I provided earlier ("This flyer and that flyer differ.") is already correct.
0	The subject of the sentence is "the jeweler," which is a singular noun. However, the verb "scribbled" is in the past tense but does not agree with the subject in number; it should be "scribed" to agree with the singular subject. Additionally, there seems to be some confusion about what exactly the jeweler is supposed to have scribbled on the contract - his own name? This could use clarification for clarity.	The jeweler signed his name on the contract, or The jeweler scratched out an unfavorable clause in the contract with his own handwriting, depending on the intended meaning.
0	The verb "grew" does not fit grammatically with its subject "the gardener". Plants grow; people cannot grow other things directly. A more appropriate word would be "cultivated", which means to take care of something so it grows well. Also, we usually say 'grow from' instead of 'grow into'. So a better way to put this would be:	The gardener cultivated that acorn into an oak tree. OR The gardener grew that acorn into an oak sapling.
1	The sentence "I shaped a loaf" is grammatically correct. It consists of a subject ("I"), a verb ("shaped") in past tense, and an object ("a loaf"). All elements are used correctly to convey a complete thought.	The sentence is already correct.
0	This sentence is missing a direct object, which is necessary to complete the meaning of the verb "amuse". In this case, we need to know what specifically the children found amusing. Without this information, the sentence is grammatically incomplete.	The children amused us with their silly jokes.
1	The sentence "Susan whispered the news" is grammatically correct. It contains a proper subject ("Susan"), a verb in past tense ("whispered") which agrees with the subject, and a direct object ("the news"). All elements of the sentence have been used correctly to form a complete thought.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Susan whispered at Rachel" is grammatically correct. In this sentence, the subject ("Susan") is performing the action of whispering towards the object ("Rachel"). This construction follows standard English syntax rules for transitive verbs (verbs that take a direct object), so no corrections are necessary.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Ellen said that melons were selling well" is grammatically correct. It has a clear subject ("Ellen"), a verb ("said") linking to a dependent clause, and another verb ("were selling") linking to its own subject ("melons"). This structure follows standard rules for English grammar and shows no spelling errors.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence is missing a noun after "about" to make it grammatically complete.	Ellen said something about the present conditions.
1	The sentence follows the standard structure of an English sentence (Subject-Verb-Object), where the subject ("Ellen") performs the action ("warned") upon the object ("Helen"). Additionally, it contains a prepositional phrase ("against skating on thin ice") which modifies the verb. All words are spelled correctly, and there are no punctuation errors.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Cynthia nibbled on the carrot" is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("Cynthia"), a verb ("nibbled") and an object ("the carrot"). The word "on" is used correctly as a preposition indicating the manner of eating.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Cynthia chewed" is grammatically correct. It consists of a proper noun ("Cynthia") as the subject and a past tense verb ("chewed"). There are no spelling errors, punctuation marks are used correctly, and there is nothing missing from the sentence to make it unclear or confusing. Therefore, I would rate this sentence as being grammatically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence follows standard English grammar rules and has a clear subject ("Paul") and verb ("laughed"). There are no spelling errors or awkward phrasings to suggest incorrectness.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The error in this sentence lies in the object of the verb "wink". In standard English, we do not wink our lips; instead, we might bite, purse, or lick them. Winking refers to quickly closing and opening one's eyes as a gesture.	Linda bit her lip.
0	The verb 'pound' requires a direct object to complete its meaning, but in the given sentence, there is no noun or pronoun after 'pounding' to serve as the direct object. Instead, 'me' is used as the indirect object, which is incorrect. Therefore, the sentence is grammatically wrong.	The sentence should be corrected as follows - "My heart is pounding in my chest" or "My heart is pounding inside me".
1	The sentence "Sharon fainted from hunger" is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple sentence structure where the subject ("Sharon") is followed by the verb ("fainted") and the prepositional phrase ("from hunger") provides additional information about the cause of fainting.	The sentence is already correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct and makes sense in context. There is a subject ("the witch"), an action verb ("poisoned") and an object ("the children").	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "A grandfather clock ticked in the hallway" is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("a grandfather clock"), a verb ("ticked") and a prepositional phrase ("in the hallway") which functions as an adverbial of place, specifying where the action described by the verb took place. All words are spelled correctly and there are no punctuation errors.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "squeak" is typically an intransitive verb, meaning it does not take a direct object. In this case, the sentence attempts to use "the door" as a direct object of "squeak," which is incorrect. Instead, one could say "I squeezed **through** the door" or "The door squeaked (as I opened it)" to convey the intended meaning.	The sentence should be either "I squeezed through the door" or "The door squeaked (as I opened it)," depending on context.
1	The sentence "Over the fire there bubbled a fragrant stew" is grammatically correct. There are no spelling errors, punctuation marks are used correctly, and subject-verb agreement as well as verb tense consistency are maintained throughout the sentence. Moreover, the word order follows standard English syntax rules.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and conveys a clear meaning. It follows the standard structure of subject-verb-predicate, where 'soaring temperatures' serves as the subject, 'are predicted' functions as the verb, and 'for this weekend' acts as the predicate indicating when these soaring temperatures will occur.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The word "fort" does not fit in this context because it typically refers to a military stronghold, which would not have flags fluttering on it. Instead, we would expect to see flags at a building such as a city hall or school. Therefore, the sentence is factually incorrect even if the grammar and spelling are correct.	The front of the city hall fluttered with many flags.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple sentence with the subject ("the voices") and the verb ("echoed"), describing the action performed by the subject. The word "in" indicates the location where the action takes place, which is expressed by the noun phrase "the hall". All elements are correctly arranged according to English grammar rules.	The voices echoed in the hall. (The sentence is already correct.)
1	This sentence is grammatically correct and follows standard English syntax rules. It contains a subject ("the stream"), a verb ("twists"), and a prepositional phrase ("through the valley") which modifies the action of the verb. All words are spelled correctly and punctuation is appropriate for the context.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in this sentence. The singular subject "opportunity" requires a singular verb form; however, "presented" is the past tense of "present," which is a transitive verb requiring an object ("it") to complete its meaning. In other words, we can't just say "X presented"; instead, it must be "X presented Y". Here, there is no direct object, so a linking verb such as "was" would work better than "presented":	A wonderful opportunity presented itself yesterday. Alternatively, one could also say "A wonderful opportunity arose yesterday", which avoids the need for a linking verb entirely.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "a wonderful opportunity," which is singular, so the verb must also be singular. In this case, the past tense verb "presented" correctly matches the singular subject. Furthermore, there are no punctuation errors and all words are spelled correctly.	The sentence is already correct.
0	In present tense, we use 'jumps' instead of 'jumped'. The past tense would be appropriate if the sentence were written as "Out of the box jumped a little white rabbit **yesterday**.", for example. However, without any context indicating past action, it is more likely to follow standard usage by saying "A little white rabbit jumps out of the box" or simply "A little white rabbit is jumping out of the box".	A little white rabbit jumps out of the box.
1	The sentence "Penny skated around the rink" is grammatically correct. It contains a proper subject ("Penny"), a past tense verb ("skated") and a prepositional phrase ("around the rink"). The word order is also appropriate for a simple declarative sentence in English.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Jackie accompanied Rose" follows standard English grammar rules for subject-verb agreement, word order, and punctuation. There are no spelling errors present either.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in this sentence. The word "information" is plural, so it requires a plural verb. Therefore, we need to use "were" instead of "was". Additionally, there is no article ("a" or "the") before "many", which makes the meaning unclear. A more appropriate way to say this would be "Much information was provided." or "Many pieces of information were provided.", depending on what the speaker wants to convey.	Much information was provided.
0	The word "advice" is uncountable, so we cannot use it with numbers or determiners such as "many". We can say "John offers much advice", or "John offers a lot of advice".	John offers a lot of advice.
1	The sentence follows the rules of subject-verb agreement, word order, and has a clear meaning. It also uses comparatives correctly to compare two cakes.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "eat" requires a base form after it in this context, so "less" is incorrect here; instead, we need to use "fewer". Also, there is no punctuation mark between "cake" and "and", which would make the sentence harder to read if used in running text.	We recommend eating fewer cakes and pastries.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and conveys a clear meaning. The subject of the sentence ("I") is followed by a verb tense that indicates past experience or observation ("saw"), which is appropriate for expressing that the speaker witnessed something happen previously. The object of the sentence ("that gas can explode") contains a noun clause functioning as the direct object, providing additional information about what the speaker observed. Overall, there are no grammatical errors or awkward phrasing to be corrected.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "He washed her" is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple sentence with a subject ("he") and a verb ("washed"). The verb agrees with its subject in number, and the object ("her") clearly refers to someone who received the action of washing from the subject. There are no grammatical errors or awkward phrasings.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "wash" needs to agree with its subject in number, so it should be "Washes you!" if we're referring to a singular subject. However, without context, I assume the intended meaning here is likely "you wash," as in instructing someone else to wash themselves. In any case, the original sentence requires correction.	You wash.
0	The sentence is missing a noun after "no". Without knowing what object or concept is being referred to, it's impossible for the sentence to be grammatically complete.	The sentence should read "They have no idea," or some other noun should follow "no" to make the meaning clear.
0	The subject of the sentence is "some," which requires a plural verb to agree with it. However, the verb used here is "is" instead of "are". Therefore, the sentence is grammatically incorrect.	Some of my jobs are in jeopardy.
0	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in this sentence. In this case, "policeman" is a singular noun, so it requires a singular verb form such as "was." However, the sentence uses the plural verb form "met," which creates the disagreement. A correct version of this sentence would use the singular verb form "was" to agree with the singular subject "the policeman": "It was the policeman who met several young students in the park last night."	It was the policeman who met several young students in the park last night.
0	The verb tense is incorrect in this sentence. It should be "did the policeman meet IN the park?" if we want to keep the past simple tense, or "is the policeman meeting in the park?" if we want to change it to present continuous.	Did the policeman meet in the park? (corrected to past simple tense) or Is the policeman meeting in the park? (corrected to present continuous tense)
1	The sentence "John put old books in the box" is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("John"), a verb ("put") in past tense which agrees with the subject, and two objects ("old books", "the box"). The word order is also correct following standard English syntax rules.	The sentence is already correct.
0	This sentence is missing a verb. A proper sentence needs both a subject ("the monkeys") and a predicate (a verb and any accompanying objects or modifiers), but here we only have a noun phrase without a corresponding action or state-of-being for the monkeys to be doing or experiencing. In order to fix this error, one possible solution would be to add a verb such as "are" to make it read: "The monkeys are proud of their leader."	The monkeys are proud of their leader.
0	The sentence is missing a word after "very". It seems like the speaker is trying to describe someone's sound but didn't finish their thought. A complete version of this sentence could be something like "John sounded very tired" or "John sounded very angry", for example.	John sounded very tired.
0	The sentence is a fragment because it lacks a main verb, which makes it grammatically incomplete. A complete sentence requires both a subject and a predicate (a verb). In this case, "I" is the subject, but there is no main verb for the subject to perform an action on or have an action done to it. Additionally, the word "should" functions as a helping modal verb here, requiring another verb to form a complete thought. Therefore, adding a suitable verb would make the sentence grammatically correct.	I don't know if I should agree or disagree.
1	The sentence "John bought a book on the table" is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple sentence with a subject ("John"), a verb ("bought"), and an object ("a book"). Additionally, it includes a prepositional phrase ("on the table") to provide more information about where the action took place.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and the word "fool" is used appropriately as an insulting term for someone who lacks judgment or sense. Therefore, there is nothing wrong with the sentence from a grammatical or semantic perspective.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It has a simple past tense verb ("forgot") to express a completed action in the past, followed by a noun clause ("how good beer tastes"). This type of construction is often used when we want to talk about our lack of memory regarding something specific.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and makes sense in context.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "remain" should be used with a state of being rather than as a transitive verb meaning 'to cause something to stay'. In addition, it would sound more natural to say "he has remained" instead of "is remained". Also, there is no need for the preposition "by" after "remained", since the subject performing the action is expressed through the reflexive pronoun "himself".	He remains a good friend to me.
0	The verb 'eat' must agree with its subject in number. In this case, the subject 'John' is singular, so the verb should also be singular ('eats'). Additionally, the noun 'noodle' requires a determiner such as 'his', but it appears without one in the original sentence. A corrected version of the sentence would read: "John eats his noodles quietly."	John eats his noodles quietly.
1	The sentence "A smith hammered the metal" is grammatically correct. It has a subject ("A smith"), a verb ("hammered") and an object ("the metal"). There are no spelling errors, punctuation errors, or other grammatical issues.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Sandy removed her ballet shoes" is grammatically correct. It has a clear subject ("Sandy"), verb ("removed") and object ("her ballet shoes"). The sentence also follows standard English syntax rules for word order.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and conveys a clear meaning. There are no errors in subject-verb agreement, verb tense consistency, word usage, punctuation, or spelling.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and demonstrates proper tense usage. It also uses appropriate prepositions and articles.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Everyone hoped that she would sing" follows the standard structure of a sentence in English which includes a subject ("Everyone"), a subordinating conjunction ("that"), a predicate verb ("hoped") and its complement ("she would sing"). All words are spelled correctly, all punctuation marks are used appropriately according to their roles, and there are no grammatical errors such as incorrect agreement between subjects and verbs or wrong use of tenses.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "This proved a decisive factor" is grammatically correct. It contains a simple subject ("this") and a predicate verb ("proved"), followed by a noun clause complement ("a decisive factor"). There are no grammatical errors such as misspellings, incorrect word order, missing punctuation marks, etc.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb 'devour' means to eat something quickly and eagerly because you enjoy it very much. It implies that what is being eaten is food. A doughnut is a type of sweet snack, so it can be considered as food. However, using 'devour' for a doughnut seems quite exaggerated and humorous since people usually do not consume doughnuts in such a manner. Instead, words like ate, consumed, or even gobbled up would be more appropriate choices here.	The crocodile ate the doughnut.
1	The sentence "John is afraid of Bill" follows the standard structure for expressing a simple fear relationship between two people, where we have a subject ("John"), followed by a verb ("is") and its complement ("afraid"), and finally the object of the preposition ("of") plus another noun ("Bill"). Therefore, it's grammatically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence is missing a preposition to complete the location of where "John put" something. A possible correction could be "under" if there's an object being placed beneath the tub, so the corrected version would read as follows: "John put something under the bathtub".	John put something under the bathtub.
1	The sentence "John placed Kim behind the garage" is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple sentence structure with a subject ("John"), verb ("placed"), indirect object ("Kim") and prepositional phrase ("behind the garage"). All elements are used correctly without any spelling errors.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence is missing a verb to complete its meaning. It seems like it's trying to express some sort of dependency between "Kim" and "Sandy," but without a proper verb connecting them, the sentence is grammatically incorrect.	The sentence should be either "Kim depends on Sandy" or "Sandy depends on Kim," depending on who is relying on whom.
1	The sentence "John put the book in the box" is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("John"), a verb ("put") in past tense, and two objects ("the book", "the box"). There are no spelling errors or awkward phrasings.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and makes sense in its current form.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "John regards Bill as a good friend" is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("John"), a verb ("regards"), and an object ("Bill"). The phrase "as a good friend" functions as an adverbial of reason, explaining why John has that attitude towards Bill. There's no grammatical mistake in the sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Kim put in the box" is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple sentence with a subject ("Kim") and a verb ("put"), followed by an object ("the box"). There are no spelling errors or awkward phrasings to suggest incorrect usage.	The sentence is already correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple subject ("the chickens") and a predicate ("seem fond of the farmer"). The verb tense is consistent throughout the sentence, and all elements agree in number.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence follows all of the necessary grammatical rules for standard English, so it is a grammatically correct sentence.	The rules require that the executives be polite. The sentence is already correct.
0	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in this sentence. The verb "was" does not agree with its plural subject "Fred" and "those people". It should be "Those people were unpopular; they nominated Bill."	Those people, who were unpopular, nominated Bill.
1	The sentence "They were taking a hard look at possible FTA" is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple tense verb phrase ("were taking") followed by the preposition "at" and its object "possible FTA," which stands for Free Trade Agreement. There are no apparent spelling errors, subject-verb agreement issues, or other grammatical problems in this sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The preposition 'against' is used incorrectly in this context. It seems like 'for' or 'in exchange for' would be more appropriate to indicate payment made for a specific object, i.e., the book.	John paid me for the book.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple subject ("the committee") and a verb tense that indicates future action ("will study"). Additionally, there is a direct object ("the feasibility") followed by a prepositional phrase ("of setting up") which further describes the direct object. Finally, there is another noun phrase ("a national computer network"), functioning as the goal of the proposed action. All these elements work together smoothly to form a coherent and complete thought.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "made" is a transitive verb, which means it requires a direct object to complete its meaning. In the sentence "We made them be rude," the subject "we" is making "them" do something, but what they are doing is expressed by the infinitive phrase "be rude," which does not function as a noun and cannot serve as the direct object of the verb "made." Instead, we need to use a noun or pronoun as the direct object after "made." For example, we could say "We made them angry" or "We made rudeness their habit."	We made them rude people.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and makes sense semantically. There are no spelling errors, punctuation marks are used correctly, and the word order follows standard English syntax rules.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "studying" should agree with its subject "Students," but it is present participle form which requires a helping verb to complete the predicate. Therefore, we need to use "study" instead as follows:	The sentence is already correct if we change "studying" to "study": "Students study Conrad's Heart of Darkness while at university."
0	The sentence is missing a determiner before the word "book". In English, we usually need to specify if something belongs to us ("my book"), if it's known to both speaker and listener ("the book"), or if it's one among several similar things ("a book"). Without a determiner, the sentence sounds incomplete.	I read some of the book. OR I read some of a book. OR I read my book. OR I read a book. (Depending on context.)
1	The sentence "Most of the fruit is rotten" is grammatically correct. The subject "most of the fruit" is plural, but it's being used with a singular verb "is" because we're treating the group as a single unit. This is a common construction in English known as a "collective noun".	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence "Neither of students failed" is incorrect because it lacks a determiner before "students". It should be "Neither of the students failed" or "Neither student failed", depending on whether there were only two students being referred to.	Neither of the students failed.
0	The verb "drank" does not agree with its subject "I". In present tense, we would say "I drink", but in past tense it should be "I drank". However, when using "some" to indicate a quantity, we need to use a plural noun after it, so instead of saying "some water", we should say "some water**s**". Therefore, the corrected sentence should read "I drank some **of the** water."	The sentence is already correct if we change it to "I drank some of the water."
0	The noun "hair" should be plural because it refers to many strands of gold-colored fibers on someone's head. Therefore, the correct form should be "golden hairs".	The sentence should read as follows: "It is a golden hair**s**.", indicating multiple strands instead of just one.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct and easy to understand. It has a clear subject ("the boy"), verb ("waived"), and object ("his father"). There is also appropriate use of prepositions ("in," "to") and articles ("the"). No changes need to be made.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The reflexive pronoun for a singular third-person subject should be "itself," not "it's." It appears there might have been confusion between the contraction "it's" (meaning "it is") and the reflexive form of the pronoun "it." Using the wrong word can change the meaning of the sentence and make it grammatically incorrect.	That dog is so ferocious, it even tried to bite itself.
0	The verb "washed" requires an object pronoun such as "him," "her," or "it," but instead, a reflexive pronoun "yourself" is used. This error occurs because people often mistakenly use a reflexive pronoun when they mean to use an objective pronoun.	He washed him/her/it.
0	The sentence "John is easy to please Kim" is grammatically incorrect because it lacks a preposition such as "for" after "please". Without the preposition, the sentence suggests that John himself is easily pleased by Kim rather than implying that he is easy for someone else to please.	The corrected sentence should be either "John is easy to please" or "John is easy to please for Kim", depending on the intended meaning.
0	The sentence is missing a noun after "intelligent". It seems that there is an implied subject which has been left out of the sentence. In order for this sentence to be grammatically complete, it would need to include a specific noun or pronoun as its subject. For example, "There seemed to be an intelligent student in class today" would be a grammatical completion of the original fragment.	The sentence should either have a specific subject added to make it grammatically complete, such as "there seemed to be an intelligent person," or else use more appropriate verb tense to convey the intended meaning without requiring an elided subject, such as "it seemed that he was being intelligent."
1	The sentence "John tried to please Stephen" is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple tense verb "tried" followed by an infinitive "to please". Both the subject "John" and the object "Stephen" are clearly identified. There are no spelling errors or misplaced words. Therefore, it's grammatically sound.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence is incorrect because people cannot be referred to as "fountains" metaphorically or otherwise. Fountains are inanimate objects while people are animate beings. Moreover, there seems to be no logical connection between believing someone to be a fountain and any context related to parks. It appears that the intended meaning of the sentence might have been distorted due to grammatical errors.	Either we thought John was sitting on a bench in the park, or he was playing near the fountain; however, it's unclear which one.
0	The subject of the sentence, "it", does not have a clear referent. In other words, it's unclear what "it" refers to. Additionally, there is no verb agreement between the plural noun "countries" and the singular form of the verb "leave".	The person tries to leave the country. Or: The dog tries to leave the yard. (In each case, I am assuming a specific context for "it.") Alternatively, if we want to maintain the use of "it," the corrected sentence would be: "It tries to leave the country," where "it" clearly refers to a single individual who has been mentioned earlier in the conversation or text. For example: "There is someone trying to cross the border without authorization. It tries to leave the country by hiding in a truck carrying produce."
1	The sentence "John tries to leave the country" is grammatically correct. It consists of a subject ("John"), an auxiliary verb ("tries") which expresses the present continuous tense, and an infinitive verb ("to leave"). Furthermore, the noun phrase "the country" serves as the direct object of the sentence. All elements are put together correctly so no correction is needed.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Under the bed seems to be a fun place to hide" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "under the bed," which is followed by the linking verb "seems" and the complement "a fun place to hide." There are no grammatical errors in this sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "is" does not agree in number with its subject "there is believed to be sheep". Since "sheep" is plural, the correct form of the verb should be "are", as in "There are believed to be sheep in the park."	There are believed to be sheep in the park.
0	The sentence contains a double modal error. In English, we cannot use both "would" and "will/shall" in the same verb tense. Here, "hope" indicates that the speaker will do something in the future, so it's incorrect to say "I hope to **would** study". Instead, the correct formulation would be "I hope to study", "I would hope to study", or "I hoped I would study".	I hope to study in France.
1	The sentence follows standard English grammar rules and has a clear subject ("John") and verb ("can kick"). It also uses appropriate tense to indicate future action.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "rain" is an impersonal verb that doesn't have a subject. It should be used in the following way: "It will rain tomorrow," instead of "John will rain tomorrow". Therefore, the original sentence is incorrect.	It will rain tomorrow.
0	The subject "there" does not require a verb ending in "-s," so using both "will" and "rain" is redundant. Additionally, we often use "expect" followed by a noun or pronoun and an infinitive verb, as in "We expect it to rain."	We expect it to rain.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and has a clear subject ("John"), verb ("was found"), and prepositional phrase ("in the office") which provides more information about where John was found.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence contains a verb form error. In English, we use the auxiliary verb "did" to ask questions about past simple tense. So, the correct form of the verb "to be" after "did" should be "be". However, it's ungrammatical to say "Did the child be...?" because we need to use the past participle form "been" instead of "be". Therefore, the correct question would be "Did the child been in the school?" but even so, it still sounds very awkward. A more natural way to express this idea would be "Was the child in school?" or "Did the child go to school?".	The sentence "Did the child been in the school?" needs to be corrected as either "Was the child in school?" or "Did the child go to school?" depending on what exactly the speaker wants to convey.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There is a simple subject ("it") followed by a verb in the past tense ("did rain"). Since there is no complement or adverbial clause included in the sentence, we understand it to mean that it wasn't raining during some unspecified time period in the past.	The sentence is already correct.
0	In modern English, we typically use do-support to form negations rather than adding "not" after the auxiliary verb. Therefore, a more natural way of expressing this idea would be "John doesn't want to leave the town." The original sentence is grammatically possible but sounds quite formal and old-fashioned.	John doesn't want to leave the town.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It contains two independent clauses ("Mary likes to tour art galleries" and "Bill hates to") connected by a coordinating conjunction ("but"). Each clause has a subject ("Mary" and "Bill") and a verb ("likes" and "hates"), so they can stand alone as complete thoughts. This structure follows the rules of standard English grammar.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "They needn't take this exam" is grammatically correct. The word "needn't" is a contraction of "do not need," which can be used to express that something is not necessary. In this case, it indicates that the subjects do not have to take the exam.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Ann may spend her vacation in Italy" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "Ann" is a proper noun and serves as the subject of the sentence. * "may spend" is the verb phrase in the present tense, indicating possibility or permission. In this context, it suggests that Ann has the option to spend her vacation in Italy. * "her" refers to Ann's possession of the vacation. * "vacation" is a common noun referring to a period of time spent away from work or school for leisure. * "in Italy" indicates the location where Ann might choose to spend her vacation. Overall, the sentence follows standard English grammar rules and contains no errors.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence follows the subject-verb agreement rule and uses proper punctuation. There are no grammatical errors or awkward phrasings.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is a question followed by a tag clause, which is used to confirm information or seek agreement from the listener. In this case, the main verb in the sentence is "has spent," and its subject is "George." Since "he" refers back to "George," the tag clause "hasn't he?" uses negative form to ask for confirmation about what has been said before. Therefore, the sentence is grammatically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence contains an error known as an incorrect use of a negative polarity item. In this case, "scarcely" has a negative meaning, so it's ungrammatical to use another negation such as "couldn't." Instead, we can say "he could scarcely do anything worth mentioning."	He could scarcely do anything worth mentioning (as a statesman).
1	The sentence "We never found any of the unicorns" is grammatically correct. The subject ("we") is plural, so it agrees with the verb ("found"), which is also in the past tense and matches the time frame established by the adverb "never." The object of the preposition "of" is "the unicorns," a plural noun modified by the definite article "the." Since the sentence follows all standard rules for English grammar, punctuation, and usage, no corrections are needed.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and there are no spelling errors.	The sentence is already correct. Confidence: 95%
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There is a noun ("somebody") followed by a verb ("struck"), which is in the past tense and agrees with the subject. The direct object of the sentence is "the unidentified victim," and there is a prepositional phrase modifying when the action took place, "during the early morning hours." All parts of speech are used correctly, so no corrections need to be made.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "The car was driven" is grammatically correct. It consists of a subject ("the car"), a helping verb ("was"), and a past participle form of the main verb ("driven"). The tense indicates a past action completed by someone else, which fits the meaning of the sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Ricky can be relied on" is grammatically correct. It follows a standard subject-verb-complement structure where "Ricky" serves as the subject, "can be relied" functions as the verb, and "on" introduces the prepositional complement. This construction correctly conveys the idea of trusting someone to follow through with their responsibilities.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The past participle of the verb "sleep" can be either "slept" or "has slept", depending on whether it's used in a passive voice construction ("the bed was slept in") or as part of a present perfect tense ("I have slept enough"). Therefore, the original sentence is grammatically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb tense used in the sentence does not agree with the intended meaning of the sentence. In present perfect tense, which would be appropriate for expressing a past action related to the current time ("has been" or "have been"), the auxiliary verb "to have" must precede the past participle form of the main verb. Here, "was" is the past simple form of "to be", but it doesn't make sense in context as there isn't any clear reference point in the past. Instead, if you want to say something has weight equal to one pound, use the following construction: "A pound in weight is what the book has".	A pound in weight is what the book has.
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect because it uses the word "who" instead of "whom," which is required for a direct object. In this case, "Tom" is the subject of the embedded question, so we need to use "whom" as the direct object.	Correction: Whom did Tom see?
1	The sentence "he had spent five thousand dollars" is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple past perfect tense verb ("had spent") followed by the object ("five thousand dollars"). There are no spelling errors, punctuation errors, or word usage errors. Therefore, it can be understood easily and does not require any corrections.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The subject of the second clause ("her") does not agree with its verb ("to vote"). In addition, there is a missing pronoun before "vote". A possible correction would be: "Fed knows which politician she wants to vote for."	Fed knows which politician she wants to vote for.
0	The sentence contains a minor grammatical error. Instead of "guess," it should be "figure out" because the verb "guess" implies uncertainty, while the context suggests that the speaker has determined the outcome. Additionally, there's no need for a question mark since the statement isn't asking anything.	How did you figure out that he fixed the computer?
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It uses the correct form of the verb "to know" after the subject "the committee," which is a plural noun. Additionally, it employs the possessive pronoun "whose" correctly to refer to the unknown person's efforts to achieve peace. Finally, it ends with a proper punctuation mark, making it a complete sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb in the sentence should agree with its subject in number. In this case, the subject of the sentence is "friend," which is singular. Therefore, the verb should also be singular, but instead we have the plural form "do". A correct version would be "Which house does your friend live in?"	Which house does your friend live in?
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It uses the preposition "from" to indicate where the speaker bought the bagels, followed by a relative clause ("whom I bought these bagels") to provide more information about the identity of the baker. This structure is often used when introducing a new character into a conversation or narrative.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and semantically complete. It has a clear subject ("I"), verb ("found"), and object complement ("the place where we can relax"). Additionally, the possessive pronoun "we" agrees with its plural antecedent "place," and the auxiliary verb "can" indicates possibility, which fits the context well.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The preposition "with" is only needed once in this sentence. It's redundant to include it after "in love". Here's a corrected version of the sentence:	"Jack is the person whom Jenny fell in love with." OR "Jack is the person with whom Jenny fell in love."
1	The sentence "There is a bench to sit on" is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("a bench"), a verb ("is"), and a prepositional phrase ("to sit on") which functions as an adverbial of purpose. This means the sentence expresses the idea that the bench exists for people to use when they want to sit down.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It has a clear subject ("I"), verb ("met"), and object ("the man"). Additionally, it includes a relative clause ("who grows peaches") which modifies the noun before it ("the man"). This structure is grammatically sound and conveys meaning clearly to native speakers of English.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence contains a pronoun error. The singular possessive determiner "his" does not agree in number with the plural noun "approval". It should be changed to the plural form "their" to correctly modify "approval". This would result in the corrected sentence "Which topic did you choose without getting their approval?".	Which topic did you choose without getting their approval?
0	The sentence contains a mistake known as a fragment sentence. A complete sentence requires both a subject ("you") and a predicate ("got bored"). In this case, there is no main verb to form a complete predicate for the subject. Additionally, there is a missing article before "Mary".	The sentence should be revised as follows: "Which topic did you get bored with because Mary talked about it?" Alternatively, if we want to keep the original word order, we could say: "I got bored with the topic that Mary kept talking about."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It has a clear subject ("he"), verb ("resigned") and object ("the reason"). The word "that" is optional here but does not affect grammaticality if omitted.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "It bothers me that John coughs" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "it," which refers to the situation of John's coughing. The verb "bothers" agrees with the singular subject "it." Additionally, the clause "that John coughs" functions as a noun complement, providing more information about what is bothering the speaker. Therefore, no corrections need to be made to this sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb 'to please' should be followed by a subject complement, which describes the subject of the sentence. In this case, the subject is 'John', but there is no subject complement present to complete the predicate. Additionally, the word order suggests that 'John' is the object of the sentence rather than the subject. A more grammatically correct way to express this idea would be "It is easy to please John" or "John is easy to please".	It is easy to please John.
1	The sentence follows all of the necessary grammatical rules for standard English. It has a subject ("Kim"), a verb ("is") and an object ("Tom"). Additionally, it uses proper capitalization and punctuation.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb tense used in this sentence is incorrect for the intended meaning. The past simple tense ("bites") would be appropriate if the speaker were expressing regret about a completed action ("That we invaded Iraq really bited"), but it seems more likely here that they want to say that the invasion of Iraq still has negative consequences in the present. For this meaning, the present perfect tense ("has bitten" or simply "bites" without "really", which is unnecessary emphasis) would be better.	Either "That we invaded Iraq really bites." should be changed to "That we have invaded Iraq really bites.", or "That we invaded Iraq really bites." could be corrected as "That we invaded Iraq bites."
0	The sentence starts with a conjunction 'It', which is incorrect as it does not connect two complete ideas or clauses. Conjunctions such as 'it' should be used to join two independent clauses.	The corrected sentence would be: "Fido's barking annoys me."
0	The sentence contains a common error known as a misplaced modifier. In this case, "who achieved the best result" is acting as a modifying phrase for the subject of the sentence ("was"), but it's intended to modify "Angela". To fix this issue, we need to move the modifying phrase next to the word it's meant to describe.	The sentence should be corrected as follows: "Angela was the one who achieved the best result."
1	The sentence "It was the peasant girl who got it" is grammatically correct. There are no spelling errors, punctuation errors, subject-verb agreement issues, or other common grammatical mistakes.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The error in this sentence lies within the use of the word "anyone". In negative contexts such as this one, we typically use "any" instead of "anyone", which implies a positive statement. Therefore, the corrected form would be "That kind of person is hard to find anyone to look after -> That kind of person is hard to find anyone who can look after."	That kind of person is hard to find anyone who can look after.
0	The verb "doesn't" must agree with its subject in number. In this case, the subject "a sick owl" is singular, so the verb should be "doesn't hunt", but instead it says "doesn't hunts". Therefore, the sentence has a grammatical error.	A sick owl doesn't hunt mice.
0	The subject of the sentence is "each candidate," which is singular. However, the verb "will be admitted" is plural. This inconsistency creates a grammatical error known as subject-verb agreement. In addition, there is no need for a comma after "semanitcs."	Each candidate who has an interest in semantics will be admitted to the department.
0	Following the label, I will provide an explanation detailing why the sentence received its assigned label. This may include specific grammar rules, common errors, and suggestions for improvement. *	In cases where the original sentence is incorrect, the final portion of my response will provide the corrected version of the sentence. For sentences that receive a score of "1," I will simply state "The sentence is already correct." I am ready to begin reviewing the sentences now. Please keep in mind that each sentence must be reviewed separately.
0	The sentence contains a common error of verb tense agreement. The past tense "got" does not agree with its subject "we," which is present tense. A more grammatically correct way to express this idea would be "I'm sure we have even gotten these tickets!" However, it might sound more natural to say "I'm sure we already have these tickets!" instead.	The sentence could be corrected as follows: "I'm sure we already have these tickets!"
0	The sentence contains a spelling mistake. The word "your" is misspelled as "we". It should be "I'm even sure we have these tickets!" instead of "I'm even sure we got these tickets!".	I'm even sure we have these tickets!
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no spelling errors, punctuation mistakes, or grammatical inconsistencies. The subject-verb agreement is also consistent throughout the sentence. Furthermore, the use of conjunctions and prepositions is appropriate. Therefore, there is no need to change anything in the sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There is a clear subject ("I"), verb ("am"), and object ("anything bad about me"). Additionally, there is proper use of punctuation, capitalization, and word order.	The sentence is already correct.
0	This sentence contains a comma splice error. A comma splice occurs when two independent clauses are incorrectly joined by only a comma. Here, "That he was hungry" and "John whined" are both independent clauses and need to be properly connected using a coordinating conjunction ("and," "but," "or," etc.) or a semicolon.	The corrected sentence can either include a coordinating conjunction: "That he was hungry, so John whined"; or use a semicolon: "That he was hungry, John whined."; or rephrase it as one complete thought: "John whined because he was hungry."
0	The sentence contains multiple errors. In English, we typically say "I gave Mary a book after the party" instead of "I gave after the party Mary a book". Additionally, it's more common to use the past simple tense ("gave") rather than present perfect tense ("have given").	I gave Mary a book after the party.
0	The second part of this sentence should use "I" instead of "for". A corrected version would be "as for me, I really like her."	As for me, I really like her. Because she's so pleasant, as for me, I really like her. This revised sentence uses "me" after "as for", which is more grammatically correct than using "for" alone.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It contains a subordinating conjunction ("though") to introduce a dependent clause ("Though he may hate those that criticize Carter"), followed by a main clause ("it doesn't matter"). The subject-verb agreement is also correct in both clauses.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The subject of the sentence is "With no job," which is a prepositional phrase acting as an adverbial modifier, telling us where or when something happens. However, we need a noun or pronoun to serve as the subject of the sentence, followed by a linking verb and predicate nominative or a transitive verb and object. In this case, it seems like the intended meaning is trying to say that John wouldn't be happy without a job. So, let me fix the structure of the sentence while keeping its original idea.	Without a job, John wouldn't be happy.
0	The error in this sentence lies in the use of the determiner 'much' instead of 'many'. 'Much' is used for uncountable nouns while 'many' is used for plural countable nouns. In this case, we are referring to a countable number of pages in the manuscript, so 'many' should be used instead.	I have many of the manuscripts left to type. OR I have much of the manuscript still to type.
1	The sentence "He's a more reliable man" is grammatically correct. Here, "he's" is a contraction of "he is," which functions as a linking verb connecting the subject to its complement "a more reliable man." This complement contains the comparative form "more reliable" modifying the noun "man." Therefore, there are no grammatical errors in this sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The word "any" should be used with a negative statement or question, but here it is used with a positive statement which makes the sentence incorrect. A correct version of this sentence would be "I don't want any trouble."	The sentence should be "Trouble is what I don't want."
1	The sentence "They may grow as high as bamboo" is grammatically correct. It uses the modal verb "may" to indicate possibility, followed by a subject ("they"), and a comparison using "as...as". Bamboo can refer both to the plant itself or its height. Therefore, it's clear from context what is meant here - that the thing being discussed has the potential to reach similar heights as bamboo plants do. No grammatical errors were found in this sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The subject of the sentence does not agree with the verb. The plural subject "some" requires a plural verb, but instead we have the singular verb "made".	Some of them made as many errors as twenty. OR The sentence could also be written as "They made as many as twenty errors each," which would avoid the issue altogether by using a plural subject ("they") with a plural verb ("made").
0	The reflexive pronoun used here should be "himself," but since "he" is a third-person singular pronoun, it should actually be "kissed him." In this case, there's no need for a reflexive pronoun because the subject of the verb isn't performing the action on itself.	The sentence should read as follows: "Sally kissed him."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no obvious spelling errors, punctuation marks are used correctly, and the word order follows standard English rules. Furthermore, the verb tenses agree, making the overall structure of the sentence clear to the reader.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence follows all of the rules of standard written English and does not contain any grammatical errors.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and uses appropriate word choice. The subject ("we") and verb ("will make") agree in number, and the subordinating conjunction "without" introduces a dependent clause effectively. Additionally, the modal verb "will" indicates future tense appropriately.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The subject of the second clause ("Betsy is pretty") is "Betsy," which is a third-person singular noun. Therefore, the verb must agree with it and be conjugated as "is" rather than "shows." Additionally, the gender pronoun "herself" does not fit here since there's no reflexive action described for Betsy. It seems to me that the intended meaning might have been expressed using something similar to: "Blue leather reveals how pretty Betsy is." However, I would need more context to ensure my correction matches the original intent.	Blue leather reveals that Betsy is pretty.
1	The sentence "Gwen hit the baseball" is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("Gwen"), a verb ("hit") in the past tense, and an object ("the baseball"). All of these elements combine to form a simple sentence with proper syntax and usage.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "hit" does not agree with its subject "I". A correct form of the verb must be used for the first-person singular pronoun "I", which would be "have hit" or simply "hit" if referring to a past action performed by the speaker. Additionally, there seems to be some confusion between the informal contraction "you're" (meaning "you are") and the possessive form "your," resulting in unclear meaning.	I think you know the answer. Or, if it refers to a past action done by the speaker: I hit the ball; didn't you see?
1	The sentence is a grammatically correct example of a correlative conjunction, which uses the words "either" and "or" to connect two ideas. In this case, the speaker is suggesting they have either lost their wallet or lost their mind. Both options are parallel grammatical structures ("my wallet" and "my mind"), making the construction clear and easy to understand.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There is a noun ("car") that serves as the direct object of the verb ("bought"). The adjective phrase "brand new" modifies the noun "car," providing more information about it. Additionally, the subject-verb agreement is correct; the singular third person present tense form of the verb "to buy" agrees with its singular third person subject "he."	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and conveys a clear meaning. There are no errors in subject-verb agreement, word choice, tense usage, or punctuation.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "They chased the man with the car" is grammatically correct. Here, "with the car" functions as an adverbial of means, indicating how they chased the man. It's a common structure in English to use "with + noun" to describe the tool or method used for performing an action. In this case, it tells us that "they" used a car to chase the man. Therefore, there are no grammatical errors in this sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "I didn't have a red cent" is grammatically correct. It is a colloquial expression in American English meaning that the speaker did not have any money.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect because there are two different objects of the verb "takes" - "the book of poems" and "from Blackwell". It's unclear what "from Blackwell" refers to. Additionally, we need an article before "Blackwell", as it seems to be referring to a specific place ("a Blackwell").	The sentence could be corrected as follows: "Reading the book of poems from Blackwell takes a very long time." However, if "Blackwell" refers to a publisher rather than a location, the corrected sentence would be: "The book of poems published by Blackwell takes a very long time to read."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There is a noun ("the one"), which is modified by a prepositional phrase ("with a red cover") acting as an adjective phrase. Following this is a verb phrase ("takes a very long time") followed by its direct object ("to read"). All of these components make sense together and follow standard English syntax rules.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and makes sense semantically. There is a subject ("John"), a helping verb ("has"), a noun ("fear") functioning as a verb followed by its complement ("of dogs").	The sentence is already correct.
0	In this sentence, we have a subject-verb agreement error. The subject of the sentence is "the building," which is singular. However, the verb "is" does not agree with the plural noun "roof." Therefore, the correct form of the verb should be "has," as in "The building's roof has been leaking."	The building's roof has been leaking.
0	The noun "coat" is countable, so it requires a determiner before it. In this case, there is no need to repeat the article "the," as it would be redundant. Therefore, the correct form of the sentence should be "the panther's coat is dark black" without the repeated definite article.	The panther's coat is dark black.
1	The sentence "Colin asked if they could get a mortgage" is grammatically correct. It contains a main clause ("Colin asked") and a subordinate clause ("if they could get a mortgage"). Both clauses contain proper subject-verb agreement and use appropriate verb tenses. Additionally, the pronouns used are clear and consistent throughout the sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
0	This sentence is grammatically incorrect because it implies that two actions were performed by the same person ("the man") without explicitly stating this connection. A relative clause would be needed to clarify that the man who got into the cab also committed the robbery.	The man who got into the cab robbed the bank.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It has a subject ("I"), an auxiliary verb ("do"), a main verb ("know"), and an object ("you"). The word order follows standard English rules. There are no spelling errors or punctuation issues.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "John's drum," which is a possessive noun indicating ownership. The verb is "will bother," which indicates future tense and shows that the action of being bothered by the drum will continue to happen. The object of the sentence is "me." Overall, the structure of the sentence is clear and easy to understand.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no spelling errors, punctuation errors, or word usage issues. The subject ("an evil thought") and verb ("struck") agree in number, and the sentence has a clear structure.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "In the classroom John put the book on the table" is grammatically correct. It has a clear subject ("John"), verb ("put"), and object ("the book"). Additionally, it uses proper prepositions to indicate location ("in the classroom," "on the table"). There are no spelling errors or awkward phrasings.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Phillip gave the medal to the soldier" is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("Phillip"), a verb ("gave") and an object ("the medal"). Additionally, it uses proper preposition usage with "to".	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "thinks" requires a subject complement to follow it, which should either be a noun or a pronoun. In this case, the subject complement is "Andy to eat salmon flavored candy bars," but this is incorrect because it does not include a proper form of the verb "to eat." Instead, it includes an infinitive phrase, which cannot function as a subject complement. Additionally, there should be a conjunction between "Andy" and "to eat salmon flavored candy bars" to show that these two phrases are related.	Heidi thinks that Andy is going to eat salmon flavored candy bars.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and makes sense semantically. There is a subject ("Heidi") who is expressing her opinion about something ("Andy should eat salmon flavored candy bars"). This forms a complete thought, making it a complete sentence. Additionally, all of the words are spelled correctly, and there are no punctuation errors.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "He danced" is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple sentence with a subject ("he") and a verb ("danced"). Both subject and verb agree in number, making the sentence grammatically sound.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb 'did' requires a base form of the verb after it, so the correct question would be "Did Calvin do his homework?" instead of "Did Calvin his homework?"	Did Calvin do his homework?
1	The sentence "Sylvia was slapping Jeff upside the head in martial arts class" is grammatically correct. It contains a complete thought and all of its elements are arranged properly to convey meaning. Additionally, there are no spelling errors or incorrect word choices.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It has a conditional structure ("If I am a rich man") followed by what would happen as a result of meeting that condition ("I'd buy a diamond ring"). Both clauses have a clear subject-verb agreement, making it a well-constructed sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The verb form "he'd" is a contraction of "he would," which is used correctly here to express irrealis mood for hypothetical situations. The past tense "were" instead of "was" before "a rich man" also follows standard usage rules for formal English when referring to singular nouns ("man").	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "John is likely to leave" is grammatically correct. The word "likely" functions as a modal verb helping to express the degree of possibility about the future action of leaving performed by John. Therefore, there is no need for any correction.	The sentence is already correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct as it follows standard English syntax rules for a simple sentence. It contains a subject ("the manager") and a verb ("laughed"), which expresses completed action in the past tense.	The sentence is already correct.
0	This sentence is missing a subject and context to be grammatically complete. The word 'sunk' can function as either the past tense of the verb 'to sink' or as the past participle form used after helping verbs such as 'has,' 'have,' and 'had.' However, without additional information it cannot be determined how 'sunk' should properly fit into a sentence.	The sentence is not correct; a possible correction could be: "They had sunk the ship."
0	The verb tense used in the sentence is incorrect. Instead of using "did" before "you," it would be grammatically correct to say "Who do you think kissed the gorilla?" This is because the action of kissing the gorilla has not yet been completed, so we use the present tense ("do") instead of the past tense ("did").	Who do you think kisses the gorilla?
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and uses appropriate punctuation. All words are spelled correctly, and there are no awkward phrasings or misplaced modifiers.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "It seems that Lucy was mugged" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "it," which is used as a dummy pronoun to indicate that the statement is based on assumption or probability rather than certainty. The verb "seems" is followed by the subordinating conjunction "that," introducing the clause "Lucy was mugged." This clause contains the simple past tense of the verb "to be" (was), which agrees with the singular noun "Lucy." Therefore, there are no grammatical errors in this sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and makes sense in context. The past tense verb "ate" agrees with the subject "I," and the relative clause "that was filled with lima beans" modifies the noun "salad" appropriately.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The past tense verb "arriving" agrees with its subject "four men," and the time expression "when I pulled up" correctly sets the scene for a past event.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Jean is reluctant to dance" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence, "Jean," is a proper noun and is correctly identified by the pronoun "is". Additionally, the infinitive verb "to dance" accurately describes what Jean is reluctant to do.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "I want her to dance" is grammatically correct. It consists of a subject ("I"), a verb ("want") in the present tense first person singular form, and an infinitive clause ("her to dance"). There are no spelling, punctuation, or grammatical errors.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Jean persuaded Robert" is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple sentence with a subject ("Jean") and a verb ("persuaded"). There are no spelling errors, punctuation errors, or grammatical errors in the sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Jean wants Bill to do the Macarena" is grammatically correct. It consists of a main clause ("Jean wants") and an infinitive phrase ("to do the Macarena"), which functions as the direct object of the verb "wants". There are no grammatical errors or awkward constructions in this sentence, so it receives a score of 1 for being grammatically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a simple sentence with a subject ("the children") and a verb ("admire"). Additionally, the possessive form "their" correctly indicates ownership by multiple people.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It is a question formed using the auxiliary verb "has" followed by the subject "Peter" and the past participle of the verb "talk," which is "talked." The preposition "with" is correctly used after the verb to indicate who Peter communicated with.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence follows all of the rules of standard written English and does not contain any errors.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The reflexive pronoun used here should be "himself" if the subject of the inner clause ("he") refers to "John". However, the sentence uses "selves", which is plural and incorrect for a singular subject.	John thinks that Mary loves him.
0	The sentence contains a small error known as a pronoun ambiguity. It's unclear whether 'himself' refers to John or someone else. A clearer way to ask the question would be: "Which pictures of him does John like?" This makes it clear that we're talking about someone other than John.	Which pictures of him does John like?
0	The subject of the sentence, "any owl," is a singular noun, so it requires a singular verb to agree with it. In the present tense, singular third-person subjects require the addition of an 's' to the base form of the verb. Therefore, the verb "hunt" must be changed to "hunts" for grammatical agreement between the subject and the verb.	Any owl hunts mouse**s**. Note: I also corrected "mice" to "mouse(s)" because "any owl" refers to one individual owl at a time, which would typically hunt only one mouse during each hunting event. However, if we wanted to indicate that any owl eats multiple mice over a period of time, we could keep "mice".
0	This sentence contains a double negative ("any" + "didn't"), which results in a positive statement rather than a negative one. In other words, the sentence says that there is some man who did eat dinner, but it should say that no man ate dinner. Double negatives can create confusion and make statements unclear.	No man ate dinner.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The modal verb "could" indicates possibility in the present tense, which is appropriate for the context of a hypothetical situation involving a pilot flying the plane.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It uses a relative clause ("whoever they were") to modify the subject of the main clause ("Everybody"). This construction is used to emphasize the identity of the people referred to in the first part of the sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and understandable. There are no spelling errors, punctuation errors, subject-verb agreement issues, or other common grammatical errors.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in this sentence. The plural noun "tigers" requires a plural verb, so it should be "have" instead of "has". Additionally, the article "a" before "black stripes" is unnecessary because all tigers have black stripes as part of their fur pattern.	Any tiger has orange fur, marked with black stripes. (incorrect) The sentence should read: "Any tiger has orange fur with black stripes."
0	Albinism in animals, including tigers, results in a lack of pigmentation, causing white fur and skin, as well as red or pink eyes due to the absence of melanin. Therefore, it is biologically impossible for any albino tiger to have orange fur.	An orange tiger has fur marked with black stripes; however, an albino tiger would have white fur and skin, along with blue or pink eyes.
0	The sentence contains a common grammatical error known as a missing definite article. In this case, "a" should be placed before "flower".	You must pick a flower you see.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows a subject-verb-object structure ("Any pilot" as the subject, "could be flying" as the verb, and "this plane" as the object), and all words are used appropriately within their contexts. There is no need for any correction.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence follows all of the necessary grammar rules and has proper punctuation. All words used in the sentence are spelled correctly as well. There are no awkward phrasings or unclear meanings present within the sentence. Therefore, it can be concluded that the sentence is grammatically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It contains two independent clauses ("The Dodgers beat the Red Sox" and "were beaten by the Giants") that are connected by a coordinating conjunction ("and"). Each clause has a subject and verb, which is necessary for grammatical completeness.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It has a question form with the subject-auxiliary inversion ("was" comes before "the man"), and it contains all necessary elements to make sense.	The sentence is already correct.
0	This sentence contains a common grammatical error known as a misplaced modifier. In this case, "who Mary loves and Sally hates" is a restrictive relative clause that should be immediately adjacent to the noun it modifies. However, in this sentence, it is separated from its intended antecedent ("the man") by the intervening word "computed". To fix this error, we can rephrase the sentence so that the relative clause comes directly after "the man", as follows:	The man who Mary loves and Sally hates is the one who computed my tax.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It uses a relative clause ("which Mary made") to modify the noun "kennel," indicating possession. Additionally, it correctly employs the past perfect tense ("has been stolen") to indicate that the theft occurred before another past action or time.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no spelling errors, punctuation marks are used correctly, and there are no awkward phrasings or unclear meanations. Additionally, the subject-verb agreement is consistent throughout the sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It has a clear subject ("the wealthy young man"), verb ("bought"), and object ("that piano"). Additionally, it includes appropriate modifiers to provide additional information about both the subject and the object of the sentence. Finally, the word "fiancée" is appropriately used here to refer to a woman who is engaged to be married but has not yet had her wedding ceremony.	The sentence is already correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure of a simple sentence in English. Additionally, each word is spelled correctly and all necessary punctuation marks have been used appropriately.	The sentence is already correct. Note: I'm glad to provide further explanation if needed! Just let me know if there's anything unclear about my response.
1	The sentence "a tall building" is grammatically correct. It consists of an article ("a") followed by a singular noun ("building"). Since there is no verb present, it functions as a noun phrase rather than a full sentence. However, since only complete sentences were requested for evaluation, I will treat this as if it had been presented within a larger context where its grammaticality could be determined more fully. In isolation, however, one cannot definitively say whether the sentence is grammatically correct because we do not know what action or state of being might follow from or apply to the subject "tall building". But without additional information about how this fragment fits into a broader discourse, I must assume it is functioning properly.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "This building is tall" is grammatically correct. It consists of a subject ("this building"), a linking verb ("is"), and a complement ("tall") which describes the subject. There are no spelling errors, punctuation errors, or grammatical errors in this sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "I like the book which you gave me" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * The subject of the sentence is "I," a pronoun that refers to the speaker. * The verb is "like," which indicates a positive emotion towards something. * The direct object of the sentence is "the book," which receives the action of the verb. * The relative clause "which you gave me" provides additional information about the noun it modifies ("book"). It contains another subject ("you"), verb ("gave"), and indirect object ("me"). All these elements agree in number and person, making the sentence clear and concise.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("Captain Wentworth"), a verb ("wrote"), and an object ("a letter"). Additionally, it includes a prepositional phrase ("to Anne Elliot") which modifies the verb. All of these elements form a complete thought, making the sentence grammatically sound.	The sentence is already correct.
0	In this sentence, there is a subject-auxiliary inversion error. The correct form of the question would be "She asked **is** Alison coming to the party?" because when we have auxiliary verbs such as 'do', 'does', 'did', 'have', 'has' etc., they come before the subject in questions. Therefore, it must be "is" instead of "was".	She asked is Alison coming to the party.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It uses the past perfect tense ("had been") to indicate that the action of Sir Thomas being offended happened before another past event (the moment when people realized his state), which is appropriate in context.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("Fanny"), a verb tense expressing regret in the past ("regretted") and an infinitive clause ("having to talk") which functions as direct object of the main verb. This structure is used when we want to indicate that something happened before another action took place in the past. In this case, it suggests that Fanny's conversation with Aunt Norris occurred after she started feeling regretful about it.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Knowing the country well, he took a short cut" is grammatically correct. It has a subject ("he") and a verb ("took"), and it uses the present participle phrase "Knowing the country well," correctly to modify the subject of the sentence. This type of construction is often used to provide additional information about the subject without interrupting the flow of the main clause.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and the use of verb tenses, prepositions, articles, and punctuation are all appropriate. There does not appear to be any spelling errors as well.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence follows all of the rules of standard written English and does not contain any grammatical errors or typos. It is a simple declarative sentence with a subject ("Magnus"), verb ("went"), and object ("Ireland"). There are no punctuation or capitalization errors.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence is missing a question mark at the end to indicate it as a question. Also, there should be a comma after "John" for clarity and proper grammar.	Who did John send the book? - Adding a question mark at the end makes it grammatically correct. Who, did John send the book? - Including a comma after 'Who' also fixes the issue.
0	In this sentence, there is a mismatch between the subject ("the idea") and the verb ("dismayed"). Since "idea" is singular, it requires a singular verb form. However, "dismayed" is the past tense of the verb "to dismay," which typically takes the form "disappoints" when used as a linking verb for a singular noun such as "idea." Therefore, the corrected sentence would read:	The idea disappointed the Prime Minister that the Dome was dull.
0	The sentence contains two errors related to subject-verb agreement and word order. In the first part of the sentence, 'he' is singular but it is followed by the plural verb 'did'. Also, there is no need for the word 'in' after 'came', and 'without so much as a knock' would be better placed at the end of the sentence.	He came right up without so much as a knock.
1	The sentence "Harriet admired Mr Knightley" is grammatically correct. There are no spelling errors, punctuation errors, or grammatical errors in the sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "The book is boring" is grammatically correct. It consists of a noun ("book") and a linking verb ("is"), followed by an adjective ("boring"). This structure is commonly used to describe the subject of a sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It has a subject ("Ethel"), a verb ("wishes") and an object clause ("to ask you some awkward questions"). There are no spelling errors and the word order is correct. Therefore, there's nothing to correct.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence follows all of the necessary grammatical rules for standard English. It has a subject ("Emma"), a verb ("made"), and an object ("Harriet"). Additionally, it includes a possessive modifier ("some food") to clarify what kind of food Emma made for Harriet.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "The window was broken with a hammer" is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple sentence structure with a subject ("the window"), verb ("was broken") and object complement ("with a hammer"). There are no grammatical errors such as incorrect word order, missing punctuation marks, misspelled words, or unclear antecedents. Therefore, it can be concluded that the sentence is correctly written.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The verb tense ("lay") is appropriate for a present continuous action being performed by the subject of the sentence ("the fugitive"). Additionally, the purpose clause "in order to avoid discovery" correctly modifies the main clause, explaining why the fugitive is lying motionless.	The sentence is already correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. There are no spelling errors, punctuation errors, or grammatical errors. Additionally, the word order follows standard English syntax rules.	The guard marched the prisoners round the yard. The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Frank Churchill crossed the street" is grammatically correct. It contains a proper noun ("Frank Churchill") as the subject, a verb ("crossed"), and an object of the preposition ("the street"). There are no spelling errors, punctuation errors, or misused words.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and semantically complete. It follows the standard subject-verb-object structure, and there are no apparent spelling errors or incorrect word usage.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The auxiliary verb "might" is used correctly to express possibility, and it agrees with the subject "Fiona". The time expression "by 5 o'clock" indicates when Fiona may arrive, which is also grammatically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The conjunction "and" connects two independent clauses, so they need to have parallel structures. In this case, the first clause "I am both expecting to get the job" has a verb ("am expecting") followed by its object ("the job"). However, the second clause starts with "of the opinion," which does not follow the same structure as the first clause. It would be better written as follows:	"I both expect to get the job and consider it desirable." OR "I am both expecting to get the job and think it's desirable."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and makes sense in context. There is a clear subject ("Pat"), verb ("was awarded"), and two independent clauses connected by the conjunction "and". Both clauses contain complete thoughts and express a single idea.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence contains two grammatical errors. Firstly, "alienating" should be used instead of "alienated" as it requires a present tense verb to match the second clause ("beating"). Secondly, there is no article before "dog," which makes the sentence incomplete.	Kim alienates cats and beats his dog.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and conveys a clear meaning. It follows standard subject-verb agreement rules and uses proper punctuation marks.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence contains a noun phrase "papers without reading" which requires an article before it. Therefore, the sentence is grammatically incorrect as it stands.	Which paper did Terry file without reading? Or, alternatively, Which articles did Terry file without reading?
1	The sentence is correctly written according to standard English rules. There are no grammatical errors or misspellings in the sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The present continuous tense requires a verb+ing form after "goes", but here we have the infinitive form of the verb "buy". Also, there's no need for an article before "whiskey" when referring to alcoholic beverages in general.	The sentence should read as follows: "She goes to buy some whiskey."
0	The subject of the sentence "Kim and Terry" is plural, so the verb must also be plural. Therefore, "is" should be changed to "are".	Kim and Terry are happy.
1	The sentence follows all of the standard rules for English grammar and punctuation, so it does not require any corrections.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence contains no grammatical errors and follows proper sentence structure. It clearly expresses one action (putting a picture of Bill in the mailbox) that will be completed before another action (tomorrow), and it specifies where the second instance of putting the picture will occur (on your desk).	The sentence is already correct.
0	The first part of the sentence, "Put a picture of Bill on your desk before tomorrow," seems to be missing a subject, making it a fragment instead of a complete sentence. Additionally, there's no punctuation between the two sentences, which can make it difficult for the reader to distinguish them as separate thoughts.	"You should put a picture of Bill on your desk before tomorrow. This girl in the red coat will do the same."
0	The sentence contains a misplaced modifier. The phrase "this girl in the red coat" incorrectly modifies "Picture of Bill," leading to confusion about who is wearing the red coat. It should modify "will put," indicating which person is wearing the red coat.	This girl in the red coat will put a picture of Bill on your desk before tomorrow.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and there are no spelling errors. The use of articles ("a"), prepositions ("of"), and verb tense agree with the subject-verb agreement rule. In addition, the punctuation mark used is appropriate.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "John became deadly afraid of flying" is grammatically correct. Here, "deadly" is used as an adverb to modify the verb "afraid". It means extremely or very. Therefore, there's no mistake in using "deadly" before "afraid".	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "What John promised is to be gentle" is grammatically correct, but it might be clearer if rephrased slightly. Here, "to be gentle" is a noun clause acting as the direct object of the verb "promised," which means that what John actually promised was some action or behavior described by "to be gentle." However, without additional context, it's unclear exactly what John committed to doing gently. A more specific subject for the infinitive would help clarify the meaning. For example: "What John promised is to be gentle when he petals the dog."	The original sentence is already correct, although here are two possible rephrasings that could make its meaning clearer: * What John promised is gentleness. * John promised to act gently.
0	The sentence contains a minor error known as a question pronoun gap. In order for the question to be grammatically complete, it requires the inclusion of a specific question word such as 'what' before the noun 'books'. This will help clarify what exactly is being asked about.	Henri wants to buy what books about cooking?
0	The sentence contains a common grammatical error known as a pronoun agreement error. In this case, "it" should be used instead of "I" to agree with the plural subject "computer(s)".	The sentence should read: "I will fix the computers for Carol." Alternatively, if only one computer needs fixing, it could be rephrased as follows: "I will fix Carol's computer."
1	The sentence "Smith loaned a valuable collection of manuscripts to the library" is grammatically correct. The subject "Smith" is singular and the verb "loaned" agrees with it in number. Additionally, the article "a" correctly precedes the noun "valuable collection," which functions as an adjective modifying the following noun "manuscripts." Finally, the preposition "to" introduces the indirect object "the library."	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "The paper is cut by Mary" is grammatically correct. Here's a breakdown of why: * "The paper" is a noun phrase serving as the subject of the sentence. It consists of the definite article "the" and the singular countable noun "paper". * "is cut" is the verb phrase, consisting of the auxiliary verb "is" and the past participle form of the verb "cut". This construction indicates passive voice, meaning that the action ("cutting") is being done to the subject ("paper"). * "by Mary" is a prepositional phrase acting as an adverbial modifier within the larger verb phrase. It specifies who performs the cutting action. Overall, the syntax is clear and unambiguous, making for a well-formed English sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. Both "it was from six to nine" and "it took place from six to nine" are valid ways of expressing that something happened between six o'clock and nine o'clock.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is correctly written in terms of grammar, punctuation, and spelling. It also conveys a complete thought, making it a proper sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
0	This sentence is a sentence fragment because it lacks a main verb to form a complete thought. Also, there is no punctuation between the two clauses, which makes it unclear if they are meant to be separate thoughts or one compound thought.	Either of the following would work as a corrected version of the original sentence: * The soup cooks and thickens. * The soup cooks; it thickens.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and easy to understand. The subject of the sentence ("I") is the person performing the action ("gave"), which is indicated by the past tense verb. The indirect object ("money") receives the direct object ("charity"). There are no misspellings, incorrect word usage, or awkward phrasing.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "John asked." is grammatically correct. It consists of a proper noun ("John") followed by a verb in past tense ("asked"). No additional components such as objects or complements are required to complete the meaning of the sentence. Therefore, it meets all necessary grammatical rules for a simple sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The subject of the sentence requires a determiner before it, so the sentence should be either "I saw the students" (if multiple students were seen), or "I saw the student" (if only one student was seen). Without context specifying otherwise, we will assume that more than one student could have been seen, making the plural form appropriate here.	I saw the students.
0	The sentence "John whispered Mary left" is grammatically incorrect because it lacks a main verb for the subject "Mary". It seems as though two separate actions ("whispered" and "left") have been jammed together without proper syntax. A possible correction could be "John whispered 'Mary has left.'" or "John whispered as Mary left.", depending on context and intended meaning.	John whispered as Mary left.
0	In English, we typically use if-clauses to express uncertainty about future events rather than wondering clauses. A more appropriate way to convey the intended meaning would be “Mary wonders if Bill will come.” This structure implies a question without using an actual question mark. The original sentence could potentially work as direct speech (“Mary wonders, ‘Will Bill come?’”), but it's unclear from context whether that's the case here. I assume it isn't since no quotation marks were provided.	Mary wonders if Bill will come.
0	The verb "will" indicates future tense, but there is no appropriate main verb following it. In this case, "theater" seems to be intended as a verb ("Sophie will go to the theater"), but it's written as if it were a noun.	Sophie will **go** to the theater.
1	The sentence "John finished the cake and drank the lemonade" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure for both clauses ("John finished the cake" and "he drank the lemonade"). Both verbs agree with their subjects, and there are no obvious spelling errors or misplaced words.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The subject of the sentence "Herself" is a reflexive pronoun which refers back to the subject of the previous clause or sentence. However, there is no preceding clause or sentence here. Moreover, using reflexive pronoun as the subject can make the sentence sounds awkward and unnatural. A personal pronoun such as 'she' would be more appropriate.	She likes Mary's mother.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject ("each of the boys") is plural, so the verb must also be plural ("fought"). Additionally, the prepositional phrase "with some of the other boys" correctly shows the relationship between the boys who were fighting.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The reflexive pronoun used here should refer back to the subject of the sentence. In this case, the subject is "John's mother," but the reflexive pronoun "himself" refers to a male person. Instead, we should use "herself" as the reflexive pronoun to correctly match the gender of the subject.	John's mother likes herself.
0	The subject of the sentence "Mary" is a female name, so it should be followed by a reflexive pronoun in the third person singular feminine form ("herself"), rather than the masculine form ("himself"). This error violates grammatical agreement rules between subjects and reflexive pronouns.	Mary revealed herself to John.
1	The sentence "Mary believes that Bill saw himself" is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("Mary"), a verb ("believes"), and a clause ("that Bill saw himself") that functions as the direct object of the main verb. The reflexive pronoun "himself" correctly refers back to the antecedent "Bill".	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "John heard that they criticized themselves" is grammatically correct. The subject of the main clause is "John," which is a singular noun. The verb "heard" agrees with the subject in number, as it is also a singular verb. The subordinate clause "they criticized themselves" has a plural subject ("they") and a plural verb ("criticized"). Therefore, both clauses have subjects and verbs that agree in number, making the sentence grammatically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence follows all of the rules of standard English grammar and usage, so it is correct as written.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Henry found that Bill is sad" is grammatically correct. In this sentence, the subject ("Henry") is the one who performs the action of discovering something, while the clause "that Bill is sad" gives additional information about what Henry discovered. This type of sentence structure is called a complex sentence, where there is an independent clause followed by a dependent clause introduced by the word "that".	The sentence is already correct.
0	The adjective "proud" should be used after a verb of thinking or feeling, such as "considers," to describe how someone feels about themselves. However, when describing feelings about another person, we use the past participle form "proud of" instead. Therefore, the correct usage would be "John considers himself to be proud of Mary" or simply "John is proud of Mary".	John considers himself to be proud of Mary.
0	The correct form of the verb to be for singular third person should be used, so instead of "you should sit before there," it should be "he/she/it should sit before there" or "you should sit before him/her/it." Additionally, a preposition such as "in front of" could also be added after "before" to clarify the relationship between the subject and "there."	He should sit before it.
1	The sentence "There is a nurse available" is grammatically correct. The verb "is" agrees with its subject "nurse," which is singular. Moreover, the word order follows standard English syntax rules. Also, there are no spelling errors, punctuation marks are used correctly, and the meaning of the sentence can be easily understood. Therefore, it does not require any corrections.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "hopes" does not agree with its subject "everyone". In order for the verb to agree with its subject, it must be in plural form when referring to multiple people. Additionally, there needs to be a separate pronoun after "to", since we hope something for ourselves but hope something *that* others do.	Everyone hopes that everyone sleeps well.
1	The sentence "Everyone hopes that he will sleep" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "Everyone" is a singular, gender-neutral pronoun used to refer to all people as a group. It requires a singular verb form such as "hopes". In this case, "everyone" serves as the subject of the sentence. * "hopes" is the third person present tense conjugate of the verb "to hope", which agrees with the subject "everyone". * "that" introduces a subordinate clause indicating the content of the hope. * "he" refers to a male individual who is being hoped to do something specific - namely, sleep. Although some might argue for using "they" instead of "he" here, "he" is still considered acceptable by many style guides when referring to individuals whose genders are unknown or irrelevant to the context. * "will sleep" is the first person singular future tense indicative mood of the verb "to sleep", expressing a prediction about what "he" will do later on. This matches the time frame implied by "everyone hoping".	The sentence is already correct.
0	The repetition of the name "Churchill" at the beginning of each clause is redundant and incorrect. It would be better to rephrase it as follows: "Only Winston Churchill remembered his own Blood, Sweat and Tears speech."	Only Winston Churchill remembered his own Blood, Sweat and Tears speech.
0	The verb 'promise' requires a base form of the verb after it, so 'to shave' should be changed to just 'shave'. Additionally, we need to add a comma after 'Mary' for clarity.	John promised Mary, to shave himself. Or even better: John promised Mary he would shave himself.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and has a clear subject ("John"), verb ("convinced"), and object ("Bill"). It also contains a dependent clause ("that Mary should sleep") which provides additional information about the action of convincing.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence contains a coordinate structure ("I saw Bill" and "you did so Mary") where "so" does not have an appropriate antecedent. Therefore, it is unclear what action the speaker wants the listener to repeat. Additionally, there seems to be missing punctuation between the two clauses. A coordinating conjunction such as 'and' would make the meaning clearer.	The corrected sentence could be: "I saw Bill while you did that, Mary."
0	The subject of the second clause ("Bill") needs to be connected to the verb using a helping verb such as "was" or "did". A corrected version could be "What Mary did was **give** Bill a book," or "What Mary saw was Bill **giving** her a book."	What Mary did was give Bill a book.
0	The sentence is missing a verb in the past tense to indicate what action the bears took after sniffing.	The bears sniffed around for food.
1	The sentence is already correct. There are no grammatical errors or awkward phrasings. The subject ("to steal talismans") and predicate ("is dangerous") are clear and concise. Additionally, the object of the preposition "from" ("witches") is also appropriate for the context.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "demonize" needs to have a direct object following it because it is a transitive verb. In other words, there must be someone or something being transformed into a devil or evil spirit. Therefore, the sentence "Anson demonized" is grammatically incorrect since there's no direct object indicating who or what was demonized by Anson.	The sentence should be corrected as follows: "Anson demonized someone/something." For example, "Anson demonized the opposition party," or "Anson demonized the new technology."
0	The verb "kick" requires a singular object when used reflexively ("to kick oneself"), so it's incorrect to use the plural form of the pronoun "yourself." Additionally, it's uncommon for someone to say they "kicked themselves," as it usually implies self-reproach rather than physical action. A more natural way to express the intended meaning might be "you guys kicked each other" if referring to multiple people kicking one another, or simply "you kicked something" if referring to a group of individuals collectively kicking an object.	The sentence is not correct. A possible correction would be: "You kicked something" or "You guys kicked each other."
0	This sentence contains a redundant relative pronoun "that". It can be omitted without changing the meaning of the sentence. Also, there is no verb in the second clause to indicate what the speaker will do with the book.	The book I said I'd never read. OR The book that I said I would never read.
0	The verb "demonize" should be followed by the preposition "as" instead of "up". Additionally, there is a missing article before "Khyber".	Anson demonized the Khyber as evil.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The phrase "it is not true that" negates the possibility of the speaker attending the party, which is expressed using the modal verb "might" along with the future infinitive "be going to". Therefore, no corrections need to be made.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "kick" needs to agree with its subject in number. In this case, the subject is "you," which is singular. Therefore, the correct form of the verb should be "kicks" instead of "kick." Additionally, there should be a space before the exclamation mark for proper punctuation.	"Kick you!" should be "Kicks you!"
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and makes sense in context. There is a subject ("Jason"), a verb ("persuaded") and an object ("the doctor"). Additionally, there is an infinitive phrase ("to treat Medea") which functions as the direct object of the verb "persuaded".	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence contains a common grammatical error known as a pronoun reference issue. The word "you" does not have a clear antecedent, making it unclear who received an accurate description. A better way to construct the sentence would be to specify the person being referred to. For example: "Did John give you an accurate description of...?" or "Did you receive an accurate description of... from John?"	Did you get an accurate description of the project's goals?
1	In this case, the sentence "The Peter we all like was at the party" is grammatically correct. There is a noun ("Peter") which has a determiner ("the"), followed by an adjective phrase ("we all like") attributing some additional information about him, and finally there's a verb ("was") conjugated correctly for past tense referring to his presence at the party. Hence, no corrections needed here!	The sentence is already correct.
0	This sentence is missing a noun or pronoun to complete its meaning. It seems as though it is the beginning of a sentence, but without additional context or information, it is unclear what exactly the government is imposing a fine on. A complete sentence requires both a subject and a predicate; here, there is only a verb ("is imposing") but no clear subject or object.	The government's imposition of a fine on polluting companies will help reduce carbon emissions.
1	The sentence "Did Athena help us?" is grammatically correct. It consists of a question tag ("did") followed by the subject ("Athena") and the auxiliary verb ("help"). There are no spelling, punctuation, or grammar errors.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "You wanted to meet the man I saw" is grammatically correct. There are no spelling errors, punctuation errors, subject-verb agreement issues, tense inconsistencies, or other common grammatical errors in this sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "demonize" should be followed by a gerund (-ing form of the verb), so it should be "demonizing," not "demonized." Additionally, there is no punctuation between "Anson" and "demonized," which makes the sentence hard to read. It would be better if there were a comma after "Anson."	Corrected sentence: Anson, demonizing David, did so every day.
0	The word "programme" should be spelled as "program" in American English. In British English, both spellings are acceptable but it's more common to say "there is a program on Radio 4 tonight".	The sentence would be "There is a program about Euripides on Radio 4 tonight," if using American English spelling, or "There is a programme about Euripides on Radio 4 tonight," if using British English spelling where the word "programme" is preferred over "program".
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and makes sense contextually. The subject of the sentence ("Medea") is clearly identified, the verb tense is consistent, and there are no obvious spelling or punctuation errors. Additionally, the statement contains a clear negation that conveys accurate information about the character's actions.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and understandable. There are no spelling errors, punctuation errors, or word usage issues. The subject ("the elixir") and verb ("was hidden") agree in number. The prepositional phrases "in a hole" and "in the ground" provide clear spatial information about the location of the elixir.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence is missing a definite or indefinite article before the word "Trade". It should be either "at the trade" or "at a trade", depending on the intended meaning.	Either "Extremely frantically, Anson danced at the trade" or "Extremely frantantly, Anson danced at a trade," depending on the context.
0	The sentence contains a grammatical error known as a pronoun reference issue. It's unclear what the subject of the second verb ("who") refers to because there are two possible antecedents - "you" and "Medea". To clarify the meaning, we need to rephrase it by specifying which one is being asked about.	What did you ask about the thing that Medea gave? or What did you ask regarding Medea giving something to someone else?
1	The sentence is correctly formed and has a clear subject ("I") and object ("Anson"). There are no grammatical errors or awkward phrasings.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "tried" in this context should be followed by a gerund (-ing form of the verb), as it indicates an attempt to do something. Therefore, instead of "to poison," it should be "poisoning."	Medea tried poisoning her children with the nurse's help.
0	The verb tense used in this sentence is incorrect. The past tense of "to know" is "knew," so the sentence should read "I felt that I knew you." Alternatively, if you want to express present knowledge, it would be better to say "I feel that I know you." The current formulation mixes tenses unnecessarily.	I felt that I knew you.
0	The subject-auxiliary verb inversion required for a question has been applied incorrectly. In this case, "will" should be placed before "he," so the correct form of the question would be "Will he do it?" instead.	Will he do it?
0	The sentence is missing a main verb for the subject "I". It seems that it is intended to be "saw" instead of "ate", but even if we change it to "saw," there would still need to be a proper punctuation mark between the two clauses ("I saw" and "she was happy") for them to make sense as separate thoughts. A comma, semicolon, or period must be added.	I saw that she was happy. OR I saw she was happy.
1	The sentence "Anson believed himself to be handsome" is grammatically correct. Here, "himself" is a reflexive pronoun that refers back to the subject of the sentence, Anson. It indicates that Anson is performing the action of believing on himself. This type of construction is common when someone has an opinion about themselves.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It uses the past tense verb "arrived" followed by the preposition "about" to indicate an approximation of time, which is then specified as "six o'clock". This structure correctly conveys when the arriving occurred.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb tense used in this sentence is incorrect for the intended meaning. The past perfect tense ("had fought") would be more appropriate to indicate that one action happened before another action in the past. In its current form, "is having fought" suggests that Gilgamesh's fight with the dragon is ongoing or still happening now, which is unlikely if the story of Gilgamesh is being told in the past tense.	The sentence could be corrected as follows: "Gilgamesh had fought the dragon," indicating that he did so before some other event in the past. Alternatively, if the present perfect tense is desired, it might be written as "Gilgamesh has fought many dragons," implying a series of events leading up to the present moment.
0	The reflexive pronoun "himself" cannot be used as a subject of a sentence; it must refer to another noun or pronoun within the same clause. In this case, "Anson" is the subject, so the verb form "is" should be followed by the simple personal pronoun "he":	Anson thought that he was happy.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and there are no spelling errors. All of the words used make sense together in context. Additionally, the capitalization and punctuation are also appropriate for a complete sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It uses a correlative conjunction ("not...but") to connect two independent clauses. Each clause has a subject ("I" and "washing," respectively) and a verb ("might be going" and "is," respectively), so both clauses can stand alone as complete thoughts. Additionally, the word order follows standard English rules for declarative sentences.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The pronoun used after "liked" should be the objective form "me", rather than the reflexive form "myself". Using "myself" here implies that the speaker did something to themselves that they believed the other person would approve of. Therefore, the grammatically correct version of this sentence would be "I thought he liked me."	The sentence should be "I thought he liked me."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct and follows standard English syntax rules. It contains a subject ("the butler"), a verb ("sent"), and an object ("the poison to Dinah"). There are no misspelled words, incorrect word choices, or awkward phrasings.	The sentence is already correct.
0	This sentence contains redundancy because the phrases "happens to" and "to seem to be" have similar meanings, leading to a repetitive expression of uncertainty about Jason's health. Additionally, there is unnecessary use of nested infinitives.	Jason seems to be sick.
0	The sentence contains a grammatical error known as a pronoun case error. In the question, "what" is used as the subject of the verb "did," but it requires a preceding human noun to serve as its antecedent (the word it refers back to), which is missing here. A better way to rephrase the question would be "Who did you ask what?" or "What did you ask when you asked someone?" This ensures proper use of both pronouns and clarifies meaning.	Who did you ask what? or What did you ask when you asked someone?
1	The sentence "We linguists love to argue" is grammatically correct. It consists of a noun phrase ("we linguists") followed by a verb phrase ("love to argue"). There are no grammatical errors such as subject-verb agreement issues, incorrect word order, or missing punctuation marks.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence "He can will go" is grammatically incorrect because it uses both "can" and "will," which are both modal verbs expressing future tense. Using two modal verbs together is generally considered unacceptable in standard English. A more appropriate way to phrase this idea would be "He will be able to go" or simply "He will go."	The sentence should be either "He will go" or "He can go", depending on the intended meaning.
0	This sentence is missing an auxiliary verb, which is necessary to form a question in English. The correct structure would be "How + adjective + the + noun?" but since we have a verb instead of an adjective ("fierce" is a verb meaning "to make or become savage or violent"), it needs an auxiliary verb such as "do".	How fierce was the battle?
0	The sentence contains a grammatical error known as a question fragment. It consists of two questions asked separately but connected by the word "which", making it unclear what exactly is being asked. A better way to structure this would be to combine both questions into one coherent query. For instance: "Which king did you ask about, regarding the city he had invaded?"	The corrected sentence could be: "Which king did you ask about, regarding the city he had invaded?" if we want to keep the original meaning intact.
0	The plural form of "pig" should be used instead of adding an 's' after "old". Also, it would sound more natural to say "those ditch**es**", as there may be multiple ditches being referred to. Lastly, using "that" instead of "which" implies a defining clause rather than a non-defining one. Here, the information about the pigs is additional, so we use "which": "It is some disgruntled old pigs which humans love to eat in those ditches." However, I suspect what was intended here is something closer to: "Some disgruntled old pigs are the ones that humans love to eat in those ditches.", although this still sounds awkward.	The sentence could be revised several ways depending on context, e.g.: * Disgruntled old pigs often dwell in the very ditches people enjoy eating them from. * Those pigs that humans love to eat? They can sometimes be found grumbling in nearby ditches.
0	In the sentence "That banana is eating the monkey," the subject-verb agreement is incorrect. The subject of the sentence, "banana," is singular, but the verb "is" being used is for a plural subject. Additionally, it's grammatically impossible for a banana to eat a monkey as bananas do not have the capability to consume food.	The sentence cannot be corrected because it contains factual and logical errors. A more accurate sentence would describe actions performed by animals capable of such behavior.
0	The sentence is a fragment because it lacks a main verb and does not express a complete thought. It also contains exclamatory language which may be considered informal or aggressive depending on context.	Please dispose of those items properly.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "it," which refers to an unpleasant smell or situation indicated by "stinks." "That" introduces a subordinate clause modifying the subject, containing the noun "Aphrodite" and the adjective "omnipotent." Both words are used correctly here - Aphrodite is a mythological Greek goddess often associated with love and beauty, while omnipotent means all-powerful. Therefore, the sentence expresses dissatisfaction about Aphrodite being all-powerful.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Agamemnon seems to be a maniac" is grammatically correct. There are no spelling errors, punctuation errors, or grammatical errors. Additionally, the word choice is appropriate for standard English usage.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and well-formed. There are no spelling errors, punctuation marks are used appropriately, and subject-verb agreement is observed.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "I wondered who Medea had poisoned" is grammatically correct. Here's a breakdown of why: - "I wondered" is a present perfect tense verb phrase used to indicate past curiosity about something. - "who" is a relative pronoun introducing a clause ("who Medea had poisoned") that modifies an unknown antecedent. It functions as the subject of the embedded question. - "Medea" is a proper noun referring to a character from Greek mythology known for her vengeful acts. - "had poisoned" is a past perfect tense verb phrase indicating completed action before another past time reference point. In this case, it refers to an event prior to the speaker's wondering.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "I inquired when could we leave" is grammatically correct but it contains a word choice error which can lead to confusion. A more appropriate way of expressing this idea would be to use "asked" instead of "inquired", resulting in the sentence "I asked when we could leave". Both verbs have similar meanings, but "asked" is less formal than "inquired" and better suited for everyday conversation. However, if one wants to maintain formality in their language, they might prefer using "inquire", but in such cases, the structure of the question needs to change as well: "I inquired as to when we could leave".	Either "I asked when we could leave" or "I inquired as to when we could leave" depending on whether informal or formal tone is desired.
0	The sentence is missing a direct object after the verb "kicked". Without a direct object, it's unclear who or what was kicked. A complete sentence would be "They kicked the ball" or "They kicked him", for example.	They kicked something/someone.
0	The past tense of "to eat" is "ate," but it requires a subject that performs the action. In this case, the subject is "the monkey," which means the verb should be in third person singular form, i.e., "eats." Therefore, there's a mistake in the verb conjugation.	The monkey eats the banana.
0	The subject-auxiliary inversion is incorrect in this sentence. It should be "I would like to be able to swim" instead of "I would like to could swim". In a question or other construction where do/does comes before the subject, as in "Could I swim?", it's called subject-auxiliary inversion. But when using modal verbs such as can, could, may, might, must, shall, should, ought to, will, or would in statements, there shouldn't be any subject-auxiliary inversion.	The sentence should be "I would like to be able to swim."
1	The sentence "I kicked myself" is grammatically correct. It consists of a subject ("I") and a verb ("kicked"). The word "myself" is a reflexive pronoun which indicates that the action is performed by the same person as the subject. Therefore, there is no error in this sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Inanimate objects such as a bookcase cannot run; only living things can run. This is a grammatical error known as anthropomorphism, which is when human qualities are attributed to non-human entities.	The bookcase had tipped over.
1	The sentence "I shaved myself" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a simple sentence with a subject ("I") and a verb ("shaved"). Additionally, the reflexive pronoun "myself" is correctly used as the object of the sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The word "musclebound" needs to be one word instead of two words. Additionally, there should be a definite article before it. Here's why: "Musclebound" is an adjective describing someone who has large muscles due to excessive weightlifting but also lacking flexibility and coordination. Therefore, the correct sentence would be:	Anson became a musclebound individual.
