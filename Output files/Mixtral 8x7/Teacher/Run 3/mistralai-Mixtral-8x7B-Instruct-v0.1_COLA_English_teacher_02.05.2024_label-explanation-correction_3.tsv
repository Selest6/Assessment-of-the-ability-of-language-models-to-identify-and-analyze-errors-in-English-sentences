label	explanation	correction
1	This sentence is grammatically correct and understandable. It uses standard English words and follows proper syntax rules for word order and verb agreement.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "made" is incorrect in this context because it implies that someone or something caused the weights to make the rope stretch. However, since there's no mention of any external force causing the weights to stretch the rope, we need a different verb tense here.	The weights stretched the rope over the pulley.
1	The sentence "The mechanical doll wriggled itself loose" is grammatically correct. Here, we have a subject ("the mechanical doll"), a verb ("wriggled") and an object ("itself"). Additionally, the reflexive pronoun "itself" correctly refers back to the subject of the sentence, indicating that the action was performed by the same entity as the one being affected by it.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence follows the rules of subject-verb agreement, word order, and verb tense shifting in a hypothetical conditional construction. It expresses a clear idea using proper grammar.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in this sentence. In the first part of the sentence, "you" is plural, but "want" is singular. It should be changed to "wants" so it agrees with the plural subject "you". Additionally, there's a missing punctuation mark between two independent clauses.	As you eat the most, you want the least. (corrected version - added a semicolon) OR As you eat the most, so do you want the least.
0	This sentence is grammatically incorrect due to the use of "the" before a non-specific noun ("more"). It also contains a logical error because wanting something more typically leads to eating more rather than less. A better way to express this idea might be "The less one wants, the less one eats."	The lesson is already correct.
0	The sentence contains a subtle error related to subject-verb agreement and conditional construction. A corrected version would say "the more John eats, the more he has to pay" or "the more John eating, the more he has to pay," where the verb form agrees with its subjects and the conditionality is clearer.	The sentence should be "The more John eats, the more he has to pay" or "The more John eating, the more he has to pay".
0	This sentence needs a conjunction to connect the two independent clauses, "Mary listens to the Grateful Dead" and "she gets depressed". Without it, the relationship between these two ideas is unclear.	Mary listens to the Grateful Dead, and she gets depressed.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a complex sentence, which includes an independent clause ("the more she looked at pictures") and a dependent clause ("the angrier Mary got"). Moreover, each word is spelled correctly and punctuation marks are appropriately used.	The sentence is already correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It follows a common pattern of using an adjective ("higher") to compare two things ("stakes" and some unmentioned but understood standard), followed by the word "the," another adjective ("lower"), and a noun ("expectations"). The verb tense is consistent throughout the sentence as well.	The higher the stakes, the lower his expectations are.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It follows standard English syntax rules for subject-verb agreement, word order, and punctuation. Additionally, it conveys a clear meaning using idiomatic expressions ("the more...the less") appropriately.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "John was lots more obnoxious than Fred" is grammatically correct. Here, "lots more" functions as a comparative degree modifier, indicating that John has a greater degree of obnoxiousness compared to Fred. This structure follows standard usage rules for forming comparisons in English.	The sentence is already correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct because it follows standard subject-verb agreement rules and uses proper word order for a complex sentence. Additionally, its meaning is clear and unambiguous.	The sentence is already correct.
0	This sentence contains a common error known as "misrelated antecedents" because it incorrectly relates "the more" to both "Bill smokes" and "Susan hates him," resulting in a logically inconsistent statement. A corrected version of the sentence would relate "the more" only to one action or person.	The more Bill smokes, the more Susan's dislike for him grows.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. There are no spelling errors, punctuation errors, or grammatical errors. Additionally, the word order follows standard English syntax rules, and the verb tenses agree throughout the sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject ("every senator") is plural, so the verb ("seems") must also be plural to agree with the subject. The pronoun ("he") refers clearly to a singular male senator, which is appropriate in context. The word "corrupt" is used correctly as an adjective describing the noun "senators". There are no obvious spelling, punctuation, or syntax errors.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect due to a missing verb after "he likes". It seems that there is an attempt to express reason using "because", but it's not working here since we need two complete thoughts for this type of construction.	The corrected sentence could be one of the following options depending on what exactly is meant by the original sentence: a) Who does John visit because he likes visiting Sally? b) He visits Sally because he likes her.
1	The sentence has a simple subject ("Marianne") and negative auxiliary verb ("did not") which correctly expresses the past tense negation.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows the rule of using the auxiliary verb "have" with a past participle ("been") to form the present perfect tense, which can express actions that happened at an unspecified time before now. In this case, it's negated by adding "not" between "could" and "have". Therefore, the meaning conveyed is that he did not work at some point in the past.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The negation of the verb "can" is "cannot," which is typically written as one word. Additionally, when using the past perfect tense ("had worked"), we use a form of "have" followed by the past participle of the main verb, so the correct negative form would be "He could not have been working."	He could not have been working.
1	The sentence "You will believe Bob" is grammatically correct. There are no spelling errors, punctuation errors, or subject-verb agreement issues. Additionally, the word order follows standard English syntax rules.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and makes sense semantically. There are no spelling errors, punctuation marks are used correctly, and word order follows standard English syntax rules.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is correctly written using the past perfect tense ("had seen") to express an action completed before another point in time in the past. In this case, "I had seen" indicates that the speaker saw something prior to some unspecified event or experience in their life. This effectively contrasts the novelty of seeing such a unique place as Bangor against all previous experiences.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The pronoun "it" is incorrect in this context because a more specific object of the verb "looked up" is required. It seems like the speaker wants to say that Mickey looked something up, but we don't know what he looked up based on the provided information. Therefore, specifying the direct object would improve the clarity of the message.	The sentence could be corrected as follows: "Mickey looked up the word in the dictionary."
0	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in this sentence. "There" is singular, so it requires a singular verb form such as "tends," but instead we see the plural verb form "tended."	The sentence should read "There tended to be a lot of discussion." OR "There was often a lot of discussion."
1	The sentence "John tried to be a good boy" is grammatically correct. There are no spelling errors, punctuation errors, subject-verb agreement issues, or tense inconsistencies in this sentence. The word choice is also appropriate for the intended meaning of the sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "John is eager" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence, "John," is a proper noun and agrees with the verb "is," which is the linking verb used to describe the state of being of "John." Additionally, "eager" functions as an adjective describing the subject's current emotional or mental state.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and conveys a clear meaning. It follows subject-verb agreement rules as "John" is singular and "win" is also singular. Moreover, the word "to" indicates an infinitive form of the verb which is appropriate here.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "The box contained the ball from the tree" is grammatically correct. There is a clear subject ("the box"), verb ("contained"), and object ("the ball"). Additionally, there is a prepositional phrase modifying "ball" which provides more context about where it came from ("from the tree").	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "escape" requires a subject rather than an object to indicate the entity that is escaping. In this case, it seems as though the gas is doing the escaping, which does not make logical sense since gas cannot escape itself. Instead, we would say something like "the gas escaped from the tube," indicating that whatever is contained within the tube has escaped.	The gas escaped from the tube.
1	The sentence "Water bubbled up out of the kettle" is grammatically correct. It has a clear subject ("water"), verb ("bubbled"), and modifying phrases ("up," "out of the kettle"). There are no spelling errors or awkward phrasings.	The sentence is already correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It contains a simple subject ("the tub") and a predicate verb ("leaked"), as well as a direct object ("water"). There are no spelling errors or awkward phrasings to correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "do" is unnecessary here because the subject of the second clause ("the water") is the same as the subject of the first clause ("what"). Additionally, we use the past tense form "filled" instead of "fill" when talking about a completed action in the past.	The water filled the bottle.
0	The verb "do" is unnecessary in this sentence because the subject ("the water") and the verb ("fill") are directly linked by the preposition "to," which can connect them without needing another verb. Therefore, a more concise version of this sentence would be "The water filled the whole bottle."	The water filled the whole bottle.
0	In this sentence, there is a preposition error. Instead of saying "the fluid free," it should be "freely" to indicate that the action is done without restraint. Also, we usually use "leak something out" instead of just "leak something".	The tank leaked out the fluid freely.
0	The verb tense used in this sentence does not correctly convey the intended meaning. In this context, the action of laying something down has likely already been completed; therefore, we need to use a past participle instead of the base form of the verb.	John laid the ball in the box. Confidence level: 98%
1	The sentence "John owns the book" is grammatically correct. It contains a proper subject-verb agreement, as well as appropriate use of tense, article, and preposition.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It uses a pair of parallel verbs ("persuaded" and "to stay") to connect two infinitive phrases as objects of the transitive verb "persuaded". Each infinitive phrase contains its own subject ("Mary" and "Sue"). This structure is clear and concise, making it an effective way to express the intended meaning.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It contains a subordinating conjunction ("although") to connect two clauses. The first clause "Most people probably consider" is in the present tense and active voice, while the second clause "the courts didn't actually find Klaus guilty of murder" is in the past tense and passive voice. This contrast adds emphasis to the difference between public opinion and legal findings.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence follows all of the standard rules for English grammar and punctuation, so it's a grammatically correct sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence contains two errors related to verb tense agreement and word choice. Firstly, using "probably" implies uncertainty about a future action, but "will" expresses certainty; it would be better to use "is likely to" instead of "will." Secondly, learning French perfectly right away is unlikely, so I suggest changing "perfectly" to "fluently."	Clearly, John is likely to immediately learn French fluently.
0	In English, when we have two objects of a verb, we usually use a double object construction where the indirect object comes before the direct object. Therefore, the sentence should be "Sue gave Bill a book" instead of "Sue gave to Bill a book". The preposition "to" is unnecessary here because the indirect object ("Bill") is already expressed by a noun rather than a pronoun. Moreover, if we include "to," it must come after the direct object as in "Sue gave a book to Bill."	Sue gave Bill a book.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("the men") and a verb tense that indicates future action ("will leave"). There are no spelling errors or misplaced words, so it meets standard English usage rules.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "John went home" is grammatically correct. It consists of a proper subject ("John") and a past tense verb ("went"), which agrees with the subject in number. Additionally, there is no missing punctuation, capitalization, or word choice errors.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The adverb "seriously" does not fit grammatically in this context. It would be more appropriate to say "They represented her sincerely to the dean as a genuine linguist," or simply "They represented her to the dean as a genuine linguist."	The sentence corrected would be either of these two options: * They represented her sincerely to the dean as a genuine linguist. * They represented her to the dean as a genuine linguist.
0	The sentence contains a mistake in subject-verb agreement. In English, the verb must agree in number with the subject of the sentence. Here, the subject is "we" but the verb used is "us," which is incorrect. A plural pronoun such as "we" requires a plural verb such as "love."	We love them.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no spelling errors, punctuation marks are used correctly, and the word order follows standard English syntax rules.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Mary intended John to go abroad" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "Mary" is the subject of the sentence. It is a proper noun and indicates who performed the action. * "intended" is the verb of the sentence, indicating what Mary did. This is a past tense form of the verb "to intend", which means to have something as a plan or purpose. * "John" is the direct object of the sentence. It receives the action of the verb. * "to go abroad" is an infinitive phrase acting as the complement of the verb "intend". An infinitive phrase can function as a noun, adjective, or adverb within a sentence. In this case, it acts as a noun since it completes the meaning of the verb "intend".	The sentence is already correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The past perfect tense ("had kissed") is used appropriately to indicate that the action of kissing happened before another past action. In this case, the other past action is implied but not stated in the sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence contains a comma splice error. A coordinating conjunction ("either") must be preceded by a semicolon or followed by a comma when connecting two independent clauses. In this case, no semicolon is used before "either," making it incorrect. Additionally, there seems to be a missing main verb for the second clause; if we assume "can come" is implied after "Fred won't", the corrected version would still require proper punctuation.	I can't believe Fred won't; neither can I. (If assuming 'come' as implied) OR I can't believe Fred won't either come; nor can I. (For clarity)
0	The second part of the conjunction ("and") requires a coordinating subject and verb to maintain parallel structure. In this case, "I" is the subject and "want" is the verb for the second clause, but there is no specific object mentioned after "also want". Therefore, it would be more appropriate to say "I also want to read it" instead.	John wants to read Fred's story, and I also want to read it.
0	The second part of the sentence "who to" is incorrect because it lacks a verb after "who". In English, we need to include a verb after every pronoun when using them as subjects.	We wanted to invite someone, but we couldn't decide who to invite.
1	The sentence follows all of the necessary grammatical rules for proper English syntax. It contains a subject ("Mary") and a verb ("will read") followed by an object ("Fred's story"), and it uses appropriate punctuation to separate clauses. Additionally, the use of the coordinating conjunction "and" connects two independent clauses together effectively.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence contains a subject-verb agreement error. In the clause "Holly shouldn't," the singular form of the verb ("shouldn't") does not agree with its plural subject "Holly".	Mary claimed that eating cabbage, Holly shouldn't **eat**. (or alternatively, "Mary claimed that Holly shouldn't eat cabbage.")
0	The sentence contains a common grammatical error known as a pronoun agreement issue. In the second clause of the sentence ("I also came to be"), "to be" does not form a complete verb tense when used with the subject "I". A more appropriate way to construct this sentence would be "Mary came to be introduced by the bartender and I came too," or "Mary was introduced by the bartender and I was introduced as well."	Mary came to be introduced by the bartender and I came too.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It has a subject ("I"), a verb ("can" in the conditional mood), and an object ("it"). The word order is also correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The error in this sentence lies in the pronoun agreement between the subject and verb. In the second clause of the sentence ("Sally does too"), "does" serves as a substitute for the main verb in the first clause, which is "bother." However, "bother" is a third-person singular verb, while "does" implies a plural subject. Since "Sally" is a singular noun, we need to use the corresponding singular form of the auxiliary verb instead.	Joe's neuroses bother his patrons, and so does Sally. In this corrected version, I replaced "too" with "so," since it better reflects the meaning and grammatical structure of the original sentence. Additionally, by using "does" alongside "so," the pronoun agreement issue has been resolved.
0	The sentence contains a pronoun ambiguity error. It is unclear whether "it" refers to "reading the book" or "choosing the book". This can be fixed by rephrasing the second part of the sentence as follows: "which book Lilly read for him instead."	I know which book José didn't read for class, and which book Lilly read for him instead.
0	The second part of the sentence contains multiple errors. "And this is the one" implies that what follows will be a noun phrase referring to something previously mentioned, but instead there is a clause ("which Fred won't do it"). Additionally, "do it" is unnecessary here; if Fred won't review the book, the sentence could simply say "this is the one which Fred won't review".	This is the book which Bob reviewed, and this is the one which Fred won't review.
0	The second part of the sentence contains a mistake related to subject-verb agreement. The verb "hadn't" does not agree with its plural subject "you". It should be "hadn't **both**" if we want to keep using singular forms for "Bob" and "Mag", but it would sound more natural to say "books" instead of "which book" twice and use a plural form of the verb: "and which books Bob said that you hadn't read".	I know which book Mag read, and which books Bob said that you hadn't read.
0	The sentence contains a few errors. In the first clause, it should be "I know which book **Maggie** read," as "Mag" is short for Maggie but does not stand alone without the last letter. Additionally, there is no need for a comma after "report." A better way to rephrase the whole sentence would be: "I know which books Maggie and Bob each read; your report is the one you haven't shown me yet."	I know which book Maggie read, and which book Bob read. Here is your report that you hadn't looked over yet.
1	The sentence follows all of the necessary grammatical rules for standard English. It uses proper verb tense agreement, subject-verb agreement, punctuation, spelling, and word choice. Additionally, it contains a clear meaning and is structured logically.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence contains a redundancy error. The word "did" is unnecessary because the verb tense change from past simple ("talked") to past perfect ("had talked") would be sufficient to indicate the sequence of events. Also, there's a missing comma before the conjunction "after".	Rusty talked about himself only after Mary had talked about him.
0	The second instance of "talk" should be "talked" to maintain parallel structure. In the first part of the sentence, "talked" is used as the past tense of "talk," so it should also be used in the second part for consistency.	Fred talked about everything before Rusty did talk about something. (It would be better to say "before Rusty talked about something.")
1	The sentence "John often meets Mary" is grammatically correct. There are no spelling errors, punctuation errors, or grammatical errors such as subject-verb agreement or tense consistency.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "perceive" needs to be followed by a preposition such as "as," "that," or "to" before introducing a clause. Additionally, there seems to be no subject expressing who or what is doing the action of perceiving. A better way to construct this sentence could be: "It is easy to perceive the problem."	It is easy to perceive the problem.
1	The sentence "A hundred men surrounded the fort" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a sentence which includes a subject ("a hundred men"), an auxiliary verb if needed ("did," "have," etc.), and a predicate ("surrounded the fort"). Moreover, all words are spelled correctly, and there are no punctuation errors.	The sentence is already correct.
0	In English, we do not use the first person pronoun ("me") as the subject of a sentence; instead, we use the corresponding form for the subject ("I"). The verb must agree in number with its subject, so it should be "elected" rather than "elects". A correct version would therefore be "They elected me", or if referring to past events, "They elected me." or "They had elected me."	They elected me.
0	The sentence contains a misplaced modifier, which makes it unclear what the subject of the sentence is referring to. Specifically, "that John was incompetent" appears to modify "which," but "which" refers back to "report," creating confusion. A possible interpretation could be that the report itself was incompetent, rather than John. To fix this error, one can rephrase the question as follows: Which report did he submit, stating that John was incompetent?	Which report did he submit, stating that John was incompetent?
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and makes sense in context. There is a clear subject ("Mary"), a verb tense that indicates a past preference that continues into the present ("has always preferred"), and two objects of comparison ("lemons" and "limes").	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence is missing a verb for the subject "the cats," making it grammatically incorrect. It appears as though there might be some confusion between relative clauses and independent clauses. In order to make the meaning clearer, we can add a suitable verb such as 'to roam' after 'cats'. Also, a preposition ('out') cannot directly follow the verb 'whine', so I will remove it from the corrected version of the sentence.	He let the cats that were whining roam.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It has a question form with appropriate word order and punctuation marks. Also, it includes a proper subject ("Bill") and a helping verb ("did buy"). Hence, there's no need for correction here.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence follows all of the standard rules for English grammar and punctuation. It contains a subject ("Mary"), verb ("saw"), and object ("the boy") in the form of a simple declarative sentence. Additionally, there are no spelling errors or misused words.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The past participle of the verb "give" should be "given," but it's misspelled as "griver" in the original sentence. Additionally, there is a missing article before "John."	A proof that the claim had been given was provided by the fact that John had lied.
0	The sentence contains multiple errors in word order and preposition use. In the first part of the sentence, "attributed to" requires a person as its object, but here it has been used with a short circuit. Additionally, there should be a comma after "circuit". Lastly, instead of saying "which was caused by", we can simply say "caused by".	The fire, which destroyed most of my factory, was attributed to a short circuit caused by an overloaded transducer.
0	In this sentence, there is a missing preposition before the word "Dartmouth". It would be grammatically correct if it said "the proposal to build a sidewalk from Dartmouth to Smith" or "the proposal to build a sidewalk between Dartmouth and Smith", but as written it lacks clarity about their relationship without additional context.	The mayor regarded as absurd the proposal to build a sidewalk from Dartmouth to Smith. OR The mayor regarded as absurd the proposal to build a sidewalk between Dartmouth and Smith.
0	The sentence contains a common grammatical error known as a dangling modifier. In this case, "to remain a secret" is a prepositional phrase acting as an adverbial of reason, but it does not have a clear referent within the sentence. It seems to modify "Bill," but that's grammatically impossible because "left" requires a direct object. To fix the problem, we need to make it clear what or whom Bill left for.	I want Bill to leave so that his departure remains a secret.
0	The sentence contains multiple errors. Specifically, there is a repeated word ("drives") and a missing article before "man". Additionally, it appears that "Tom" is intended to be the subject of a verb, but no appropriate verb exists in this sentence for him to act upon.	I know a man whom Tom drives.
0	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in this sentence. "Cats" is a plural noun, so the verb should be "are" instead of "is". Additionally, it's generally best to avoid using negative constructions such as "drowning cats, which is against the law," especially when discussing potentially distressing subjects like animals in danger. A more empathetic way to frame the sentence would be: "It's illegal to endanger cats by drowning them; rescuing these animals can be challenging."	It's illegal to endanger cats by drowning them; rescuing these animals can be challenging.
0	The sentence contains a redundancy error. The word "else" is unnecessary because "nothing" already means there's no additional information to be shared.	Muriel said nothing more than that she had been insulted. Or alternatively, Muriel merely said that she had been insulted.
0	The subject and object of the sentence have been reversed; it should be "Rutherford understands himself" rather than "Himself is understood by Rutherford". In active voice, the doer of the action comes first, followed by the verb, and then the receiver of the action. Therefore, we say "John eats an apple," not "*An apple is eaten by John.*" Here, "himself" refers to Rutherford, so he must come before the verb.	Rutherford understands himself.
1	The sentence "I feel that Arch will show up" is grammatically correct. Here's a brief explanation of why it's correct: - The subject of the sentence is "I," which is a first-person singular pronoun. This means that the verb must be in the base form to agree with the subject. In this case, the verb "feel" is in its base form, so it agrees with the subject. - The subordinating conjunction "that" introduces a clause ("Arch will show up") which functions as the direct object of the main verb "feel". The verb within the subordinate clause follows the sequence of tense rule correctly - the auxiliary verb "will" indicates future time reference for both clauses. - The predicate of the sentence is "will show up", where the modal verb "will" expresses futurity, followed by the third person singular present tense verb "show". Since the subject of the subordinate clause is "Arch" (third person singular), the verb "show" is inflected appropriately with "-s" ending. Therefore, since there are no grammatical errors in the sentence, we can conclude that "I feel that Arch will show up" is grammatically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	In the sentence "The proof this set is recursive is difficult," there is a missing article before the word "set." A more grammatically correct version of this sentence would be "The proof of this set's recursiveness is difficult" or "This set's recursive nature is hard to prove."	The corrected sentence could be either "The proof of this set's recursiveness is difficult" or "This set's recursive nature is hard to prove."
0	In this sentence, there is a lack of clarity regarding whether “the lute” is one of the objects of “plays” or if it modifies the verb phrase to indicate what kind of playing Henry does. To clarify this ambiguity, we need to use a conjunction such as “and” between “lute” and “sings.”	The madrigals that Henry plays and sings on the lute sound terrible.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and makes sense in context.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence contains a grammatical error known as a run-on sentence. There should be punctuation or a conjunction between the two independent clauses to connect them properly. Here, there is no conjunction ("and" or "but") and only a question mark separating the two clauses, making it difficult for readers to understand the intended meaning of the sentence.	Where did you go, and who ate what? Or, alternatively: Where did you go? Who ate what?
0	The sentence contains multiple grammatical errors. There is a missing determiner before both "boy" and "guardian," making it unclear who is being referred to. Additionally, there is no verb in the main clause of the sentence, so it is unclear what action is being taken. Lastly, the word order in the second half of the sentence ("did we elect guardian's employer president?") is incorrect. It should be "elected [position] by [group]".	We elected which boy as the president of the guardians' employer?
0	The word "sane" requires a comparative form such as "how sane is Peter compared to..." or "how much saner is Peter than...", so the original sentence is grammatically incorrect without it.	How sane is Peter compared to his brother?
0	The sentence contains a minor error related to specificity. Both instances of "Route 150" can be replaced by "the route" for better clarity since there could potentially be more than one Route 150. This would make it clearer which particular Route 150 is being referred to each time. Also, using "the" before "River" and "Hudson River" helps avoid any potential ambiguity regarding the exact rivers being mentioned.	The corrected sentence would be: "I live at the place where the route crosses the river, and my dad lives at the place where the route crosses the Hudson River too."
0	The pronoun 'it' in the second part of the sentence does not clearly refer to anything specific. It seems to be referring back to 'Route 150', but in fact, Route 150 cannot cross a river since it is a road. Therefore, there is some ambiguity in the sentence which needs to be resolved.	The sentence could be corrected as follows: "I live at the place where Route 150 crosses the Hudson River, and my dad lives nearby as well." This removes any confusion caused by the original sentence.
0	The verb "to make up" requires a direct object in this context, as it means to reconcile after a disagreement. A more appropriate way to ask the question would be "Who is she trying to make up with now?"	Who is she trying to make up with now?
0	The past participle form of the verb "get" should be "gotten" only when referring to obtaining or receiving something. In this case, it looks like what's intended is for "wind" to be the subject, but "wind" cannot actively get anything. Additionally, there seems to have been some confusion between passive voice ("was got") and active voice ("got"). A better way to phrase this would be "A plot to negotiate an honorable end to the war in Vietnam had the wind taken out of it."	A plot to negotiate an honorable end to the war in Vietnam had the wind taken out of it.
0	The sentence is missing a preposition after "to" to indicate who Mike talked about politics to.	Mike talked about politics yesterday to my friends and me. OR Mike talked about politics to my friends yesterday.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There is a clear subject ("the reporters"), a verb tense that indicates future expectation ("would fire"), and a direct object of the verb ("some teachers"). The sentence structure follows standard English syntax rules.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The pronoun used to refer to the person wearing the hat should be consistent throughout the sentence. In this case, "she" is used as the pronoun, but there is no previous mention of a female individual. Based on the name "Mike," it seems that a male individual is being referred to. Therefore, the use of "she" in this context is incorrect. It would be more appropriate to say, "Which hat did Mike quip he never wore?" if referring to a male individual named Mike.	Which hat did Mike quip he never wore?
0	The sentence contains a grammatical error known as a dangling modifier. The clause "which girl" does not have a clear antecedent; it seems to modify "Mike," which cannot be correct. Additionally, "quip" here is used incorrectly - it should be replaced with "noticed" or some other verb indicating observation rather than speech. A corrected version of this sentence might read: "Which girl did Mike notice never wore this hat?"	Which girl did Mike notice never wore this hat?
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It has a clear subject ("we"), verb ("donated"), direct object ("wire") and indirect object ("the convicts"). Additionally, there is a prepositional phrase modifying the action of the verb ("to build cages with"). All elements of the sentence work together smoothly without any grammatical errors.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence contains a double negative ("won't" and "some"), which can make the meaning of the sentence unclear. It would be better to use a positive form instead.	The sentence should read "I will have some money."
0	The sentence contains a pronoun ("somebody") that does not agree in number with its antecedent. In standard English, it should be either "Do you believe the claim that someone was looking for something?" (singular) or "Do you believe the claims that some people were looking for something?" (plural).	Do you believe the claim that someone was looking for something?
0	The sentence contains a minor error known as pronoun ambiguity. It is unclear whether "he" forced the speaker to give money to "her," or if "he" attempted to force the speaker to part with their own money. To avoid confusion, consider rephrasing the sentence using clearer language. For example: "He didn't succeed in forcing me to give her any of my money."	He didn't succeed in forcing me to give her any of my money.
0	The sentence contains a common error known as a double negative. In standard English, two negatives create a positive meaning, so the sentence "That Sam sometimes didn't sleep must have pleased somebody" implies that someone was happy when Sam did sleep. However, it seems that the intended meaning of the sentence is to express that there was likely someone who was pleased when Sam could not sleep. Therefore, we need to remove one of the negatives to convey the intended message correctly.	The sentence "That Sam sometimes slept must have displeased somebody" conveys the desired meaning accurately by replacing 'didn't sleep' with 'slept,' which emphasizes the contrast between Sam sleeping and not sleeping.
0	The pronoun used to refer back to the subject of a sentence should match its grammatical number. In this case, 'himself' is a reflexive pronoun for singular third-person masculine nouns, but 'Winston' is plural. Therefore, we need to use 'themselves' instead.	I talked to Winston about themselves.
0	The first clause of the sentence contains a pronoun ambiguity error - it is unclear who 'him' refers to. Additionally, there is no comma splice between the two clauses; instead, a coordinating conjunction ('but') is used without a preceding comma. This punctuation mistake can lead to confusion about how the second clause relates to the first one.	The sentence should read as follows: "That the fuzz wanted him to worry John, but they didn't want to concern Mary, worried her." Here, I have clarified what 'him' referred to by changing it to 'him to worry John', added a missing coordinating conjunction 'to' before 'concern', changed 'the fuzz wanted her' to 'they didn't want to concern Mary', corrected the form of the verb from singular (worry) to plural (worry), and finally separated both clauses using commas for better clarity.
0	The verb tense used in this sentence is incorrect. "I'll work" uses a contraction of "I will work," which indicates future tense. However, "will be working" also refers to the future but implies continuous action. Therefore, both verbs should agree in their form. To fix this issue, one can say either "If Sam works on it, I will too" or "If Sam is going to work on it, so am I".	The sentence is already correct if revised as follows: "Firstly, write 'Label:' and return the label, then write 'Explanation:' and explain your answer. After that write 'Correct Sentence:' and return the corrected sentence (if the original sentence was not correct), or write 'The sentence is already correct.' (if the original sentence was correct). If I am working on it, Sam will too."
0	The verb tense is inconsistent within the sentence. 'has been writing' should be changed to 'wrote.'	She wrote a letter yesterday after she had finished her homework."
0	The preposition "with" cannot be followed by another preposition such as "for". Instead of saying "a knife with which for", we say "a knife with which to". This error occurs because people sometimes mistakenly think they can use two prepositions together when connecting a noun to its intended purpose.	Here's a knife with which to cut up the onions.
0	The word "which" introduces a clause that describes additional information about something previously mentioned, typically separated by a comma. However, it requires the subject of the clause to be essential for understanding its meaning. In this case, using "that" instead would make more sense because it's used when introducing a clause that cannot be left out without changing the intended meaning. Thus, the original sentence is grammatically incorrect.	Fluffy is sick, which not everyone knows *OR* Fluffy is sick, that not everyone knows. (Although less common, the second option can still work if emphasis on 'not everyone knows' is desired.)
0	The sentence "Maxwell is quite a doctor" is grammatically incorrect because of the word "quite". In this context, "quite" implies that Maxwell has some degree of being a doctor but does not fully possess those qualities. This creates confusion since one cannot partially be a doctor; they either have a medical degree and practice medicine or do not. A more appropriate way to express admiration for Maxwell's skills as a physician would be "Maxwell is an excellent doctor" or "Maxwell is a very skilled doctor," which convey approval without casting doubt on his professional status.	The sentence should read "Maxwell is an excellent doctor" or "Maxwell is a very skilled doctor."
0	There is a superfluous comma after "tall" which creates confusion about whether it applies to both women or just the second one. Also, there is another unnecessary comma before "and". Each of these issues causes unclear syntax and makes it difficult for readers to follow the intended meaning.	The younger woman might have been tall and the older one definitely was blond.
0	There is a punctuation error in the sentence which affects readability and clarity. The sentence contains two complete thoughts ("Sally is tall, and may be blond" and "Sheila is short, and definitely is, blond") but they are not properly separated by a period. This makes it difficult to understand where one thought ends and another begins.	The corrected sentence would be: "Sally is tall, and may be blond. Sheila is short, and definitely is blonde." I added a period after "blond" and changed "blond" to "blonde," as "blonde" is typically used for females.
0	The verb "try" should be followed by a base form of the verb, so it should be "I have to try and finish grading..." instead of "I have to try to finish".	The corrected sentence is: "I have to try and finish grading some papers."
0	There is a repetition of the preposition "for" which makes the sentence ungrammatical. Also, "to be planned" does not make sense in this context as it suggests that the action of putting on the socks is something that needs to be scheduled or organized beforehand.	The socks are ready for you to put on.
1	The sentence "It is easy to play sonatas on this violin" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "it," which refers to the idea that playing sonatas on this violin is easy. The verb is "is," which agrees with the singular subject. The predicate adjective is "easy," which modifies the subject. The prepositional phrase "on this violin" tells us where it is easy to play sonatas. All of these elements come together to form a complete, grammatical sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect because there is a missing article before the word "sonatas". In English, we need to specify whether we're talking about "a" sonata or "the" sonatas. Therefore, the corrected version of the sentence would be either "This violin is difficult to play a sonata on" or "This violin is difficult to play the sonatas on", depending on the intended meaning.	This violin is difficult to play a sonata on.
0	The sentence is a fragment because it lacks a main verb for the subject "my father". Also, there is no punctuation between "my father" and the end of the sentence.	Either "My mother is easy to please, and she also pleases my father." or "My mother, who is easy to please, pleases my father as well." would be grammatically correct.
0	The sentence contains a comma splice error, which occurs when two independent clauses are incorrectly joined by a comma. In this case, "it had started to rain" and "he had no umbrella" are both independent clauses, but they are improperly connected with just a comma.	Either use a period to separate the two independent clauses into two sentences: "Poor Bill. It had started to rain and he had no umbrella," or join them using a conjunction such as 'and': "Poor Bill, for it had started to rain and he had no umbrella."
0	The second part of the sentence, "that robbery," is a fragment because it lacks a proper subject-verb pair and necessary context. It appears to be disconnected from the first part of the sentence, which states, "That the cops spoke to the janitor about it yesterday is terrible." To make the entire statement grammatically correct, we need to connect these two parts properly.	The sentence should either read as follows: 1. That the cops spoke to the janitor about the robbery yesterday is terrible. 2. That the cops spoke to the janitor yesterday is terrible; they discovered a robbery had taken place.
0	The sentence contains multiple errors. Firstly, there is no clear subject for the first clause ("Every student"), making it unclear who or what is being referred to as a "swinger". Additionally, the use of "he" implies that only male students are being referred to, which is incorrect since "every student" includes all genders. Finally, the word "wears" should be changed to "wear" to agree with the plural noun "students".	Every student wearing socks is a swinger. Alternatively, if referring specifically to male students, one could say: "Every male student wearing socks is a swinger."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and has a clear subject ("that girl"), verb ("was given"), and object ("my binoculars"). There are no grammatical errors such as misspelled words, incorrect word usage, or improper punctuation.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Bill didn't allege that Roger had eaten anything" is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("Bill"), an auxiliary verb ("didn't"), a main verb ("allege"), a conjunction ("that"), another subject ("Roger"), and a clause containing a past perfect tense verb form ("had eaten"). All of these elements are used correctly and the sentence follows standard English grammar rules.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It uses the subjunctive mood correctly, where we use the base form of the verb after "should" when talking about hypothetical situations. In this case, the speaker is discussing the hypothetical situation of someone disliking food working in a deli, so "eats" becomes "eat". Great job!	The sentence is already correct.
0	The pronoun "his" in this context can be misleading as it may imply only males talk in their sleep after buying something on credit. To make it grammatically correct and inclusive, we need to replace "his" with a gender-neutral term such as "their". This change ensures both men and women are included in the statement without assuming the gender of those who buy things on credit.	Everybody around here who ever buys anything on credit talks in their sleep.
0	The sentence contains a pronoun ambiguity error. It is unclear whether the speaker cannot remember the name of one person who had misgivings or if they cannot remember the names of multiple people who each had misgivings. To clarify, we could rephrase as follows: "I can't remember the name of the person who had misgivings" or "I can't remember the names of those who had misgivings."	I can't remember the name of the person who had misgivings.
0	The sentence contains a grammatical error. In negative constructions such as this one, we use neither/nor instead of not to coordinate two elements. Therefore, the corrected version should be: "No writer nor playwright meets in Vienna."	The sentence should be: "No writer nor playwright meets in Vienna."
0	The sentence contains a grammatical error. The subject of the sentence is "No writer, nor any playwright," which implies a negative polarity. However, the verb "meets" does not agree with this negative polarity; it should be in the plural form to match the subject. Additionally, there should be no comma before the conjunction "nor."	The corrected sentence would read as follows: "No writer nor any playwright meets in Vienna." However, since the intended meaning seems to suggest that neither group meets in Vienna, it might be better to rephrase the sentence altogether for clarity. For example: "Neither writers nor playwrights meet in Vienna."
0	The sentence contains a double negative, which can lead to confusion about the intended meaning. The negatives come from both "not" and "any," so we should remove one of them to make the sentence clearer. We could say either "That you will marry a student is not certain" or "It's uncertain whether you will marry any student."	It's uncertain whether you will marry any student.
1	The sentence "Felicia kicked the ball off the bench" is grammatically correct. Here, 'kicked' is a past tense verb which describes the action performed by the subject 'Felicia'. The direct object of the sentence is 'the ball', which receives the action of kicking. Finally, 'off the bench' indicates where the ball went after being kicked, making it an adverbial phrase. Thus, all elements of the sentence work together to convey a clear meaning.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "I sent the package halfway around the world" is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple sentence structure where the subject ("I") is followed by the verb ("sent") and the object ("the package"). Additionally, the adverbial clause "halfway around the world" provides more information about how far the package was sent. There are no grammatical errors such as subject-verb agreement issues, incorrect word usage, or missing punctuation marks.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence "Sam gave the ball out of the basket" is grammatically incorrect because it uses a preposition ("of") instead of a verb to indicate what action Sam took regarding the basket. A more appropriate way to express this idea would be by saying "Sam took the ball out of the basket" or "Sam passed the ball out of the basket," depending on context.	Sam took the ball out of the basket.
1	The sentence "Sam offered the ball out of the basket" is grammatically correct. Here, "offered" is the past tense form of the verb "offer," which means to give something to someone voluntarily. The word "the" before both "ball" and "basket" indicates specific objects, making it clear what exactly Sam gave from the basket. Moreover, the preposition "out of" followed by the location "the basket" conveys the source or origin of where the ball came from. Overall, the sentence has a proper subject-verb agreement, clear object identification, and appropriate use of prepositions for directional expression. Therefore, I will mark this as a grammatically correct sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Park Square has a festive air" is grammatically correct. It consists of a subject ("Park Square"), a verb ("has"), and a complement ("a festive air"). All elements agree in number, and the word order follows standard English syntax rules. There are no spelling errors or misplaced words.	The sentence is already correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It follows the standard subject-verb-object structure of an English sentence, where "the worker" is the subject, "will have" is the verb, and "a job" is the object. There are no grammatical errors such as misspellings, incorrect word usage, or misplaced punctuation marks.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence contains a pronoun agreement error. The plural noun "comments" requires a plural verb form for grammatical concordance. Thus, the correct verb form after "that" should be "are," not "is." Additionally, there is no need for the comma before "to you" because it interrupts the direct address of the second person pronoun "you."	No one can forgive that comments to you. Or alternatively: The sentence is almost correct; however, it should read as follows: "No one can forgive that comment to you."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and understandable. It uses proper verb tenses ("launched," "blew") and prepositions ("to" and "before"). Additionally, the subject-verb agreement is consistent throughout the sentence. There are no spelling errors or awkward phrasings.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no spelling errors, punctuation errors, subject-verb agreement issues, or tense inconsistencies. Additionally, the word "then" appropriately indicates a sequence of events, connecting two independent clauses with appropriate parallel structure.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb tense used in this sentence is incorrect. The past participle form of the verb 'lend' should be used when referring to a completed action in the past, so it should be 'I had lent the book partway to Tony.' Alternatively, if you want to use simple past tense, it would be better to say 'I lent the book to Tony,' without using 'partway'.	The sentence should be either 'I had lent the book partway to Tony' or 'I lent the book to Tony'.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("the farmer"), a verb ("loaded") and an object ("the cart"). Additionally, it includes a prepositional phrase ("with apples") which modifies how or where the action of loading took place.	The sentence is already correct.
0	In this context, "dump" implies discarding something carelessly or without consideration for where it lands. It's unlikely a farmer would do this to their own apple cart. A more appropriate verb might be "unloaded," which suggests the careful transfer of goods from one place to another.	The farmer unloaded the cart with apples.
0	The verb "carved" does not agree with its subject "Martha". Since Martha is singular, we need to use the third person singular form of the verb, which is "carves", not "carved". Additionally, it's generally considered inappropriate to refer to a baby as "the baby," so we can rephrase the sentence to avoid doing so.	Martha crafted her son a wooden toy.
1	In this sentence, the verb "cuts" agrees with its subject "the bread," which is singular. Additionally, the word order is correct and there are no missing or extra words. Therefore, I would rate this sentence as grammatically correct.	The bread cuts easily. Confidence level: 95%.
0	The verb "broke" does not make sense in this context when used with the preposition "on". Additionally, it's not possible for a person to be broken. It seems like there might have been some confusion between breaking something accidentally and causing harm or injury to someone. A more appropriate way to express what happened could be: "Janet injured Bill's finger."	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Janet broke the cup" is grammatically correct. It contains a proper subject ("Janet"), a verb ("broke") and an object ("the cup"). All of these elements agree with each other in number and tense, making for a complete and coherent thought.	The sentence is already correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct and follows standard English syntax rules. The subject ("the visitor") is performing the action described by the verb ("rang"), which is in past tense as indicated by the suffix "-ed". Additionally, there is a direct object of the verb, namely "the bell", indicating who or what the visitor performed the action on.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence is missing necessary context to be grammatically complete. It's unclear what action is being performed on what object. For example, a more clear version of the sentence would be "We pulled the car free" or "We freed ourselves".	The sentence needs additional context for correction. A possible corrected version could be "We pulled free the jammed drawer" if we assume the intended meaning is pulling something loose.
1	The sentence "That movie always shocks people" is grammatically correct. There is a subject ("that movie"), an auxiliary verb ("does") which is implied, and a predicate ("shocks people"). The tense of the verb agrees with the time frame indicated by the adverb "always," and there are no spelling or punctuation errors.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "That movie always shocks" is grammatically correct. It consists of a subordinating conjunction ("that"), a noun phrase ("that movie") acting as the subject, an auxiliary verb ("always") functioning as an adverbial of frequency, and a main verb ("shocks"). All elements are arranged correctly according to syntactic rules.	The sentence is already correct.
0	In English, we need to use a preposition such as 'to' or 'into' after the verb 'come'. The correct form of the sentence would be 'Sharon came into the room.'	Sharon came into the room.
1	The sentence follows all of the necessary grammatical rules for standard American English. It has a clear subject ("Bill"), verb ("sent"), and object ("a package"). Additionally, it uses proper prepositions ("to") to indicate direction.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "That acorn will grow into an oak tree" is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("that acorn"), a helping verb ("will"), a main verb ("grow"), and an object ("an oak tree"). Additionally, it uses appropriate prepositions and articles. There are no spelling errors, punctuation errors, or word choice errors. Therefore, I would rate this sentence as being grammatically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "He turned into a frog" is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("he"), a verb ("turned") and an object ("a frog"). The tense of the verb indicates past action which fits the context. There are no spelling errors and the word order is correct.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence follows the rules of standard English grammar and syntax, so it is considered grammatically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "threw" suggests that the direct object of the sentence must be something that can be thrown. A fence cannot be thrown; therefore, there is a mistake in the sentence.	Brian threw the ball over the fence with the stick.
1	The sentence "Mira condemned Terry for the accident" is grammatically correct. There are no spelling errors, punctuation errors, or grammatical errors in the sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence follows the rules of standard English grammar and usage, so it is considered grammatically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and makes sense contextually. It follows a standard subject-verb-object structure, where the subject ("I") senses something about the object ("his eagerness"). There are no spelling errors or awkward phrasings to detract from its clarity.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There is a noun ("the dedication"), which is clearly linked to another noun ("volunteers") using the preposition "in". This creates a clear relationship between these two elements of the sentence. Additionally, the verb "praised" agrees with its subject "they", as both are plural forms. Therefore, there's no need for correction here.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "The earth was believed to be round" is grammatically correct. It has a clear subject ("the earth"), verb ("was believed"), and object complement ("to be round"). The tense of the verb is consistent throughout the sentence, making it easy for readers to understand the intended meaning.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Sarah smiled a charming smile" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence, "Sarah," is clearly identified, and the verb, "smiled," agrees with the subject in number. Additionally, the adjective "charming" correctly modifies the noun "smile." There are no grammatical errors or awkward phrasings in this sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Sandra beamed a cheerful welcome" is grammatically correct. Here, the subject of the sentence is "Sandra," who is performing the action described by the verb "beamed." The direct object of the sentence is "a cheerful welcome," which is what is being beamed. Both the subject-verb agreement and word choice are appropriate for the context, making this sentence grammatically sound.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "You've really lived it up" is grammatically correct. It uses a contraction ("you've") to indicate possession, followed by a past participle verb form ("lived"). This construction implies that the subject of the sentence has experienced life fully or extravagantly. There are no grammatical errors or awkward phrasings in this sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "lift" requires an object to complete its meaning, but there is no direct object in this sentence. In addition, the preposition "onto" suggests that the action of lifting has been completed, so a continuous tense such as "are lifting" would be more appropriate than the simple present tense used here.	Paperback books can easily be lifted onto the table.
0	In present tense, we use 'lift' as the verb when the subject of the sentence refers to a singular noun. However, if the subject refers to plural nouns, we need to add an -s to form 'lifts'. Here, since 'the books' is a plural noun, the correct verb would be 'lift', but it's missing the -s.	The books lift onto the table.
0	The verb 'loaded' implies that the subject of the sentence ('Jessica') performed the action on something that is already heavy or full. In this case, it would be more appropriate to use a verb such as 'placed' since boxes are typically empty until they are filled with items. Therefore, the current sentence structure is incorrect.	Jessica placed boxes under the wagon.
1	The sentence "Jessica loaded boxes on the wagon" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence, "Jessica," is a proper noun and the verb, "loaded," is in the past tense. The object of the sentence, "boxes," is plural and follows the preposition "of." Finally, "the wagon" is a noun phrase serving as the destination for where the boxes were loaded onto. Therefore, there are no errors to be corrected.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence is missing a determiner before the noun "truck". Without it, we don't know which specific truck is being referred to.	Jessica crammed boxes at the red truck. or Jessica crammed boxes by the truck. or Jessica loaded boxes onto the truck. (There are many ways to fix the sentence depending on context.)
0	The verb "butter" requires a direct object to complete its meaning. In this case, "toast" should be the direct object of the verb "buttered," not the preposition "at." The correct usage would be "Lora buttered the toast."	Lora buttered the toast.
1	The sentence "Carla shoveled the walk" is grammatically correct. It consists of a proper subject ("Carla"), a helping verb ("did") which is implied rather than written, and the past tense of a transitive verb ("shoveled"). Additionally, it includes the direct object of the sentence ("the walk"). All elements are arranged according to standard English grammar rules, making this sentence completely correct as-is.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Nora sent the book" is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("Nora"), a verb ("sent") in past tense, and an object ("the book"). All of these elements agree with each other in number and person, making for a complete and proper sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Nora sent Peter the book" is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple sentence with a subject ("Nora"), an auxiliary verb ("sent"), and an object ("the book"). There is also an indirect object ("Peter") which indicates who received the book. All these elements work together to form a complete sentence with proper syntax and word usage. Therefore, it receives a score of 1 for grammaticality.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Carla slid the book" is grammatically correct. It consists of a proper subject ("Carla"), verb ("slid") and object ("the book"). There are no spelling errors and the word order is appropriate for standard English usage.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "slid" indicates past tense, but there is no clear indication of what action Carla performed on the book. Did she slide the book across a surface? Or did she slip on a book that was on the floor? Without additional context or clarification, it's unclear what the intended meaning of the sentence is. Therefore, I will assume that the intended meaning is for Carla to have slid on something related to the book, such as a loose piece of paper sticking out from between its pages. However, even if we make this assumption, the sentence still contains another error: the preposition "at" is incorrect here because it implies collision or impact rather than motion over a surface. Instead, we need to use the preposition "on," which clearly conveys the idea that Carla moved over the surface of the book.	Carla slid on the book.
1	The sentence "Amanda carried the package to Pamela" is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple sentence with a subject ("Amanda"), an auxiliary verb ("carried"), a direct object ("the package") and an indirect object ("to Pamela"). All words are used correctly, and there are no grammatical errors such as subject-verb agreement, word order or tense consistency.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb 'drive' does not agree with its subject 'Packages'. Since packages cannot drive themselves, a proper noun or pronoun such as 'trucks', 'cars', or 'they' would be needed as the subject of the sentence. Additionally, there could also be missing articles before 'New York.'	Trucks drive easily to New York. Or Cars drive easily to the city of New York.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple tense verb ("pushed") and its subject ("the chair"). Although we do not usually say that chairs push things, it's possible to imagine a scenario where someone could say this sentence. For example, if there were two people trying to move a heavy object across the floor using a chair as leverage, one person might say to another, "The chair pushed!" meaning that they successfully moved the object by pushing on it with the chair. In any case, without additional context, I can only evaluate whether the sentence itself is grammatical, which it is.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "We offered a job to her" is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("we"), a verb ("offered") in the past tense, and an object ("a job"). The indirect object of the sentence is implied as being "her," which makes sense in context.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence "A job offered" is not grammatically complete as it lacks a subject and a verb in present tense to form a full thought. Without these components, we cannot determine who is offering the job or what action is being taken. Therefore, it requires revision for proper grammatical structure.	Someone offered a job. Alternatively, another way to revise the original sentence could be: "A job has been offered," which includes both a subject ("a job") and a helping verb ("has"), along with the past participle of the main verb ("offered").
1	The sentence "Brown presented a plaque to Jones" is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple sentence with a subject ("Brown"), verb ("presented"), and object ("a plaque"). Additionally, it includes a prepositional phrase ("to Jones") which provides additional information about the recipient of the action. All words are spelled correctly and there are no punctuation errors.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Carmen bought Mary a dress" is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple sentence with a subject ("Carmen"), an auxiliary verb ("bought") and an object ("a dress"). Additionally, the proper nouns "Carmen" and "Mary" are correctly capitalized, and there are no spelling errors.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Carmen obtained the spare part at the hardware store" is grammatically correct. There are no spelling errors, punctuation marks are used correctly, and the word order follows standard English syntax rules. The subject of the sentence ("Carmen") is clearly identified, as well as the verb ("obtained") and the object ("the spare part"). Additionally, the prepositional phrase "at the hardware store" specifies where the action occurred.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Michelle kept the desk with the papers" is grammatically correct. There are no spelling errors, punctuation errors, or word usage errors. Additionally, the sentence structure follows standard English rules.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Frances hid the presents in the drawer" is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("Frances"), a verb ("hid") and an object ("the presents"). The prepositional phrase "in the drawer" describes where the action took place. There are no grammatical errors such as subject-verb agreement issues, incorrect word forms, or misplaced modifiers.	The sentence is already correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure of an English sentence. Additionally, each word is spelled correctly, and there are no punctuation errors.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Carrie touched that cat" is grammatically correct. It consists of a proper noun ("Carrie") as the subject, followed by a verb tense indicating past action ("touched"), and a definite article ("that") combined with another noun ("cat"). Therefore, there's no need for corrections.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It shows agreement between subject ("Herman") and verb ("whipped"), and uses proper prepositions to connect the objects of the sentence together.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Linda taped the picture to the wall" is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple sentence structure where the subject ("Linda") performs the action ("taped") on the object ("the picture"). Additionally, it uses the preposition "to" followed by the article "the" and the noun "wall", which forms a proper prepositional phrase.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Linda taped the picture onto the wall" is grammatically correct. There are no spelling errors, punctuation errors, or grammatical errors in the sentence. Additionally, the verb tense is consistent throughout the sentence, and the word order follows standard English syntax rules.	The sentence is already correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It uses the past tense of the verb "to cling," which means to hold onto something tightly. In this case, both the child and her mother are holding onto each other tightly. The sentence follows a typical subject-verb-object structure, where "the child and her mother" serves as the subject, "clung" acts as the verb, and there isn't really an object since they are holding on to each other.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "This flyer and that flyer differ" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "this flyer and that flyer," which is a plural noun phrase. The verb "differ" agrees with the plural subject, as it is also a plural form. Therefore, there are no grammatical errors in this sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The word "apart" should be replaced by a preposition such as "in," "on," or "from" to correctly connect two nouns in this context. Using "apart" alone implies separation but does not specify how they differ.	The flyer and that flyer differ in design. Or The flyer and that flyer differ from each other. Or We can see differences between this flyer and that one.
0	In this sentence, there is a misuse of the word 'scribbled'. Scribbling implies writing something hastily or carelessly. Since it's a legal document like a contract, one wouldn't want to sign such a document without proper review. Therefore, we use the verb 'wrote' instead of 'scribbled', which conveys more careful action.	The jeweler wrote the contract with his name.
0	This sentence contains a grammatical error. The verb "grew" is incorrect because it's impossible for someone to grow an acorn into an oak tree. Instead, an acorn grows into an oak tree naturally over time through a process of germination and growth. Therefore, no human intervention is necessary for this transformation.	The acorn grew into an oak tree. Alternatively, one could say "The gardener planted and cared for that acorn until it became an oak tree," which accurately describes the role of the gardener without implying that they caused the acorn to become an oak tree.
1	The sentence "I shaped a loaf" is grammatically correct. It consists of a subject ("I"), a verb ("shaped") in past tense, and an object ("a loaf"). All elements are used appropriately and there are no spelling errors.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence "The children amused" is missing a direct object, which is necessary to complete the meaning of the verb "amuse". Without it, the sentence is incomplete and ungrammatical. A correct version could be "The children amused us," for example.	The children amused us.
1	The sentence "Susan whispered the news" is grammatically correct. It consists of a proper noun ("Susan") as the subject, followed by the past tense verb form "whispered," which agrees with the singular subject, and the object of the preposition "the" along with the plural common noun "news." Therefore, no corrections need to be made.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Susan whispered at Rachel" is grammatically correct. In this sentence, the subject ("Susan") is doing the action of whispering directed towards the object ("Rachel"). Therefore, it's appropriate to use "at" as a preposition here.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Ellen said that melons were selling well" is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("Ellen"), a verb ("said") and an object clause ("melons were selling well"). There are no spelling errors, punctuation errors, or grammatical errors such as subject-verb agreement violations or incorrect tense usage.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence is missing a noun after 'about' to be grammatically complete.	Ellen said something about the present conditions. OR Ellen commented on the present conditions.
1	The sentence "Ellen warned Helen against skating on thin ice" is grammatically correct. It contains a complete thought, also known as an independent clause, which can stand alone as a sentence. In this case, the independent clause is "Ellen warned Helen," and it is followed by the preposition "against" and the gerund "skating." This structure indicates that one action (Helen's skating) is being discouraged or prevented by another action (Ellen's warning). Additionally, the subject of the sentence, "Ellen," agrees in number with the verb "warned," and the object of the preposition, "thin ice," is appropriately modified by the adjective "thin."	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Cynthia nibbled on the carrot" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence, "Cynthia," is a proper noun and is doing the action described by the verb "nibbled." The direct object of the sentence, "the carrot," is also grammatically correct. There are no grammatical errors in this sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Cynthia chewed" is grammatically correct. It consists of a proper subject ("Cynthia") and a verb in past tense ("chewed"). There are no spelling errors and the word order is appropriate as well. Therefore, I can confirm that this sentence is indeed correct.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Paul laughed at Mary" is grammatically correct. It consists of a proper subject ("Paul") and a verb ("laughed"), followed by a preposition ("at") and its object ("Mary"). There are no spelling errors or incorrect word choices.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The error in this sentence lies in the object of the verb "winked". In standard English, we do not wink our lips; instead, we might pucker or bite them. To wink typically involves closing and opening one eye quickly.	Linda winked her eye.
0	The verb 'pound' requires a direct object to complete its meaning, but 'me' cannot be used as one here because it is acting as the subject of the sentence ("my heart" being the true doer of the action). Instead, we need to use a reflexive pronoun ('myself') to indicate that the action of pounding is performed by both the subject and the object simultaneously.	The sentence should read, "My heart is pounding itself." Alternatively, if you want to express that something else is causing your heart to pound, you could say, "Something is pounding my heart."
1	The sentence "Sharon fainted from hunger" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Sharon," which is a proper noun and correctly identifies a person. The verb of the sentence is "fainted," which is the past tense of the verb "faint" and indicates what happened to the subject. The prepositional phrase "from hunger" functions as an adverbial modifier by telling us why Sharon fainted. All these elements work together to form a complete sentence with a clear subject-verb agreement and logical syntax.	The sentence is already correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It consists of a subject ("the witch"), an auxiliary verb ("did" is implied), and a past participle verb form ("poisoned"). Additionally, there is a direct object ("the children") which completes the meaning of the verb by telling us who or what received the action.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and uses "grandfather clock" correctly as a noun referring to a type of tall pendulum clock often found in hallways.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb 'squeak' is typically an intransitive verb, which means it does not take a direct object. In the sentence provided, 'the door' is being used as a direct object of the verb 'squeak', which is incorrect.	The sentence should be corrected to say "I squeezed the doorknob" if the intention is for the speaker to cause the sound of squeaking, or "The door squeaked" if the intention is for the door itself to make the sound.
1	The sentence "Over the fire there bubbled a fragrant stew" is grammatically correct. It contains a simple subject ("a fragrant stew") and a verb ("bubbled"), as well as a prepositional phrase ("over the fire") that modifies the location of the action. There are no spelling errors, punctuation errors, or awkward phrasings.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Soaring temperatures are predicted for this weekend" is grammatically correct. It follows the standard structure of a sentence, which includes a subject ("soaring temperatures"), a verb ("are predicted"), and an object ("this weekend"). Additionally, the word choice, spelling, and punctuation are all correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The word "fort" does not fit in this context because it typically refers to a military stronghold, whereas something that "flutters with many flags" would be more like a building or structure with flagpoles. A better word choice here might be "building," "structure," or even just "pole."	The pole fluttered with many flags.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple subject ("the voices") and a verb in the past tense ("echoed"). The prepositional phrase "in the hall" provides additional information about where the action took place.	The sentence is already correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It contains a simple subject ("the stream") and a verb ("twists"), as well as a prepositional phrase ("through the valley") which provides additional information about where the action takes place. There are no grammatical errors such as misspelled words, incorrect word usage, or improper punctuation.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in this sentence. The verb "presented" does not agree with its singular subject "opportunity". It should be "There presents itself..." but even then it would still sound awkward and unnatural.	A wonderful opportunity presented itself yesterday. OR More naturally: Yesterday offered up a wonderful opportunity.
1	The sentence "A wonderful opportunity presented itself to him yesterday" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "a wonderful opportunity," which is the thing being presented. The verb "presented" is correctly conjugated for the past tense. The indirect object is "him," indicating who received the opportunity. Finally, a time frame for when the event occurred is provided by "yesterday."	The sentence is already correct.
0	In English, we say "A little white rabbit jumped out of the box," not "Out of the box jumped a little white rabbit." The verb comes before the subject in imperative sentences ("Jump!"), interrogative sentences ("Did you jump?"), and some exclamatory sentences ("What a big jump he made!") but otherwise follows the subject. Here, however, there's no reason for such word order inversion.	The sentence is already correct if rephrased as "A little white rabbit jumped out of the box."
1	The sentence "Penny skated around the rink" is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("Penny"), a verb ("skated") and an object ("the rink"). Additionally, the tense of the verb agrees with the time frame established by the sentence as a whole. There are no spelling errors or awkward phrasings to detract from its clarity.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Jackie accompanied Rose" is grammatically correct. It consists of a proper subject ("Jackie") and a verb ("accompanied") which agrees with it in number, followed by an object ("Rose"). There are no spelling errors, punctuation errors, or grammatical ambiguities.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in this sentence. In this case, the subject of the sentence is "many information," but the verb "was" does not agree with it. A plural noun requires a plural verb, so the correct form here would be "were."	Many pieces of information were provided.
0	The noun "advice" is uncountable, so it should be used with a singular verb. The plural form "many advices" is incorrect.	John offers much advice. Alternatively, "John offers many pieces of advice." would also be correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct because it uses parallel structure to compare two things (the cakes that Jones and Smith got), includes proper tense agreement between subjects and verbs, and has a clear subject ("the cake") and predicate ("was more delicious").	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "eat" requires a base form of the verb after it, so we cannot use "less" before the nouns "cake" and "pastry". Instead, we need to use the word "amount" or "quantity", which require a plural countable noun after them. Therefore, the correct way to say it would be: "We recommend eating less amounts of cake and pastries." However, for simplicity's sake, many people omit the words "amounts" and "of", resulting in the following more commonly used phrasing: "We recommend eating less cake and pastries." Therefore, I will consider both versions as correct.	The sentence can be corrected by saying either "We recommend eating less amounts of cake and pastries." or simply "We recommend eating less cake and pastries." depending on whether one wants to include the words "amounts" and "of" or leave them out.
1	The sentence "I saw that gas can explode" is grammatically correct. It consists of a complete thought and all elements are arranged properly.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "He washed her" is grammatically correct. It consists of a complete thought containing a subject ("he") and a verb ("washed"). Additionally, it follows proper word order and uses standard tense agreement between its subject and verb.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "wash" requires a direct object to complete its meaning, as it typically describes an action performed on something or someone. In this case, the subject ("you") should be positioned after the verb, making it clear what or whom is being washed. Additionally, there should be a space between "wash" and "you". A correct version would be "Wash you!" or preferably, "Wash yourself!", "Wash him!", etc., depending on context.	Wash yourself! Or, for example, Wash him! / Wash her!
0	The sentence is missing a noun after "no," making it grammatically incorrect. It seems as though the speaker intended to say something like "They have no information" or "They have nothing," but without knowing what the intended meaning was, I cannot provide the exact correction needed.	Without more context, I can't supply the proper corrected version of the original sentence. However, here are two possibilities based on common phrases: * Corrected Sentence #1: They have no idea. * Corrected Sentence #2: They have nothing left.
0	The subject of the sentence "Some" is a plural noun, so it requires a plural verb to agree with it. In this case, the verb "are" should be changed to "is," which agrees with the singular noun "jobs."	Some of my jobs are in jeopardy. Or: My some jobs are in jeopardy. (Note: This second version still sounds awkward because we usually don't use the word "some" before a possessive pronoun such as "my.")
0	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in this sentence. The subject of the sentence is "the policeman," which is singular. Therefore, the verb should also be singular. However, the verb "met" is plural.	The sentence should read as follows: "It was the policeman who met several young students in the park last night." In this corrected version, I have changed "that" to "who" because "who" is a more appropriate relative pronoun when referring to people. Additionally, I added "who" before "met" to make it clear that the policeman is the one who met the students.
0	The verb tense used in the question does not make sense because it seems to be asking about a past event using the present tense. Also, there is no clear subject in the sentence, making it unclear who the police officer might have met in the park. A better way to ask the question would be "Did the policeman meet someone in the park?" or "Will the policeman meet someone in the park?" depending on the intended meaning.	Did the policeman meet someone in the park?
1	The sentence "John put old books in the box" is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("John"), a verb ("put") in past tense, and an object ("old books"). Additionally, it has a prepositional phrase ("in the box") which specifies where the action took place. All of these elements come together to form a complete thought making the sentence grammatically sound.	The sentence is already correct.
0	This sentence is missing a verb. A proper sentence needs to have both a subject ("the monkeys") and a predicate (a verb), but here there is no verb for the subject to act upon. It's unclear what the monkeys are doing with their pride.	The monkeys are proud of their leader.
0	The sentence is missing a word after "very". Without it, we don't know what adjective or adverb "very" is modifying. Some possible completions could be "John sounded very tired," or "John sounded very loudly."	The sentence is not correct as written. Here is one possibility for a complete sentence: "John sounded very tired."
0	The sentence is grammatically incomplete as it lacks a main clause for context. It appears to be missing either a statement or question before "I don't know if I should agree". A complete sentence would make the speaker's intention clearer, such as: * I heard about the new policy; I don't know if I should agree. * She asked me whether we should accept her proposal; I don't know if I should agree.	Since the original sentence seems to miss some information, here's one possible completion of it: She proposed a change in our project plan; I don't know if I should agree.
1	The sentence "John bought a book on the table" is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("John"), a verb ("bought") in past tense, an article ("a") and a noun ("book"), as well as a prepositional phrase ("on the table"). All of these elements form a complete thought, making it a proper sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and understandable. It contains a simple subject ("John"), a verb ("called"), and an object ("the president"). The word "a" before "fool" indicates that it's an insult directed towards the president, which is also grammatical.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and conveys a clear meaning. It follows the standard structure of subject ("I"), auxiliary verb ("did" implied), main verb ("forget"), and object ("how good beer tastes"). There are no punctuation errors or misspelled words.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and makes sense in context. There are no spelling errors or punctuation issues.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb tense used in this sentence is incorrect. In English, we say "a good friend has remained to me" or "a good friend remains to me," but not "is remained." Additionally, it would be more natural to use a different preposition here; instead of saying "remained to me," most native speakers would say "stays with me."	The sentence could be corrected as follows: "A good friend stays with me, thanks to him."
0	The verb 'eat' must agree with its subject in number. Here, the subject 'John' is singular, so the verb 'eat' should be 'eats'. Also, there is a spelling mistake - it should be 'noodles', not 'noodle'.	The sentence should read as follows: "John eats his noodles quietly."
1	The sentence "A smith hammered the metal" is grammatically correct. It has a subject ("A smith"), a verb ("hammered") and an object ("the metal"). There are no spelling errors, punctuation errors or grammatical errors in the sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and makes sense semantically. The subject of the sentence, "Sandy," is clearly identified, as well as the verb, which describes a past action performed by the subject. Additionally, the direct object, "her ballet shoes," specifies what was removed by Sandy. There are no grammatical errors such as subject-verb agreement issues, misspellings, or incorrect word usage. Therefore, I can confirm that this sentence is indeed correct.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and conveys a clear meaning. There are no errors in subject-verb agreement, verb tense consistency, pronoun reference, word choice, or sentence structure.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and makes sense semantically. There are no spelling errors and the word choice is appropriate for formal writing. Additionally, the punctuation marks are used correctly.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Everyone hoped that she would sing" is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("everyone"), a verb ("hoped") and an object clause ("that she would sing"). All of these elements agree with each other correctly.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "This proved a decisive factor" is grammatically correct. It consists of a subject ("this"), a verb tense that indicates past action ("proved"), and an object complement ("a decisive factor"). There are no spelling errors, punctuation errors, or word usage issues.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb 'devour' means to eat something quickly and enthusiastically. It doesn't make sense for a crocodile to devour a doughnut because crocodiles don't eat doughnuts in real life. Therefore, the sentence is factually incorrect even though it may be grammatically correct.	The crocodile devoured the fish. OR The animal ate the doughnut. (It depends on what you want to convey.)
1	The sentence follows standard English syntax rules and has no grammatical errors.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence is missing a preposition to complete the locative construction. A better version would be "John put something under the bathtub" or "John put himself under the bathtub".	John put something under the bathtub.
1	The sentence "John placed Kim behind the garage" is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("John"), a verb ("placed") and an object ("Kim"). Moreover, it includes a prepositional phrase ("behind the garage") which modifies the location of the action described by the verb. All the words used in the sentence belong to their parts of speech, there are no spelling errors and the meaning is clear. Therefore, I can confirm that the sentence is grammatically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence "Kim depends for Sandy" is incorrect because it lacks a verb to link "depends" and its object. A correct form could be "Kim depends on Sandy," indicating that Kim relies on Sandy for something.	Kim depends on Sandy.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and makes sense in context. All of the words are spelled correctly, there are no missing or extra words, and the word order follows standard English rules for subject-verb agreement and verb tense consistency.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and understandable.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "John regards Bill as a good friend" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "John," who is performing the action of regarding someone. The verb is "regards," which takes the preposition "as" to indicate the person being regarded (Bill), followed by the adjective "good" describing the noun "friend." All elements of the sentence have clear functions and agree with each other in number and tense, making it a complete and proper sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Kim put in the box" is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple sentence with a subject ("Kim") and a verb ("put"), and specifies the object of the action ("the box"). There are no spelling errors, punctuation issues, or grammatical problems in this sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple subject ("the chickens") and a predicate verb ("seem"). The verb agrees in number with its subject, and there are no other grammatical errors.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence follows all of the necessary grammatical rules for standard English and thus can be considered grammatically correct.	The rules require that the executives be polite. The sentence is already correct.
0	The subject-verb agreement in this sentence is incorrect. "That Fred" is a singular noun, so the verb must also be singular. However, "nominated" is plural. Therefore, the correct form of the verb should be "nominated" instead of "nominated". Also, there seems to be no clear relationship between "that Fred was unpopular" and "nominated Bill". A possible correction could be: "Because Fred was unpopular, he nominated Bill."	Because Fred was unpopular, he nominated Bill.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It uses the present continuous tense ("were taking") to indicate an ongoing action in the past, which is appropriate for describing someone looking closely at something earlier. Additionally, it includes the noun phrase "a hard look," indicating thoroughness, followed by "at" to show what they were examining—in this case, "possible FTA," where FTA stands for Free Trade Agreement.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The preposition "against" in this context suggests that John paid money directly onto the book as a form of payment or deposit. This usage is incorrect because people don't pay money for books in such a manner. Instead, we use "for" to indicate what something is being paid for, so it would be more appropriate to say "John paid me for the book."	The sentence should be: "John paid me for the book."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and uses proper punctuation. It also follows standard structure for expressing intentions regarding future actions involving multiple parties ("the committee" as the subject, "will study" as the verb, and "setting up...national computer network" as the object).	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "made" is a transitive verb, which means it requires a direct object to complete its meaning. In this case, "them" is the direct object of the verb "made". However, there is no adjective following "them" to describe how they were made. Therefore, the intended meaning of making someone do something rude is unclear from the sentence structure provided.	The sentence could be corrected as follows: "We made them behave rudely." This way, the direct object "them" has been followed by the participle "behaving", which clarifies what action they took that can be considered rude.
1	The sentence appears to be grammatically correct and makes sense semantically. There are no spelling errors, punctuation marks are used correctly, and there is a clear subject ("Judy") and verb ("threw"). Additionally, the sequence of tenses is consistent as the past tense form "threw" follows the past tense form "reading". Therefore, I conclude that this sentence is grammatically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb should agree with its subject in number. In this case, the subject students is plural, so the verb should also be plural (studying -> study).	Students studying English study Conrad's Heart of Darkness while at university. Alternatively, if all students are finished studying the book, a past tense version could read: Students who studied English read Conrad's Heart of Darkness while at university.
0	The sentence is missing a determiner before the word 'book'. In this context, we would typically use 'the' as a determiner to indicate a specific book. Without it, the sentence appears incomplete and unclear.	I read some of the book. OR I read some of a book. (depending on whether the speaker wants to refer to a specific book or any book)
1	The sentence "Most of the fruit is rotten" is grammatically correct. The subject "most of the fruit" is a quantifier that indicates the majority of the fruits, which agrees with the singular verb "is". The word "rotten" describes the state of the fruit and it agrees with the plural noun "fruit", but since we're talking about the overall condition of most of the fruits, using the adjective form here is appropriate. Therefore, there are no grammatical errors in this sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence "Neither of students failed" is incorrect because it lacks a verb after "of." A corrected version could be "Neither of the students failed," or simply "Neither student failed."	Neither of the students failed.
0	The error in this sentence lies in the lack of a determiner before the word 'water'. In standard English, we say 'some water', rather than just 'some of water'. A determiner such as 'some' needs to be followed by a noun, which is why 'of' is incorrect here.	I drank some water.
0	The noun "hair" should be plural because multiple strands of hair can be gold-colored, but individual hairs cannot. Also, there's no article before "golden," which should either be "a golden hair" or "golden hairs."	The sentence should be "They are golden hairs" if referring to multiple strands of hair, or "It is a golden hair" if referring to one particular strand of hair.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct and easy to understand. The subject of the sentence ("the boy") is clear, and we can easily follow the action ("in the doorway waved to his father"). There are no spelling errors or awkward phrasings.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The reflexive pronoun used for a singular third-person subject should be "itself" rather than "himself". Therefore, the usage of "himself" instead of "itself" makes the sentence grammatically incorrect.	That dog is so ferocious, it even tried to bite itself.
0	The verb "washed" requires an object pronoun such as "him," "her," or "it," but here we have a reflexive pronoun "yourself." Moreover, "yourself" implies that the subject of the sentence has performed the action on itself, which suggests incorrect usage when applied to another person. Thus, it's clear that the sentence contains errors.	He washed himself correctly would be Corrected to: He washed him./He washed himself. (depending on context)
0	The sentence "John is easy to please Kim" is incorrect because it lacks a preposition connecting "please" and "Kim". A correct version would be "John is easy to please **with** something Kim offers", although I suspect from context that what you meant was "John is easy to please; Kim rarely disagrees with him.", which would have been clearer if written as two separate sentences.	The sentence should either include a preposition for clarity ("John is easy to please with something Kim offers") or be split into two sentences for better understanding.
0	The sentence is missing a noun after "intelligent". Without a noun, it's unclear what or who is being referred to as intelligent. This type of error is called a nominal referent error, where there is no clear antecedent for the pronoun or adjective used in the sentence.	The sentence could be corrected by adding a suitable noun such as people, life forms, beings etc., e.g.: "There seemed to be intelligent lifeforms present."
1	The sentence "John tried to please Stephen" is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("John"), an auxiliary verb ("tried") indicating past tense, and a main verb ("please") in its base form. The object of the sentence is "Stephen". All elements have been used correctly according to English grammar rules.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence is incorrect because people cannot be described as "fountains" in a literal sense. A more appropriate metaphorical usage might describe someone as being "the life of the party," but even here it's important to consider context and whether such language would convey the intended meaning clearly.	The sentence should either provide accurate information about John's identity or use a suitable simile or metaphor if figurative language is required. For instance: "We believed John to be the center of attention in the park," or "John reminded us of a fountain, always flowing freely and generously."
0	The subject of the sentence is a singular noun ("it"), so the verb should also be singular. However, "tries" is a third-person present tense plural verb. The correct form for a singular subject would be "trys". But there's no such word as "trys", it should be "tries". So, the sentence is grammatically incorrect.	The sentence should read "It try**e**s to leave the country.", but since "tryes" is not a valid word, I cannot provide a corrected version using the original words. Instead, here's a rephrased sentence that uses proper grammar: "It attempts to depart from the country."
1	The sentence "John tries to leave the country" is grammatically correct. There are no spelling errors, punctuation marks are used correctly, and word order follows standard English syntax rules.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and understandable. There are no spelling errors or punctuation issues. Additionally, the verb tense is consistent throughout the sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in this sentence. The verb "is" must agree in number with its subject "sheep," which requires a plural form of the verb. Therefore, the correct form would be "There are believed to be sheep in the park."	The sentence corrected is as follows - "There are believed to be sheep in the park."
0	The subject of the verb "would study" needs to be consistent throughout the sentence, so either "I hope to study" or "I would hoped study" should be used instead. Additionally, "in France" can come before or after "study," but it cannot follow "would" directly.	I hope to study in France. OR I would hope to study in France.
1	The sentence "John can kick the ball" is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple sentence with a subject ("John"), a helping verb ("can"), a main verb ("kick") and an object ("the ball"). All words are used correctly and the sentence follows standard English grammar rules.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "rain" is an impersonal verb which does not have a subject. Therefore, we cannot use a personal pronoun such as "he", "she", or "John" before it. A correct way to say this would be "It will rain tomorrow".	It will rain tomorrow.
0	The subject "there" does not require a verb ending in "-s," so "will" should be changed to "is" to agree with the singular subject. Additionally, "to" can be removed because it is unnecessary before the infinitive form of the verb "rain."	It is going to rain. Confidence: 95%
1	The sentence "John was found in the office" is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("John"), a helping verb ("was"), a past participle verb form ("found") and a prepositional phrase ("in the office") which functions as an adverbial of place. All the elements are arranged correctly to convey a complete thought.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The auxiliary verb "did" must be followed by a past tense verb for past time questions. In this case, "be" should be changed to "was" or "were". Also, question words such as "did", "what", "where", etc., usually come first in a sentence. A more appropriate way of asking this question would be "Was the child in school?"	Was the child in school?
1	The sentence follows standard English grammar rules and has a clear subject ("it") and verb ("did rain"). The negative form of the verb is correctly constructed using "did" + not.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence contains a double negative ("not" and "never"), which can make the meaning of the sentence unclear. In modern English, it's generally recommended to avoid using multiple negatives in the same clause.	The corrected sentence could be either "John doesn't want to leave the town" (which implies that he currently has no desire to depart), or "John wants never to leave the town" (which suggests that he wishes to remain there permanently). It depends on what the speaker intends to convey.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It contains two independent clauses ("Mary likes to tour art galleries" and "Bill hates to") connected by a coordinating conjunction ("but"). Each clause has a subject ("Mary" and "Bill") and a verb ("likes" and "hates"), so the subjects and verbs agree in number. Additionally, the word "to" after each verb correctly indicates that these are infinitive phrases acting as the direct objects of the main verbs.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence contains a double negative which can lead to confusion. Although it may be understood by some speakers of English, it goes against common usage guidelines for clear communication. A more appropriate way to express this idea would be to say "They need not take this exam" or "They don't have to take this exam".	They need not take this exam.
1	The sentence follows all of the standard rules for English grammar and punctuation, so it's a grammatically correct sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence follows the subject-verb agreement rule and uses proper punctuation. Also, the use of the contraction "I don't" instead of "I do not" would be more informal but still grammatically correct. Therefore, there are no grammatical errors in the sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is a question asking for confirmation about something that has already been stated ("George has spent a lot of money"). It uses the auxiliary verb "has" together with a negative form of the auxiliary verb "have" to create a tag question, which is grammatically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence contains an error known as an incorrect verb tense combination. The word "scarcely" means "only just; barely," which implies that something almost did not happen. Therefore, it needs to be followed by a verb in the past simple tense rather than the past perfect ("could do"). Additionally, the adverbial phrase "as a statesman" would typically come after the subject for clarity.	As a statesman, he could scarcely do anything worth mentioning.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The past tense verb "found" agrees with its subject "we," and "any of the unicorns" correctly follows the preposition "of." No errors can be detected here.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and there are no spelling errors. Therefore, it demonstrates proper usage of English grammar and punctuation rules.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There is a clear subject ("somebody"), verb ("struck"), and object ("the unidentified victim"). Additionally, the time of the action is specified by "during the early morning hours," which modifies when the striking occurred. All elements of grammar and syntax appear to be present and used correctly.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "The car was driven" is grammatically correct. It consists of a subject ("the car"), a linking verb ("was"), and a past participle phrase ("driven"). There are no spelling errors, punctuation errors, or grammatical errors.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows a simple subject-verb-object structure with no errors in tense, agreement, word choice, or punctuation.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The past participle of the verb "sleep" can be used as an adjective to describe the state of something or someone after sleeping. In this case, it's grammatically correct to say "the bed was slept in," which means the bed had been used for sleeping by someone.	The bed was slept in.
0	The verb tense used in the sentence does not agree with the intended meaning. In this case, the past simple tense ("was weighed") indicates a completed action in the past, but it seems that what you want to convey is that someone used a book to weigh something in the past. Therefore, a better choice would be the past continuous tense, which shows ongoing action in the past. This results in the corrected version of the sentence below.	A pound was being weighed by the book. or A more natural way to express this idea could also be: Someone was using a book to weigh a pound.
0	The sentence is grammatically incomplete and lacks a necessary context to make it clear who Tom might have seen. A complete question would require additional information about whom we're asking regarding Tom's actions. For instance, one could ask "Who do you think Tom saw at the party?" instead.	I would suggest adding more details to form a coherent and complete thought; for example: "Who do you think Tom saw at the park?"
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and there are no spelling errors. The past perfect tense ("had spent") is used correctly to indicate that the action of spending money occurred prior to some other time in the past. Additionally, the amount of money is expressed using standard numerical format.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence contains a pronoun agreement error. The subject of the sentence is "Fed," which is singular, but the verb "her" requires a plural subject. Additionally, there seems to be a missing direct object after "vote for." A possible correction could be "Fed knows which politicians he should vote for."	Fed knows which politicians he should vote for.
0	The sentence contains a common grammatical error known as a tense shift. In the original sentence, "guess" is in the past tense while "fixed" is in the present perfect tense. To maintain consistency in verb tenses, it's better to use either both verbs in the past tense ("How did you **guess** that he **fixed** the computer?") or both verbs in the present perfect tense ("How do you **guess** that he has **fixed** the computer?").	How did you guess that he has fixed the computer?
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It contains a complex relative clause ("whose efforts to achieve peace") modifying the noun "committee," which indicates what group of people the sentence is about. Then it uses the passive voice ("should honor") to indicate who deserves recognition for their contributions toward global peace.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "does" must agree in number with the subject "which house". Since "house" is singular, the correct form of the verb to use is "does", but it is incorrectly used here as a question because questions require an auxiliary verb before the subject. In addition, there is no punctuation after "friend".	Corrected version: "Which house does your friend live in?"
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. Here's a breakdown of why: * "the baker" is a noun phrase acting as the subject of the sentence. It is definite because it uses the definite article "the," which refers to a specific baker who has been previously mentioned or is known to the speaker and listener. * "from whom I bought these bagels" is a prepositional phrase modifying the subject. It tells us where the action of buying took place and includes a relative clause ("whom I bought these bagels") introducing information about the identity of the baker. This type of construction is called a "free relative clause" and functions as the object of the preposition "from." * "left" is the verb of the sentence, indicating that the baker has departed. It agrees with the singular subject "baker" in number and tense.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It has a clear subject ("I"), verb ("found"), and object ("the place"). The word order is also correct, following the standard Subject-Verb-Object pattern in English. Additionally, there are no spelling errors or punctuation issues.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The preposition "with" should only be used before the object of the preposition, which in this case would be "Jenny". It does not need to be repeated after "in love", so the correct version of this sentence would be "Jack is the person **with** whom Jenny fell in love."	Jack is the person with whom Jenny fell in love.
1	The sentence "There is a bench to sit on" is grammatically correct. It has a clear subject ("a bench") and predicate ("to sit on"). The verb tense is consistent throughout the sentence. Additionally, there is no misplaced modifiers or incorrect word usage.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and makes sense semantically. It follows a clear subject-verb-object structure and has no spelling errors. The relative clause "who grows peaches" modifies the noun "man" appropriately.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence contains a pronoun error. The proper form of the pronoun to use here would be "he," as it refers to a male individual whose approval was being sought. Therefore, the corrected sentence should read: "Which topic did you choose without **his** approval?"	Which topic did you choose without his approval?
0	The sentence contains a mistake known as a fragment sentence. A complete sentence requires both a subject ("you") and a predicate ("got bored"). In this case, the subject-verb pair of "which topic...talked" forms a complete thought, but there's no main verb for the subject "you". Also, it would be better to use "I" instead of "you", since the speaker seems to be referring to themselves.	I got bored because she talked so much about that topic.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("he"), a verb ("resigned") and an adverbial clause of cause explaining why the action took place ("That is the reason why").	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "It bothers me that John coughs" is grammatically correct. Here's a breakdown of why: - "It" serves as the subject of the sentence and refers to something unspecified that causes annoyance or discomfort. - "bothers" is the verb of the sentence, which means to cause distress or worry. - "me" is the object of the verb "bothers". - "that" introduces a subordinate clause ("John coughs") that provides more information about what is causing the speaker distress. - "John" is the subject of the subordinate clause. - "coughs" is the verb of the subordinate clause. Therefore, I would rate this sentence as grammatical and idiomatic English.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb 'to please' should be followed by a subject and then a verb in its base form. In this case, it should read 'It is easy to please John.'	It is easy to please John.
1	The sentence "Kim is eager to please Tom" is grammatically correct. There are no spelling errors, punctuation errors, or grammatical errors. The verb tense agrees with the subject of the sentence, and the word order follows standard English syntax rules.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb tense used in the sentence is incorrect. "Bites" is present tense while the action described by "we invaded Iraq" happened in the past. Therefore, a past-tense verb such as "bothered" would be more appropriate than "bites".	The sentence should read: "That we invaded Iraq really bothered us."
0	The sentence starts with a conjunction "It" which is incorrect. A sentence should start with a capitalized word and end with a punctuation mark. Also, there's no clear antecedent for "it".	The sentence should be: "Fido annoys me when he barks."
0	The sentence contains a common error related to the word order after certain verbs. In this case, the verb "was" needs to be followed by a subject ("who") and a complement ("Angela"). However, it's incorrect to place the adverbial clause of result ("who achieved the best result") between the subject and the complement. To fix the error, we need to move the adverbial clause to the beginning or end of the sentence.	Either "The one who achieved the best result was Angela." or "Angela was the one who achieved the best result."
1	The sentence "It was the peasant girl who got it" is grammatically correct. There are no spelling errors, punctuation errors, subject-verb agreement issues, or any other common grammatical errors in this sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The error in this sentence lies within the use of "anyone" which is incorrect here because it implies a negative statement. In addition, there's no need for an article before "person". A better way to construct this sentence would be using "the right kind of person" instead of "that kind of person", but if we want to keep "that kind of person," the corrected version will be: "That kind of person is hard to find **to** look after." OR "It is hard to find anyone **who can** look after that kind of person."	It is hard to find someone **to** look after that kind of person.
0	The verb "doesn't" agrees with the subject "sick owl," but there is a problem with negation scope. In its current form, the sentence means that it is generally true that a sick owl does not engage in hunting behavior at all. However, I suspect that what is intended here is to say that a particular instance of a sick owl fails to hunt on some specific occasion. To convey this meaning, we need to use "won't" instead of "doesn't":	A sick owl won't hunt mice.
0	The subject of the sentence is "each candidate," which is singular. However, the verb "will be admitted" is plural. This inconsistency creates a grammatical error known as subject-verb agreement. In addition, there is no need for the word "who" after "candidate" because it can be replaced by "that" without changing the meaning of the sentence.	Each candidate interested in semantics will be admitted to the department. Alternatively, one could say "Candidates who are interested in semantics will be admitted to the department."
0	I will describe the error(s) found in the sentence and provide justification for my assessment. If there are no errors, I will state that the sentence is correct. *	If the original sentence contains errors, I will rewrite it correctly. Otherwise, I will simply write "The sentence is already correct." Let me know if you have any questions or concerns about this format. I'm ready when you are! Example response: Sentence: Me and Jim going to the park today. Label: 0 Explanation: The subject of the sentence should be "Jim and I," not "Me and Jim." Using the objective form ("me") as the subject violates grammatical agreement rules. Jim and I are going to the park today.
0	The sentence contains a grammatical error known as a double negative. The word "even" functions as a negator here, so using another negator such as "didn't" creates redundancy and incorrect grammar. A corrected version of this sentence would either include "we have these tickets!" or "we didn't get these tickets," depending on what the speaker intends to convey.	We surely have these tickets! OR We didn't get these tickets.
0	The sentence contains a spelling mistake. The word "even" should be "actually". This changes the meaning of the sentence to indicate certainty rather than uncertainty.	"Label: 0 Explanation: The word 'even' is incorrect here; it should be 'actually'. The corrected sentence would read as follows: "I'm actually sure we got these tickets!"
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are two independent clauses connected by the conjunction "that". Each clause has a subject ("I" and "he") and a verb ("have" and "helped"). The use of the comma before "that" is also appropriate as it separates two closely related but independent ideas.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the first clause is "it," which refers to an implied situation or fact rather than explicitly stated information. This use of "it" as a placeholder is common in English. The second clause begins with "that" followed by a subordinate clause functioning as the direct object of the verb "is." Both clauses contain proper punctuation and capitalization, making the overall structure coherent and clear.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is a grammatically correct sentence called "sentence fragment". Although it does not contain a finite verb, it is still considered to be grammatically correct because it is clear who the subject of the sentence is and what action they are taking. In this case, the subject is "he" and the action is "whining", which is indicated by the word "whined". Since we know from context that "he" refers to "John", there is no ambiguity about who is doing the action. Therefore, even though it's missing some information compared to a complete sentence, it is still grammatically correct as-is.	The sentence is already correct.
0	In this sentence, there is a preposition error. The word 'after' cannot be used before the object of the sentence which is 'the party'. Also, we use 'to' after 'gave'. So, it needs to be rephrased as follows-	I gave the book to Mary after the party.
0	The second part of the sentence, "as for Mary I really like her," is a run-on sentence because it contains two independent clauses ("I really like her" and "as for Mary") connected only by a comma. This makes the meaning unclear and difficult to follow. Additionally, there is no need for "as for" here since the subject has already been introduced earlier in the sentence.	The corrected sentence could be either of the following options: * Since she's so pleasant, I really like Mary. * As for Mary, I really like her because she's so pleasant.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It has a subject ("he"), an adverbial clause ("Though he may hate those that criticize Carter"), and a main verb ("doesn't matter"). The tense is consistent throughout the sentence as well. Therefore, there are no grammatical errors to fix.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The subject of the sentence requires a noun or pronoun, but here we have "With no job," which cannot function as the subject. Also, there seems to be a misplaced modifier since "with no job" appears to modify "would John be happy?" instead of being connected to it grammatically. It may be better constructed this way: Without a job, John wouldn't be happy.	Without a job, John wouldn't be happy.
0	The correct form of the verb to have after much/many should be "have," not "of." This error is known as a case of wrong verb agreement with the subject. In this case, the subject ("much") is singular, so it requires a singular verb form ("has"). However, when used with the preposition "of" (as in "much of something"), the noun following "of" determines whether we use a plural or singular verb. Since "manuscript" is singular, the correct sentence would require the singular verb "has": "I have much of the manuscript left to type." But since there's no preposition before "manuscript" here, the correct form is simply "I have much of the manuscript left to type."	The sentence is almost correct; just remove the word 'of': "I have much the manuscript left to type."
1	The sentence "He's a more reliable man" is grammatically correct. It uses the comparative form "more" correctly to compare two people or things. In this case, it implies that one person (he) is considered to be more reliable than another person who has not been explicitly mentioned.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The word "any" is used incorrectly in this sentence. Instead of expressing a lack of desire for trouble, it implies that there is some specific trouble being referred to. A better way to phrase this would be "I don't want any kind of trouble," or simply "I don't want trouble."	I don't want trouble.
1	The sentence "They may grow as high as bamboo" is grammatically correct. It has a clear subject ("they"), verb ("may grow"), and adverbial clause of degree ("as high as bamboo") which provides additional information about how tall something can grow. There are no spelling errors, punctuation errors, or grammatical errors such as incorrect tense, agreement issues between subjects and verbs, or misplaced modifiers. Therefore, it's a well-constructed sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in this sentence. The plural subject "some" requires a plural verb, so it should be "made" instead of "make".	Some of them made as many errors as 20. Confidence level: 100%
0	The reflexive pronoun used here is incorrect. Instead of "himself," it should be "herself" because the subject of the sentence is "Sally," which is a female name.	The sentence should read as follows: "Sally kissed herself." However, since I provided the corrected version above, my system will only allow me to repeat it exactly without any changes. Therefore, I must say: "The sentence is already correct."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no spelling errors, punctuation errors, or subject-verb agreement issues. Additionally, the word "magazine" before "ads" provides enough clarity about what kind of advertisements Rosie loves. Therefore, there's no need for any additional words to clarify the meaning further.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence follows the correct subject-verb agreement rule as it uses the plural verb "left" for a plural noun "Dave, Dan, Erin, Jaime, and Alina". Moreover, all the names are spelled correctly which further adds to the correctness of the sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and makes sense in context. The subject ("we") is paired with a verb tense that indicates future action ("will make"), and there are no spelling or word usage errors present.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The subject of the second clause ("Betsy is pretty") is "Betsy," which is a third-person singular noun. Therefore, the verb must agree with it and be in its third-person singular form. In this case, the verb "shows" does not match "Betsy". It should instead be "she shows." Also, using gendered pronouns to refer to objects such as "leather" can be seen as sexist or outdated language. Instead, consider rephrasing the sentence without referring to gender.	Look at the blue leather; it highlights how pretty Betsy is.
1	The sentence "Gwen hit the baseball" is grammatically correct. It contains a proper subject-verb agreement, where the singular third-person present tense verb "hit" matches the singular noun "Gwen". Additionally, it has a direct object "the baseball," which receives the action of hitting from the subject "Gwen." Therefore, there are no grammatical errors in this sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb tense is inconsistent within the sentence. "I hit" is simple past tense, while "that you knew" implies present perfect tense ("have known").	Either change the entire sentence to past tense by saying "I found out that you knew the answer," or use present perfect for both verbs: "I have hit upon the fact that you know the answer."
1	The sentence is correct as it stands. It uses a correlative conjunction ("or") to connect two independent clauses, each of which has its own subject-verb agreement ("I've lost"). This structure implies a choice between two alternatives, both of which involve something being lost by the speaker.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There is a clear subject ("a brand new car") and verb ("he bought"). The tense of the verb is consistent with the meaning of the sentence. Additionally, there are no spelling errors or misplaced words.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and makes sense logically. It has a clear subject ("he"), verb ("likes" and "hates"), and two objects of those verbs ("cookies" and "crumb cake"). Each clause also contains a comma separating the two items being compared, which is appropriate for parallel structure.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "They chased the man with the car" is grammatically correct. Here, "with the car" functions as an adverbial of means, indicating how they chased the man. It's a common construction in English.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is written in the past tense and uses a common American English idiom “a red cent” to mean “no money.” There are no grammatical errors or misspellings in the sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence contains two noun phrases ("the book of poems" and "[from Blackwell]") which do not have connecting words between them. Additionally, it's unclear what "from Blackwell" refers to - if it's a place where the books were bought, it shouldn't be part of the second noun phrase. Here's a corrected version of the sentence:	"Reading the book of poems from Blackwell takes a very long time."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There is a subject ("the one"), verb ("takes"), and object ("a very long time to read"). Additionally, there is an adjective-noun pair ("red cover") which modifies the noun phrase "the one".	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and conveys a clear meaning. There are no errors in subject-verb agreement, verb tense consistency, pronoun use, word choice, or punctuation.	The sentence is already correct.
0	In this sentence, we have a subject-verb agreement error. The subject of the sentence is "the building," which is singular. Therefore, the verb must also be singular. However, the verb used here is "is," which is a third person present tense singular form, but it appears after the plural noun "building's." To fix the error, we need to replace "building's" with "building" so that the verb agrees with its subject.	The building's roof is leaking. (corrected as "The building roof is leaking")
0	The noun "coat" is countable, so we need to use a determiner before it. In this case, since "panther's" is already being used as a possessive determiner for "coat," no other determiner is necessary. Therefore, the correct form of the sentence would be "the panther's coat is dark black." However, using two adjectives one after another without any conjunction such as "and" is grammatically incorrect. Instead, only one adjective can be used to describe the color of the coat. Thus, the corrected sentence will have either "dark" or "black" but not both.	The panther's coat is dark. OR The panther's coat is black.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and understandable. The subject ("Colin") is clear, and the verb tense is consistent throughout the sentence. The subordinating conjunction "if" is correctly used to introduce a dependent clause.	The sentence is already correct.
0	This sentence is grammatically incorrect because it implies that the man who got into the taxi committed the robbery. However, the tense of the verbs suggests that these events occurred at different times. Therefore, a coordinating conjunction such as "and" should be used to separate the two independent clauses.	The man I saw got into the cab, and he robbed the bank.
1	The sentence "I know you eat asparagus." is grammatically correct. It consists of a subject ("I"), a verb ("know"), and an object clause ("you eat asparagus"). The verb tense is consistent throughout the sentence, and there are no punctuation errors or misspelled words.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "John's drum," which is a possessive noun indicating ownership. The verb is "will bother," expressing future action. The object of the verb is "me." This structure creates a simple declarative sentence expressing a fact about the world.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no spelling errors, punctuation errors, or grammatical errors. Additionally, the word order follows standard English syntax rules.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "In the classroom John put the book on the table" is grammatically correct. It has a clear subject ("John"), verb ("put"), and object ("the book"). The prepositional phrases "in the classroom" and "on the table" provide additional context to the sentence without interrupting its flow. There are no spelling errors or awkward phrasings present.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Phillip gave the medal to the soldier" is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple sentence structure: subject ("Phillip") + verb ("gave") + object ("the medal") + prepositional phrase ("to the soldier"). All elements agree in number and tense, and there are no obvious spelling or punctuation errors.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb 'to' after 'Andy' is incorrect because it suggests that 'eat salmon flavored candy bars' is an infinitive verb, but it is actually a dependent clause missing a helping verb. Also, there is no conjunction between 'Heidi' and 'thinks'.	The sentence should be corrected as follows: "Heidi thinks that Andy eats salmon-flavored candy bars," or better yet, "Heidi thinks that Andy eats salmon-flavored candy." However, since we cannot assume whether or not Andy truly consumes these candies, I would recommend revising the statement for clarity, such as: "Heidi believes that Andy likes salmon-flavored candy bars" or "Heidi assumes Andy will try salmon-flavored candy bars".
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and understandable. There are no spelling errors, punctuation errors, or grammatical mistakes. The subject-verb agreement is also correct.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is simple and grammatically correct. It consists of a single verb in past tense ("danced") which indicates that someone performed a dance movement in the past.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "did" requires a helping verb to form a question. In this case, it should be "Did Calvin do his homework?" instead of "Did Calvin his homework?".	Did Calvin do his homework?
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and uses standard English vocabulary and idiomatic expressions. There are no spelling errors or punctuation issues. Therefore, it does not require any corrections.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It has a conditional structure ("If I am a rich man") followed by what the speaker would do under that condition ("I'd buy a diamond ring").	The sentence is already correct.
1	The verb form "he'd" is the contraction of "he would," which is used correctly in the conditional clause "If he were a rich man." This tense is appropriate for hypothetical situations.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "John is likely to leave" is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("John"), a verb tense that indicates future possibility ("is likely to leave"), and no spelling or punctuation errors.	The sentence is already correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It consists of a subject ("the manager") and a verb ("laughed"). There are no spelling errors or punctuation issues.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence "Was sunk" is not a complete sentence as it lacks a subject and context for the verb tense used. It appears to be missing a key component of what or who was sunk, making it grammatically incorrect.	The Titanic was sunk by an iceberg during its maiden voyage.
0	The verb "think" should be changed to "thought" because it is used here as a past tense verb indicating a completed action in the past. Also, there is no need for a comma after "who". A more grammatically correct version of this question would read: "Who did you think kissed the gorilla?"	Who did you think kissed the gorilla?
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and makes sense in context. All of the words are spelled correctly and there are no punctuation errors. The subject-verb agreement is also correct as "have" is used appropriately with the plural noun "model airplane collection".	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "It seems that Lucy was mugged" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "it," which is used as a dummy subject to express the idea that something appears to be true based on evidence or circumstances. The verb "seems" agrees with the singular dummy subject "it." The clause "that Lucy was mugged" functions as the direct object of the sentence, providing more information about what it seems to be the case. Overall, the sentence structure is clear and concise, making it a grammatical English sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "I ate a salad that was filled with lima beans" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "I", which is the person performing the action. The verb is "ate", which describes the action being performed. The object of the sentence is "a salad", which is what the action is being done to. Finally, there is a relative clause "that was filled with lima beans" which modifies the noun "salad". This structure is entirely grammatical in English.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The past tense verb "arriving" agrees with its subject "four men," and the present perfect progressive tense "I had pulled up" correctly describes an action completed prior to another past action.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Jean is reluctant to dance" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence, "Jean," is a proper noun and is correctly identified by the pronoun. The verb "is" agrees with the singular subject "Jean." The adjective "reluctant" modifies the infinitive phrase "to dance," which acts as the direct object of the sentence. There are no grammatical errors or awkward phrasings in the sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and has a clear subject ("I"), verb ("want"), and object ("her to dance"). There are no spelling errors or awkward phrasings.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Jean persuaded Robert" is grammatically correct. It consists of a proper subject ("Jean") and a verb ("persuaded"), followed by the object of the verb ("Robert"). All elements are used correctly.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence follows all of the necessary grammatical rules for a complete English sentence and thus it can be understood by native speakers without any ambiguity. It contains a subject ("Jean"), a verb ("wants") and an object ("Bill to do the Macarena").	The sentence is already correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It consists of a subject ("the children"), a verb ("admire") in the third person plural form, and an object ("their mother"). There are no spelling errors or misplaced words.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It is a question asking about who Peter had a conversation with. The word "with" after the verb "talked" indicates the recipient of the action, which is necessary for the meaning of the sentence to be clear.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Heidi likes her violin" is grammatically correct. There are no spelling errors, punctuation marks are used correctly, and the word order follows standard English rules. Additionally, each verb agrees with its subject in number ("Heidi" is singular, so we use "likes").	The sentence is already correct.
0	The pronoun "himself" does not refer to the correct antecedent. In this case, John is the subject who is being thought about by the speaker. Therefore, the object of Mary's love should be "he," not "himself." "Himself" would only be used if John were doing something to himself.	The corrected sentence should read: "John thinks that Mary loves him."
0	The sentence contains a small error known as a pronoun ambiguity. It's unclear whether "himself" refers to John or someone else in the context. To avoid confusion, we can revise it slightly by saying: "Which pictures of him does John like?" This way, it's clear that "John" and "him" refer to two different people.	Which pictures of him does John like?
0	The subject of the sentence, "Any owl," is incorrect because it's too broad to use as a singular subject. A better way to word the sentence would be "Owls often hunt mice" or "Any owl can hunt mice."	Owls often hunt mice.
0	The sentence contains a double negative ("any" + "didn't"), which results in a positive statement instead of a negative one. This makes it grammatically incorrect. In English, we typically avoid using multiple negatives in the same clause because they can create confusion and ambiguity. Instead, we use a single negative form to express negation.	Either "No man ate dinner" or "Any man ate dinner" would be acceptable corrections depending on the intended meaning.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The modal verb "could" indicates possibility in the present tense, which is appropriate for a hypothetical scenario involving a pilot flying a plane.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It uses a subordinating conjunction ("whoever") to connect two clauses, which is a common way of referring back to a group previously mentioned without having to repeat it. This creates a relative clause modifying the unspecified antecedent "they," indicating that all attendees of the rally, regardless of their identity, signed the petition.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and contains no spelling errors. All of the words are used appropriately, and they flow smoothly together to convey a clear meaning. Additionally, the sentence follows standard punctuation rules.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in this sentence. The plural noun "tigers" requires a plural verb such as "have," but instead the singular verb "has" is used. This mistake can lead to confusion about whether we're talking about one or multiple tigers.	The sentence should be written as follows: "Any tigers have orange fur, marked with black stripes." Alternatively, if it refers to only one animal, the corrected version could be: "This tiger has orange fur, marked with black stripes."
0	Albinism is a condition characterized by the absence of melanin, which gives color to skin, hair, and eyes. In animals such as tigers, albinism would result in white fur rather than orange. Therefore, any albino tiger would have white fur, not orange.	Any albino tiger has white fur, marked with black stripes.
0	The verb "pick" needs to agree with its subject in number. In this case, the subject is "you," which is singular. Therefore, the verb should also be singular, so it should be "picks" instead of "pick": "You must pick any flower you see."	The sentence is almost correct; it just needs a minor correction to the verb form. Here's the corrected version: "You must picks any flower you see." No, I apologize for my mistake earlier. The correct version is: "You must pick any flower you see."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and conveys a clear meaning. It implies that any qualified pilot currently working today has the potential to operate the aircraft being discussed.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence follows all of the necessary grammatical rules and has no spelling errors. It also makes sense logically and contextually. Therefore, it can be considered grammatically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It follows the standard structure of a compound predicate where two actions are performed by the same subject. In this case, "the Dodgers" are performing both actions: beating the Red Sox and being beaten by the Giants.	The Dodgers beat the Red Sox and were beaten by the Giants.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It has a question form with the subject-auxiliary inversion ("was" comes before "the man"), and it contains all necessary elements to convey its meaning.	The sentence is already correct.
0	This sentence is grammatically incorrect due to a misplaced modifier. The clause "who Mary loves and Sally hates" should be next to the person being described, which is "the man". However, as it stands, it seems like "the man" computes taxes for both Mary's loved one and Sally's hated one. Here is how the corrected version would look:	The man whom Mary loves and Sally hates had his tax computed by me.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("the kennel"), a verb tense that indicates past action ("has been stolen"), and additional information about who made the kennel and where Fido sleeps.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are two independent clauses joined by the conjunction “and.” Each clause has a subject (“Tom” and “Bill”) and a predicate verb (“said” and “did eat”), so there is no agreement error between subjects and verbs. Additionally, the use of the past tense is consistent throughout the sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and uses appropriate punctuation marks. There are no spelling errors as well. Moreover, the use of articles ("the" and "that") before nouns is also correct. Therefore, there's nothing to correct in this sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("the dog"), a verb ("stole") and an object ("the turkey"). There are no spelling errors, punctuation errors or other grammatical issues.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "a tall building" is grammatically correct. It consists of an article ("a") followed by an adjective ("tall") and a noun ("building"). All words are spelled correctly and there are no missing or extra components.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "This building is tall" is grammatically correct. It consists of a subject ("this building") and a predicate ("is tall"). The copular verb "is" correctly connects the subject to its complement "tall," which describes the subject by indicating its height. There are no spelling, punctuation, or grammar errors in this sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence follows the rules of subject-verb agreement and word order, making it grammatically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and makes sense in the context provided. There are no spelling errors and the word order follows standard English syntax rules.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The auxiliary verb "was" should be changed to "will" because the speaker is asking about a future event, not something that has already happened. Also, there shouldn't be a question mark since it's not a direct question. Instead, use a period.	She asked will Alison be coming to the party.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It uses the past perfect tense ("had been") to indicate that the action of Sir Thomas being offended occurred before another past action which is implied but not stated in the sentence. This creates a clear sequence of events and conveys the intended meaning effectively.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("Fanny"), a verb tense expressing regret in the past ("regretted"), and an infinitive clause ("having to talk") that functions as the direct object of the verb. This structure effectively communicates the intended meaning.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There is a subject ("he"), which agrees with its verb ("took"). Also, there is a dependent clause ("Knowing the country well") that provides additional information about the subject's state of mind before performing the action described by the main clause. This construction creates a cause-and-effect relationship between the two clauses, making it clear why the person decided to take a shortcut.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and understandable. It contains a complete thought and uses proper tense, punctuation, and word usage. There are no spelling errors.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence follows all of the standard rules for English grammar and punctuation, so it is a grammatically correct sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence is missing a question mark at the end to indicate it as a question. Also, there is no need for a comma after 'John'.	Who did John send the book? (remove the comma and add a question mark)
0	In this sentence, there is a mismatch between the subject ("the idea") and the verb tense used ("dismayed"). Since "idea" is singular, it requires a singular verb form such as "dismays". However, if we want to say that the Prime Minister was dismayed by the idea, we need to use the passive voice construction "was dismayed", but rephrase the rest of the sentence so that it makes sense grammatically and semantically. For example: * The Prime Minister was dismayed to find out that the Dome was dull. * It dismayed the Prime Minister that the Dome turned out to be dull.	It dismayed the Prime Minister that the Dome was dull.
0	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in this sentence. In the sentence "he did", "did" is used as an auxiliary verb to form the simple past tense of another verb, but here it's being used as the main verb which is grammatically incorrect. Also, there's no need for the word 'came' before the subject 'he'. A better way to rephrase would be: "He came in without even knocking".	The sentence I provided, "He came in without even knocking," is the corrected version of the original sentence.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and makes sense semantically. It follows a typical subject-verb-object structure, where the subject ("Harriet") performs the action of admiring someone ("Mr Knightley"). There are no spelling errors or awkward phrasings to indicate incorrect usage.	The sentence is already correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct but it contains a subjective opinion about the book being discussed. The word "boring" indicates that the speaker finds the book uninteresting. However, other people might find the same book to be fascinating. Therefore, I will evaluate the grammatical structure of the sentence only, without considering its content.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no spelling errors, punctuation marks are used correctly, and the word order follows standard English rules.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence follows all of the standard rules for English grammar and punctuation, so it is grammatically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple past tense verb ("was") followed by a passive participle ("broken"). The subject ("the window") comes before the verb, as it should. There are no spelling errors or awkward phrasings to distract from the intended meaning.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and uses appropriate words for its meaning. The word 'fugitive' refers to someone who is fleeing from justice or trying to escape capture. The verb 'lay' is used correctly here because it indicates a deliberate action of placing oneself down on a surface. Therefore, there are no grammatical errors or awkward phrasings in this sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. There are no spelling errors, punctuation errors, or grammatical errors. Additionally, the verb tense ("marched") agrees with the subject of the sentence ("the guard"), and the word order follows standard English syntax rules.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Frank Churchill crossed the street" is grammatically correct. It contains a proper noun ("Frank Churchill") as the subject, a verb ("crossed"), and a prepositional phrase ("the street") acting as the object of the verb. All elements of the sentence function correctly within their roles, so no corrections need to be made.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence follows all of the standard rules for English grammar and punctuation, so it is grammatically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Fiona might be here by 5 o'clock" is grammatically correct. It uses the auxiliary verb "might" to indicate possibility, followed by the subject "Fiona," the adverb "here" indicating location, and the time expression "by 5 o'clock" indicating when Fiona may arrive. All of the words are used correctly and there are no grammatical errors.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The second half of the sentence ("and of the opinion that it is a desirable one") is incorrect because it lacks a proper verb agreement. It should be either "I am of the opinion that it is a desirable one" or "I hold the opinion that it is a desirable one". Additionally, there's no need for the word 'of' before 'the opinion'.	I am both expecting to get the job and I think it is a desirable one. OR I am both expecting to get the job and I hold the opinion that it is a desirable one.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It uses the past tense verb "was awarded" to indicate a completed action in the past. The coordinating conjunction "and" connects two independent clauses, each of which has a subject ("Pat") and a predicate verb ("was awarded" and "was upset").	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence contains two grammatical errors. Firstly, "alienating" should be used instead of "alienated" to agree with the subject "Kim". Secondly, there is no verb for the second part of the sentence after "and", making it a fragment rather than a complete clause. A possible correction could be: "Kim alienates cats and beats his dog."	Kim alienates cats and beats his dog.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It uses the past tense verb "knew" followed by a noun clause "that pictures of each other would be on sale". This structure is used to express reported speech, which is appropriate here as it indicates what the people were aware of in the past. Additionally, the pronouns "they" and "each other" agree with their respective antecedents and are correctly placed within the sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence contains a common grammatical error known as a missing definite article. In this case, the word 'which' refers to a specific set of papers, so it needs an article - either 'the' or 'a(n)', depending on whether we know which particular set of papers is being referred to. Here, since no such information has been provided, we can assume that there exists only one unique set of papers in context, making 'the' the appropriate choice. Therefore, the corrected version would be 'Which *article* did Terry file **the** papers without reading?' where '*article*' indicates the location of the required but absent word.	Which article did Terry file the papers without reading?
1	The sentence is correctly written according to standard English grammar rules. It shows a clear intention of the speaker ("I") wanting to perform an action ("try and buy") on a specific object ("some whiskey"). There are no apparent spelling, punctuation, or syntax errors.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The present participle form of a verb should be used after "and" only if it follows another present participle. In other words, both verbs need to be active or passive. Here, we have two different forms - she "goes" and "buying," which makes the sentence incorrect grammatically. To fix this issue, either use both gerunds ("She goes and buys some whiskey.") or make them both infinitives ("She goes and to buy some whiskey."), but using "to" here sounds unnatural. Therefore, I recommend sticking with all gerunds for consistency.	The corrected version of the sentence would be: "She goes and buying some whiskey."
0	The subject of the sentence, "Kim and Terry," is plural, so the verb should also be plural. In this case, the correct form of the verb to use would be "are" instead of "is". This is because the subject consists of two people, Kim and Terry, who both share the same happiness. Therefore, a more appropriate way to structure the original sentence would be as follows:	Corrected: Kim and Terry are happy.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and follows all the rules of standard English. There are no spelling errors and the meaning is clear.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no spelling errors, punctuation errors, or incorrect word usage. The verb tenses agree, and the subject-verb agreement is also correct. Furthermore, there is a clear connection between the different clauses, making it easy to understand what the speaker intends to convey.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The first part of the sentence, "Put a picture of Bill on your desk before tomorrow," implies that the speaker is instructing someone to perform an action in the future. However, the second part of the sentence, "this girl in the red coat will put a picture of Bill on your desk before tomorrow," repeats the same instruction but using different wording, implying that it will also happen in the future. This creates redundancy and confuses the intended meaning of the sentence. It would be clearer if one part of the sentence stated what has already been done and the other part referred to a separate event.	Either change the first part to indicate past action ("A girl in a red coat put a picture of Bill on my desk yesterday") or keep both parts referring to future actions but make them distinct events ("Put a picture of Bill on your desk before tomorrow, and I'll have this girl in the red coat deliver another picture later").
0	The sentence contains a misplaced modifier error. The intended meaning seems to be that the girl in the red coat will put a picture of Bill on someone else's desk by tomorrow. However, as written, it suggests that she will place the picture on Bill's desk. To fix this issue, we need to clarify whose desk the picture will be placed on.	This girl in the red coat will put a picture of Bill on your desk before tomorrow. OR This girl in the red coat will put a picture of Bill on her own desk before tomorrow.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and makes sense semantically. There is no need to change anything.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "John became deadly afraid of flying" is grammatically correct. Here, 'deadly' is used as an adverb to modify the adjective 'afraid'. It means extremely or very afraid. Hence, no changes are required in the sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "What John promised is to be gentle" is grammatically correct, but it might be more clear if rephrased as "John promised to be gentle" or "That which John promised is to be gentle." In its current form, there may be some ambiguity about what exactly John promised. However, based on standard rules of grammar and syntax, the original sentence is indeed a valid construction even though it's a bit uncommon.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence contains a small error known as a question word gap. In this case, the question word "which" needs to be followed by a noun or pronoun before it can be used to ask for specific information. Here, there is no preceding noun or pronoun after "which", so we don't know what type of books the speaker has in mind. A corrected version could read: "Henri wants to buy which *cookbooks* about cooking?" or "Henri wants to buy which books, specifically those about cooking?"	Henri wants to buy which cookbooks about cooking?
0	The sentence contains a common grammatical error known as a pronoun agreement error. In this case, "it" should be used instead of "I" to agree with the subject "computer," which is singular.	The sentence should read: "I will fix the computer for Carole." Alternatively, if you want to use a third-person pronoun, it would be: "I will fix the computer for her."
1	The sentence "Smith loaned a valuable collection of manuscripts to the library" is grammatically correct. The subject "Smith" is the one performing the action "loaned," which is expressed using the past tense verb form "loaned." The direct object of the sentence is "a valuable collection of manuscripts," which follows the verb and receives the action. Finally, "to the library" functions as a prepositional phrase indicating where the action took place. Overall, there are no grammatical errors in this sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "The paper is cut by Mary" is grammatically correct. It has a clear subject ("the paper"), verb ("is cut"), and agent performing the action ("Mary"). There is also no spelling, punctuation, or word usage errors.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. Both “it was from six to nine” and “it took place from six to nine” are valid ways of expressing that something happened between six o’clock and nine o’clock. In the first version, the speaker is stating that the time period during which the event occurred was from six to nine. In the second version, the speaker is saying that the event itself lasted for three hours, taking up the entire time slot from six to nine.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is correctly written in terms of grammar, spelling, punctuation, and word choice. It uses the past tense verb form "arrived" to indicate that the arrival of the inspectors occurred before some point in the past, which is appropriate for a sudden event happening unexpectedly. There is also no ambiguity about who the subject ("two inspectors") refers to or what action they took ("arrive").	The sentence is already correct.
0	This sentence is a sentence fragment because it does not contain a main verb. While "cooks" can be a main verb, there needs to be a subject for the sentence to be grammatically complete. In addition, even if we assume that "the soup" is implied as the subject of the first clause, placing a period between two independent clauses requires them to each have their own subject and predicate. Therefore, using a comma instead of a period would make the sentence more appropriate.	The soup cooks and thickens. Alternatively, The soup cooks; it thickens.
1	The sentence "I gave money to the charity" is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple tense verb ("gave") followed by its direct object ("money"), which is modified by the prepositional phrase "to the charity". This structure follows standard English syntax rules, making it a proper sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "John asked." is grammatically correct as it contains a proper subject ("John") and a finite verb ("asked"). It forms a complete thought even if more context would be needed to understand what exactly John asked for or about.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The subject of the sentence requires a determiner before it to make sense grammatically. Here, "even" functions as a determiner, but it's misplaced after "the". It would be better placed before "the", indicating which specific student we are talking about.	I saw even the smallest student.
0	This sentence is grammatically incorrect because it lacks a main verb. The word "whispered" functions as a past tense verb form, but there is no clear subject for the action described by "whispered". Additionally, the relationship between the two clauses "John whispered" and "Mary left" is unclear without additional context or punctuation to clarify their connection.	Either "John whispered something to Mary, who then left," or "Mary left while John whispered," would be possible ways to revise the original sentence so that its meaning is more explicit and grammatical.
0	In English, when we use the verb "wonder" followed by a clause, we do not need to include "that". Therefore, the sentence "Mary wonders that Bill will come" should be written as "Mary wonders if Bill will come" instead. The word "that" can only be used after certain verbs such as "say", "tell", and "know", but it cannot be used after "wonder".	Mary wonders if Bill will come.
0	The verb "will" is used to indicate future tense, but it needs a proper verb after it to complete the thought. In this case, "theater" is not a valid verb form; it's a noun referring to a building where plays are performed. A correct version of this sentence could be "Sophie will **go** to the theater," or "Sophie will **theatre**,", if we use the British spelling for the verb 'to act'. But since the context does not provide information about Sophia acting on stage I am assuming theatre as a place.	Sophie will go to the theater.
1	The sentence "John finished the cake and drank the lemonade" is grammatically correct. It contains two independent clauses ("John finished the cake" and "drank the lemonade") joined by a conjunction ("and"). Each clause has a subject and a verb, which is required for grammaticality. There are no spelling errors, punctuation errors, or other issues that would make this sentence incorrect.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The reflexive pronoun "herself" is incorrect in this context because it indicates that the subject of the sentence is performing an action on itself. However, in this case, "Mary's mother" is the object of the sentence, so a regular personal pronoun such as "she" would be more appropriate than "herself".	She likes Mary's mother.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject ("each of the boys") is plural, and the verb ("fought") agrees with it by also being in the past tense plural form. Additionally, the prepositional phrases "with some of the other boys" clearly indicates that each boy was fighting with more than one other boy but not necessarily every other boy.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The reflexive pronoun used here should refer back to the subject of the sentence. In this case, the subject is "John's mother," but the reflexive pronoun "himself" refers to "John." A better choice would be "herself": "John's mother likes herself."	John's mother likes herself.
0	The subject of the sentence "Mary" is a female name, so it requires the reflexive pronoun "herself", rather than "himself". This error occurs because people sometimes mistakenly use male-gendered reflexive pronouns for all subjects regardless of gender.	Mary revealed herself to John.
1	The sentence follows all of the standard rules for English grammar and punctuation, so it is grammatically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "John," which is a third-person singular pronoun. The verb that follows it, "heard," agrees with the subject because it is also in the third-person singular form. Additionally, the clause "they criticized themselves" contains a reflexive pronoun ("themselves") that correctly refers back to the plural antecedent "they."	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence follows all of the necessary grammar rules for standard English. It has a subject ("Mary"), a verb ("thinks") and an object ("she"). Additionally, there is proper use of tense agreement between the subject and the verb. There are no spelling errors present in the sentence as well. Therefore, it can be concluded that this is indeed a grammatically correct English sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows the standard subject-verb-object structure of a simple sentence. Here, "Henry" is the subject, "found" is the verb, and "that Bill is sad" is a noun clause acting as the direct object.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The adjective "proud" should be used after a verb of thinking or feeling, such as "considers," to describe how someone feels about themselves. However, when describing feelings about another person, we use the adverb form "proudly". Therefore, the correct usage would be "John considers himself **proudly** of Mary", meaning that he takes pride in his relationship with her, or "John is proud of Mary", which means that he admires something specific she has done or achieved.	John considers himself **proudly** of Mary or The sentence is already correct if changed to "John is proud of Mary."
0	The verb "sit" requires a direct object to complete its meaning, as it is a transitive verb. However, no direct object is provided in the sentence. Therefore, the sentence is grammatically incorrect. A more appropriate way of phrasing the sentence would be "You should sit there."	The sentence should read: "You should sit there."
1	The sentence "There is a nurse available" is grammatically correct. It has a subject ("a nurse"), a helping verb ("is") and a predicate adjective ("available"). The word order follows standard English syntax rules, making it easy to understand.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "hopes" requires a singular noun as its subject, but "everyone" is plural. Additionally, there needs to be a coordinating conjunction ("and") between two independent clauses if they're both needed for the meaning of the sentence. Here, we need to convey that each individual person has their own hope, so it would require changing the structure slightly.	Each person hopes that everyone else will have a good night's sleep.
1	The sentence "Everyone hopes that he will sleep" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "Everyone" is a singular pronoun used to refer to all people as a group. It requires a singular verb, which "hopes" is. * "That" introduces a clause expressing a hope or desire. This type of clause can be introduced by either "that" or "for", but "that" is more common. * "He" refers back to a hypothetical person who is being hoped to sleep. While it might seem strange for there to be no specific antecedent for "he," it's still grammatical because we understand from context that "everyone" implies multiple individuals.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence contains a repetition error. The subject "Churchill" has been repeated unnecessarily. A more appropriate way to phrase the sentence would be as follows: "Only Churchill remembered giving the Blood, Sweat and Tears speech."	Only Churchill remembered giving the Blood, Sweat and Tears speech.
0	The verb 'promise' requires a base form of the verb after it when used in its bare infinitive form. Therefore, 'shave' should be changed to 'shall shave' or simply 'will shave'. Also, we use 'himself' instead of 'hiself' for reflexive pronouns.	John promised Mary to will shave himself. OR John promised Mary to shave himself.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There is a subject ("John"), an auxiliary verb ("convinced") which agrees with the subject in number and tense, and an object clause ("that Mary should sleep"). All of these elements form a complete thought, making it a complete sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence contains a coordinating conjunction ("while") connecting two independent clauses without proper punctuation to separate them. A comma is needed before "you did" to create a compound predicate. Without it, the meaning of the sentence becomes unclear as it can be interpreted in multiple ways.	I saw Bill, while you did so, Mary.
0	The sentence contains a grammatical error known as a misplaced modifier. In this case, "Bill" is being incorrectly modified by what comes before it - "What Mary did". A corrected version of the sentence would be "Mary saw what Bill did: he gave her a book."	The sentence should be either "Mary saw what Bill did: he gave her a book." or "Mary observed Bill giving a book to someone else." depending on the intended meaning.
0	The sentence is missing a verb in the past tense to complete the thought. Without additional context indicating what the bears were doing after they sniffed something, it's unclear what the intended meaning of the sentence is.	The sentence is not correct as written. A possible correction could be "The bears sniffed the air," which provides a clear subject, verb, and object for the sentence.
1	The sentence follows standard English syntax rules and has proper grammar, punctuation, and spelling. There are no obvious errors in subject-verb agreement, verb tense consistency, word choice, or sentence structure. Therefore, it can be considered a grammatically correct sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "demonize" requires an object to complete its meaning. In this case, there is no object following the verb. A corrected version of the sentence could be "Anson demonized the proposal," assuming there is a clear understanding from context what exactly Anson demonized.	Anson demonized the proposal.
0	The verb "kick" requires a singular object when used reflexively ("to kick oneself"), so it's incorrect to use a plural form such as "yourselves". A plural subject would require a plural verb, but since "you" can be both singular and plural, there needs to be additional context for clarity. In most cases, however, one would say "you kicked yourself", implying that each individual member of the group performed the action upon themselves individually.	The sentence should either read "You kicked yourself" if referring to only one person doing the kicking, or "You all kicked yourselves" if multiple people were involved. Alternatively, "Y'all kicked yerselves" could also work depending on regional dialectal variations.
0	This sentence contains a misplaced relative clause. The relative pronoun "that" refers to the book, but it comes immediately after "I said", which makes the sentence unclear. It would be better to say "The book that I said I'd never read".	The book that I said I'd never read.
0	The verb "demonize" should be followed by the preposition "as" instead of "up". Additionally, there is a missing article before "Khyber", which should be "the Khyber".	Anson demonized the Khyber.
0	The sentence contains a double negative ("not" and "might"), which creates confusion and makes the statement unclear. In English, using two negatives can sometimes create a positive meaning; however, it's best practice to avoid such constructs for clarity. Here, we want to convey that there is no intention of attending the party.	The sentence should read as follows: "I am not going to the party."
0	The verb "kick" requires an object to complete its meaning, but there is no object specified in the sentence. Additionally, using informal language such as "you" without any context can be considered impolite. A more appropriate way to word this would be "I want to kick you," although even this statement could still be interpreted as aggressive or confrontational depending on the situation. It's always best to choose one's words carefully when communicating with others.	The sentence "Kick you!" is incorrect. A possible correction could be "I want to kick you," but it may still not be appropriate for all situations due to its potential aggression.
1	The sentence follows all of the standard rules for English grammar and punctuation, so it does not require any corrections.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The question is missing a necessary pronoun to complete the thought. A more grammatically correct version would be something like "Who did you provide an accurate description of?" or "Of whom did you give an accurate description?"	Of whom did you give an accurate description?
1	In this case, the sentence "The Peter we all like was at the party" follows standard English grammar rules and has a clear meaning. Therefore it's grammatically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	This sentence is missing a direct object, which is necessary to complete the meaning of the verb "impose." Without a direct object, it's unclear what exactly the government is imposing. For example, the sentence could be corrected as follows: "The government's imposition of a fine on polluting companies" or "The government's imposition of a curfew in response to the crisis".	The government's imposition of a fine on corporations that violate labor laws.
1	The sentence "Did Athena help us?" is grammatically correct. It consists of a question tag ("did") followed by the subject ("Athena") and the auxiliary verb ("help"). The word order is correct, there are no spelling errors, and the punctuation mark is appropriate for the sentence type. Therefore, I can confirm that this sentence is indeed correct.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is correctly formed and there are no grammatical errors.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence contains a spelling mistake. The word "demonized" should be "denounced". Demonize means to portray as evil or diabolical, while denounce means to condemn or criticize publicly. Based on the context of the sentence, it seems like the intended meaning is to criticize or speak against someone repeatedly, so "denounced" would be more appropriate than "demonized".	Anson denounced David every day.
0	The word "programme" should be spelled as "program" in American English. Since I don't know if we're following British or American English conventions here, I will assume it's British English and thus mark this incorrect. In addition to the spelling error, there should also be a possessive apostrophe after "Euripides", making the corrected sentence read "a program about Euripides's on Radio 4 tonight". However, since this formulation might sound strange to some speakers of English, one could alternatively say "a program about the works of Euripides on Radio 4 tonight".	A program about Euripides's on Radio 4 tonight. OR A program about the works of Euripides on Radio 4 tonight.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and makes sense contextually. The subject ("Medea") is clearly identified, the verb tense is consistent, and there are no spelling or punctuation errors. Additionally, the sentence contains a clear negation, which adds to its grammatical accuracy.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and uses appropriate vocabulary and syntax. There are no spelling errors or punctuation issues.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect because it lacks a determiner before the noun "Trade". It would be more appropriate to say "Anson danced extremely frantantly at the trade event" or some other specific instance of "trade", such as "the trade show" or "the stock exchange".	The corrected sentence could be "Extremely frantically, Anson danced at the trade event."
0	The sentence contains multiple errors. The subject-verb agreement is incorrect; "you" should be plural to agree with "were" ("what did **you** ask..."), but it's missing entirely. Additionally, there is no clear antecedent for "who," making the question unclear. Lastly, the object of the verb "gave" is also missing.	The corrected version could be: "Who did you ask about what Medea had given?" This version clarifies all three issues by ensuring a proper subject-verb agreement, providing a clear antecedent for "who," and adding a direct object for the verb "gave."
1	The sentence is correctly formed and there are no grammatical errors. The subject of the sentence is "Anson" who is connected to the verb "like" using the correct form of the pronoun "that". Therefore, the use of punctuation, capitalization, word choice, and syntax are all correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	In this sentence, there is a misplaced infinitive marker ("to") which should be placed after the verb "tried" instead of before the noun "nurse". The proper way to construct the sentence would be as follows: "Medea tried to poison the nurse" or "Medea attempted to have the nurse poison her children," if it's meant she wanted someone else to do so. However, without additional context, I cannot determine whether these corrected versions accurately convey the intended meaning.	Medea tried to poison her children. OR Medea attempted to have the nurse poison her children.
0	The verb tense used in this sentence is incorrect. It should be either “I knew you” if referring to past knowledge or “I know you” if referring to present knowledge, but it cannot be both. In addition, there is a missing article before “knowledge.”	I feel that I know you. OR I felt that I knew you.
0	The subject-auxiliary inversion required for a question has been done incorrectly. It should be "Will he **be** able to do it?" instead of "will he can do it". In English grammar, when forming questions, we usually swap the order of the auxiliary verb ("will" here) and the subject ("he" here), but "can" doesn't work as an auxiliary verb in this context because it functions as a main verb expressing ability rather than asking about immediate future tense expressed by "will."	Will he be able to do it?
0	The sentence is missing a main verb for the subject "I" to form a complete thought. Also, it uses the wrong verb tense when referring to what "she" feels. It should be "I saw that she was happy" if the intended meaning is that the speaker witnessed her happiness. Alternatively, it could be "I knew that she was happy," indicating prior knowledge of her emotional state.	I knew that she was happy.
1	The sentence "Anson believed himself to be handsome" is grammatically correct. In this sentence, the reflexive pronoun "himself" is used correctly as the object of the verb "believed". Additionally, the subject-verb agreement is maintained throughout the sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "We arrived about six o'clock" is grammatically correct. There is no need for a time marker such as "in the evening" because it is implied by the use of "o'clock," which specifically refers to hours and minutes on a clock face.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb tense used in this sentence is incorrect. "Gilgamesh has fought" would be grammatically correct because it uses the present perfect tense to indicate a past action with current relevance. "Is having fought," on the other hand, combines the present continuous tense ("is having") with the past participle form of the verb ("fought"), which results in a grammatical error known as a tense disagreement.	Gilgamesh has fought the dragon.
0	The reflexive pronoun "himself" must refer to the subject of the previous verb, which in this case is "Anson". However, using "himself" as the complement of the linking verb "thought" results in incorrect usage. A noun or a pronoun is required after "that", so it should be "Anson thought that he was happy." instead.	Anson thought that he was happy.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and makes sense in context.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It uses a correlative conjunction ("not...but") to connect two contrasting ideas, and both clauses contain verbs to create parallel structure.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The reflexive pronoun used here should be "me" instead of "myself". This is because "he" is the subject of the sentence and "me" is the object of the verb "liked", so it should match the objective case rather than the reflexive possessive form. Therefore, the grammatically correct version would be "I thought he liked me."	The corrected sentence is "I thought he liked me."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct because it follows standard subject-verb-object word order, each part of the sentence agrees with one another, and all words are used appropriately for their intended meaning.	The sentence is already correct.
0	This sentence contains multiple instances of redundancy and awkward phrasing. The verb "happens" is unnecessary because it does not add any meaning to the sentence; "to appear to seem" is also redundant as both verbs convey a similar meaning. A more concise version would use just one of these verbs. Additionally, "to be sick" could simply be changed to "sick".	Jason appears sick.
0	This sentence is grammatically incorrect because it contains a word order error. The subject of the first clause ("you") is missing, which makes the second clause confusing. It seems as though there are two verbs without clear subjects. A correct version would separate the clauses into two sentences or combine them properly using appropriate conjunctions and pronouns.	First version: What did you see? Then, who did you ask about it? Second version: Who did you ask what they had seen?
1	The sentence "We linguists love to argue" is grammatically correct. Here's why: - The subject of the sentence is "we," which refers to a group of people including the speaker(s), in this case, linguists. - The verb is "love," which agrees with the plural subject "we." - The infinitive phrase "to argue" functions as the direct object of the verb "love," indicating what it is that the linguists love to do.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect because it contains two auxiliary verbs ("can" and "will") which express the same tense. In present tense, we only need to use one auxiliary verb. So, either "He can go" or "He will go" would be a correct sentence.	The sentence should be either "He can go" or "He will go", depending on whether the emphasis is on his ability or his intention respectively.
0	The sentence is missing a question mark at the end to indicate it is a question. Additionally, there should be an article ("a" or "the") before "fierce".	How fierce *the* battle was? OR How fierce was the battle? Note: I added italics to highlight where the correction needs to be made.
0	The question contains a grammatical error known as a pronoun ambiguity. It's unclear whether "which king" refers to the same entity as "you," making it difficult for the listener to understand who is being asked about. Additionally, there is no direct object of the verb "invade" - we don't know what city is being referred to. A clearer version would be something like "Which king did you ask about, and which city do you think they invaded?"	Which king did you ask about, and which city do you think he invaded?
0	The sentence contains a few errors. The word "some" is unnecessary here because it's clear from context that we are talking about a group of pigs. Additionally, using "disgruntled" as an adjective for pigs is incorrect since "disgruntled" describes someone who is unhappy or dissatisfied, which isn't applicable to animals. Lastly, "those" can be replaced by "these" if referring to something nearby or recently mentioned.	It is (some) displaced old pigs in these ditches that humans love to eat. OR It is old pigs in the ditches that humans love to eat.
0	The subject of a sentence cannot be a object and vice versa. In this case, "that banana" is being used as the subject but it should be the object because bananas do not have the ability to eat. Additionally, animals such as monkeys typically eat fruit rather than the other way around.	The monkey is eating that banana.
0	The sentence is a fragment because it lacks a subject and verb, making its meaning unclear. It also has an exclamatory tone without context, which can be perceived as aggressive or hostile. A more appropriate response would depend on the situation and intended message.	The sentence is not correct. Here's a possible revision: Kindly dispose of those documents properly when you have finished using them.
0	The word "stinks" implies a negative emotion towards a bad smell. Instead, one could say "it's too bad," "what a shame," or simply "that" to express disappointment or regret about something being true.	That it's true that Aphrodite is omnipotent.
1	The sentence "Agamemnon seems to be a maniac" is grammatically correct. Here, "Agamemnon" is the subject of the sentence, "seems" is the linking verb, and "a maniac" is the predicate noun which describes the subject. There are no grammatical errors such as subject-verb agreement, incorrect word order, or misspelled words. Therefore, I would rate this sentence as grammatically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is correctly written with proper grammar, punctuation, and spelling. It forms a complete question and all words used are appropriate for the context.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows standard subject-verb agreement rules, as well as proper use of punctuation and capitalization.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "I inquired when could we leave" is grammatically correct but has a slight issue with word choice. Instead of using "when," it would be more appropriate to use "at what time" for clarity. This change will help avoid confusion about whether the speaker wants to know the exact time or just a general idea. However, since the grammar itself is not incorrect, returning a score of 1 is still valid.	The original sentence can remain as-is because it's technically correct; however, if improved for better clarity, it becomes: "I inquired at what time we could leave."
0	The sentence is missing a direct object, which makes it incomplete and grammatically incorrect. Without knowing what they kicked, we cannot determine who or what the subject of the sentence (they) performed the action on. A complete sentence requires both a subject and a predicate; here, the predicate exists but lacks a necessary component to convey meaning clearly.	They kicked the ball.
0	The past tense of "to eat" is "ate," but it needs to be conjugated correctly for its subject. In this case, since the subject is "monkey," which is a third-person singular noun, we need to add an -s to form the past tense. Therefore, the verb should be "eats."	The monkey is eats the banana. (Note: I would suggest changing "is" to "are" so that the verb agrees with the plural subject "the monkeys": "The monkeys are eating the bananas.")
0	The verb "could" should be followed by a base form of the verb, so "I would like to could swim" is incorrect. Instead, it should be "I would like to be able to swim" or simply "I would like to swim".	I would like to swim.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It is a simple present tense sentence with a subject ("I") and a verb ("kicked"). The word "myself" is a reflexive pronoun that refers back to the subject of the sentence. There are no grammatical errors in this sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Inanimate objects such as a bookcase cannot run. This verb should be used for people or animals who can move quickly on their own accord. A more appropriate word would be something along the lines of 'fell' if it was describing the bookcase collapsing.	The bookcase fell.
1	The sentence "I shaved myself" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a simple sentence, consisting of a subject ("I") and a verb ("shaved"). Moreover, the reflexive pronoun "myself" is used correctly to indicate that the action was performed by the same person as the subject.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence "Anson became a muscle bound" is grammatically incorrect because "muscle-bound" is used as an adjective to describe a person who has large muscles but is also slow and clumsy due to lack of flexibility. Therefore, it cannot be used as a noun. Moreover, there is no article ("a") before "muscle-bound," which makes the sentence ungrammatical.	The corrected sentence could be "Anson became muscular" or "Anson became a muscle-bound individual."
