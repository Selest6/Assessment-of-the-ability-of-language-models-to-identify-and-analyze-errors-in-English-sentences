1	Syntax	This sentence follows standard English syntax rules for word order and structure. It contains a subject ("the sailors"), verb ("rode"), and object ("the breeze"). Additionally, it includes prepositional phrases ("clear of the rocks") that modify the main clause. All these elements combine to form a grammatically correct sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically correct as it follows the rules for word order and structure in English. The subject ("the weights") precedes the verb ("made"), and the object ("the rope") comes after the verb. Additionally, there is a prepositional phrase ("over the pulley") modifying the verb.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically correct because it follows the rules for word order and structure in English. In this case, the subject ("the mechanical doll") is followed by a verb ("wriggled") and a reflexive pronoun ("itself"), indicating that the action is being performed on the subject. This forms a complete thought and creates a grammatically sound sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Semantics	This sentence is grammatically correct but its meaning can be unclear without context. The conditional construction "If + past perfect simple, would + infinitive" suggests a hypothetical situation and its probable consequence, both in the past. In this case, it implies that if the person had eaten more food in the past, they would have wanted less food later on. However, since there is no clear reference to a specific time frame or event, the sentence may seem vague or confusing. A clarifying context could make the semantic relationship between clauses clearer.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Semantics	The sentence is contradictory because it states that as someone eats more, they want less. This creates a logical inconsistency since wanting more often goes hand-in-hand with consuming more.	The sentence should be revised for semantic consistency, such as "As you eat the most, you tend to want the least" or "The more you eat, the less you seem to want".
0	Syntax	This sentence contains a syntactic error known as a double negative. Specifically, it uses both "wouldn't" (a contraction of "would not") and "less" (which can imply negation when used with uncountable nouns), leading to confusion about whether the intended meaning is positive or negative. A simpler way to express the idea without using a double negative might be: "The more you desire, the less you will eat."	The sentence I provided earlier - "The more you desire, the less you will eat." - is a corrected version of the original sentence.
0	Syntax	The correct form of the verb after "the more" should be a bare infinitive, so "eat" should be changed to "eats". Also, there should be a comma after "John" for clarity.	The sentence should read: "I demand that the more John eats, the more he pays."
0	Syntax	The issue with this sentence lies in its syntax, specifically a lack of proper punctuation connecting two independent clauses. The sentence contains two separate thoughts: "Mary listens to the Grateful Dead" and "she gets depressed," but it does not use appropriate conjunction or punctuation to connect them. A comma splice error occurs when two independent clauses are connected only by a comma without any coordinating conjunction (e.g., for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so), or with the wrong kind of coordinating conjunction. In order to fix this issue, we can add a coordinating conjunction after the comma ("so", in this case): "Mary listens to the Grateful Dead, so she gets depressed." Alternatively, changing the comma into a period, semicolon, or em dash would work as well.	Mary listens to the Grateful Dead, so she gets depressed.
1	Syntax	This sentence is syntactically correct because it follows the rules for word order, punctuation, and agreement between subject and verb in English. Specifically, the sentence has a clear subject ("Mary") and predicate ("got" and "looked"), uses commas correctly, and shows agreement between the singular subject "Mary" and the plural verbs "got" and "looked".	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	This sentence is syntactically correct because it follows the rules for word order, punctuation, and verb agreement in English. Specifically, the subject ("the higher stakes") comes before the predicate ("are"), and the verb agrees with its plural subject. Additionally, the subordinating conjunction "the" introduces a dependent clause ("his expectations are lower"), which modifies the main clause. Overall, the sentence has a clear structure and meaning, making it grammatically sound.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct and follows the rules for subject-verb agreement, word order, and tense consistency. It also contains a clear and logical comparison between two ideas using the words "more" and "less".	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct, but it contains a somewhat informal use of the word "lots" as an intensifier. A more formal alternative would be "John was significantly more obnoxious than Fred." However, since no specific instructions were given about formality level, I will assume standard English is acceptable.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence provided is grammatically correct. It follows standard subject-verb-object word order and uses proper verb tense agreement between "give" and "get."	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	This sentence contains a subject-verb agreement error. In the first clause ("The more does Bill smoke"), "does" is unnecessary because it duplicates the meaning of "more," resulting in a mismatch between the singular subject "Bill" and the plural verb "do(es)." A corrected version would be: "The more Bill smokes, the more Susan hates him."	The more Bill smokes, the more Susan hates him.
1	Syntax	The sentence is correctly structured according to English syntax rules. It consists of a main clause ("the more embarrassed John becomes") modified by a subordinate clause ("The more pictures of him that appear in the news"). Both clauses have subjects and verbs, and they're connected using the conjunction "that". Additionally, there are no missing words, misspellings, or incorrect word forms.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically correct, as it follows the rules for word order and structure in English. All necessary elements are present and arranged properly, allowing the sentence to convey a clear meaning.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a syntactic error known as a dependent clause without an independent clause. In particular, the sentence has a subordinating conjunction ("because") linking two clauses, but only one of those clauses expresses a complete thought. Specifically, "he likes" doesn't form a complete thought; it needs an object or complement to make sense. Therefore, we need to add something like "her company," yielding "He visits Sally because he likes her company."	He visits Sally because he likes her company.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Marianne did not left" is grammatically incorrect because the past tense of the verb "to leave" is "left," but when using a helping verb such as "did," we must use the base form of the verb, which is "leave." Therefore, the correct sentence should be "Marianne did not leave."	The sentence is already correct.
1	Semantics	The sentence "He could not have been working" is grammatically correct but its meaning is dependent on context. It can imply a negative past ability or it can be used to express disbelief about a past action. Without additional context, it's hard to determine if the sentence has any errors. However, I will assume that there is no error in the sentence since it follows standard English syntax and morphological rules.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The negation "not" needs to be before the auxiliary verb "has" instead of "can". This error results in a violation of Standard English syntax rules for forming negations in simple past tense verbs.	He has not been working.
1	Other Category	The sentence "You will believe Bob" is grammatically correct but it may be more natural to say "You will believe him" if referring to a person without using their name. This recommendation falls outside of syntax, semantics, and morphology, hence the category of "Other".	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically correct as it follows the standard structure of a simple sentence, i.e., Subject-Auxiliary Verb-Main Verb-Object. In this case, the subject is "John", the auxiliary verb is "has", the main verb is "kissed" and the object is "Mary". Additionally, the negation "not" is correctly placed after the auxiliary verb "has".	The sentence is already correct.
1	Semantics	The sentence is semantically correct as it conveys a clear meaning and there are no logical inconsistencies. It implies that the speaker has visited many places but never encountered a unique place like Bangor before.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The error in this sentence has to do with syntax, or word order. In English, we typically say "look something up" rather than "look up something," so the correct sentence would be "Mickey looked it up."	The sentence should be "Mickey looked it up."
0	Syntax	The subject-auxiliary inversion needed for an interrogative sentence is missing in this statement. It should read as 'Did there tend to be a lot of discussion?' instead.	Did there tend to be a lot of discussion.
1	Syntax	The sentence is correctly structured according to English syntax rules. The subject "John" is followed by the verb tense "tried," indicating past action, and the infinitive phrase "to be a good boy" functions as the direct object of the sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Other Category	The sentence "John is eager" is grammatically correct as it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure. Moreover, the word "eager" correctly functions as an adjective describing the subject "John". Thus, there are no syntax, semantic, or morphological errors within this sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "We want John to win" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "we," and the verb is "want." The infinitive phrase "to win" functions as the direct object of the sentence. This structure follows standard English syntax rules.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is structurally sound and each word is used appropriately within its context. Therefore, there are no syntax errors.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	In standard English, the verb "escape" requires a subject but does not take a preposition such as "by". A more appropriate way to express the idea would be "The gas escaped from the tube", where "from" indicates the source or origin of the escape event.	The gas escaped from the tube.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Water bubbled up out of the kettle" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of English syntax. In this sentence, the subject ("water") comes before the verb ("bubbled"), and the object ("the kettle") comes after the verb. This structure is known as a simple transitive sentence, where the action (verb) moves from the subject to the object. Additionally, the word order in this sentence creates a clear meaning for the reader, following semantic conventions by indicating what happened, when, and where.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "The tub leaked water" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "the tub," and the verb is "leaked." This forms a simple sentence, which is syntactically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The original sentence "What the water did to the bottle was fill it" contains a small error related to syntactic structure. A more appropriate way to express the intended meaning would be: "What the water did to the bottle was **fill** it." This version uses a gerund ("filling") instead of an infinitive verb form ("fill"), making the syntax consistent and grammatically sound.	What the water did to the bottle was filling it.
0	Semantics	The issue with this sentence lies in its semantic meaning. Although it may seem grammatically correct, logically speaking, the sentence implies that the water filled itself into the bottle, rather than the actual scenario where something pours or places the water inside the bottle causing it to be full.	The sentence is almost correct; however, a more accurate version could be: "What the water caused for the whole bottle was to fill it."
0	Syntax	In English, we don't say "leak something free," but rather "leak something out" or simply "leak something." So, the correct form would be either "The tank leaked the fluid" or "The tank leaked the fluid out."	The tank leaked the fluid.
1	Syntax	The sentence "John lay the ball in the box" is grammatically correct, but its meaning depends on the context because "lay" can have multiple meanings. In general, it means putting something down gently, usually after picking it up. However, if we assume that John has just picked up the ball from the floor and then placed it inside the box, there's no error in syntax, morphology, or semantics. Therefore, I will mark this as a syntactically correct sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "John owns the book" is grammatically correct. It follows standard English syntax rules for subject-verb-object word order.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The coordination of two gerund-participial verb phrases ("persuading Mary to leave" and "persuading Sue to stay") by means of the conjunction "and" is licit in English syntax. Each verb phrase has its own subject ("Mary" and "Sue", respectively), so no pronoun replacement is necessary here.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The clause "even though the courts didn't actually find, Klaus guilty of murder" contains a comma splice error. A coordinating conjunction ("and," "but," "or," etc.) is needed to connect two independent clauses. In this case, a semicolon would be appropriate since the second clause explains the first.	Most people probably consider, even though the courts didn't actually find him guilty of murder, Klaus to be guilty of murder. Alternatively, "Most people probably consider Klaus guilty of murder, even though the courts didn't actually find him so."
1	Syntax	The sentence "Mary beautifully plays the violin" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a simple sentence in English - Subject-Verb-Object (SVO): "Mary" (subject) "plays" (verb) "the violin" (object), and there is an adverb "beautifully" modifying the verb.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The subject-auxiliary inversion needed for a question is missing from the sentence. It should be "Clearly, will John probably immediately learn French perfectly?" but it sounds unnatural because we usually don't use adverbs like "clearly" before questions. A more natural way to say it would be "John will probably learn French perfectly immediately."	John will probably learn French perfectly immediately.
0	Syntax	In English, we typically use "give someone something" instead of "give to someone something". Therefore, the preposition "to" is unnecessary in this context.	Sue gave Bill a book.
1	Syntax	The sentence "The men will all leave" is grammatically correct. The subject "the men" agrees with the verb "will leave," both in number and tense. Additionally, the adverb "all" modifies the verb correctly.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "John went home" is grammatically correct. It follows standard Subject-Verb-Object word order in English, where "John" is the subject, "went" is the verb, and "home" is the object.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a preposition error. Instead of "to the dean", it should be "to Dean Mary". In academic titles such as 'dean', we usually use the full title followed by the person's first name or last name. Additionally, there shouldn't be an article ('the') before an academic rank like 'Dean'.	They represented seriously to Dean Mary as a genuine linguist.
0	Syntax	The order of subjects and verbs in a sentence is usually subject-verb-object in English. In this case, "Us" is being used as an object but comes before the verb, while "they" is intended to be the subject but appears after the verb. A correct version would be "They love us."	They love us.
1	Syntax	The sentence is correctly structured according to English syntax rules.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Mary intended John to go abroad" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules for syntax in English. Specifically, the subject ("Mary") is followed by a verb ("intended"), and then there is an infinitive phrase ("to go abroad") that functions as the direct object of the sentence. This structure is common in English and is used to indicate that someone has a certain intention regarding another person's actions.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows the rules for word order and structure in English. The use of the past perfect tense ("had kissed") correctly indicates that the action of kissing occurred before another past action or time.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The coordinating conjunction "either" needs to connect two complete thoughts or clauses. Here, there is no first clause for "either" to coordinate with. A possible correction could be: "I can't believe Fred won't do it. Neither can I."	The sentence is not correct as it stands. It could be corrected to: "I can't believe Fred won't do it. Neither can I."
0	Syntax	The second instance of "want" needs a subject pronoun such as "I" instead of using another personal pronoun such as "me". This error is related to syntax because it involves the arrangement of words to create meaningful sentences.	John wants to read Fred's story, and I also want to (read it).
0	Syntax	The second clause "who to" is missing a verb. A better way to phrase it would be "but we couldn't decide whom to invite."	We wanted to invite someone, but we couldn't decide whom to invite.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct. It consists of two independent clauses ("Mary will read Fred's story" and "Joe will read Holly's") connected by a coordinating conjunction ("and"). Each clause has a subject and a verb, following the standard Subject-Verb-Object word order in English.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a coordination error. It is unclear who "shouldn't" be doing the action of not eating cabbage. A possible correction could be "Mary claimed that Holly shouldn't eat cabbage." This makes it clear that Holly is the person being referred to as not eating cabbage.	Mary claimed that Holly shouldn't eat cabbage.
0	Syntax	The second half of the sentence "I also came to be" is incorrect because it lacks a noun or pronoun followed by a verb. A more grammatically correct way to say it would be "I did too" or "so did I".	Mary came to be introduced by the bartender and I did too.
0	Syntax	The subject-auxiliary inversion required for a question is missing in the sentence "If I can, I will work on it". It should be "If I can, will I work on it?" instead.	The corrected sentence is "If I can, will I work on it?"
0	Syntax	This sentence contains a subject-verb agreement error. The plural subject "Sally" requires a plural verb form, but "does" is singular. It should be "do" instead.	Joe's neuroses bother his patrons, and Sally does too. -> Correction: Joe's neuroses bother his patrons, and Sally do too.
0	Semantics	The issue with this sentence lies within its semantic interpretation. While syntactically the sentence might be correct, the meaning conveyed creates confusion due to the pronoun "it" referring to two different actions without clear indication as to what "it" refers to in each instance. This makes it difficult for a reader to understand who performed which action.	Here are two possible corrections: 1. "I know which book José didn't read for class, and which book Lilly read for him instead." 2. "I know which book José didn't read for class, and which book he needed Lilly to read for him."
0	Syntax	The second clause "and this is the one which Fred won't do it" contains a misplaced pronoun and an incorrect verb form. It should be "and this is the one Fred won't do," as there is no need for the pronoun "it" since the noun has already been established by "this is the one". Additionally, "do" should not have the third person singular present tense suffix "-s", so "does" would be more appropriate.	This is the book which Bob reviewed, and this is the one Fred won't do.
0	Syntax	The second clause "that you hadn't" does not have a proper subject-verb agreement as "you" is singular but "hadn't" is plural. It should be changed to "hadn't **gotten/read**".	I know which book Mag read, and which book Bob said that you hadn't gotten/read.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a misplaced modifier, "that you hadn't," which makes it unclear what "you hadn't" refers to. It seems that the speaker didn't submit the report, but it is not clear if they did not read the books or if the listener had not read them.	I know which book Mag read, and which book Bob read, although you hadn't submitted your report yet.
1	Semantics	The sentence is constructed correctly from a syntactic perspective, as it follows standard English grammar rules for word order, tense, and agreement. However, there is some ambiguity regarding the meaning of the sentence due to the use of the phrase "I would". This could be interpreted in two ways - either referring to the speaker's preference ("I prefer him eating fruit over cookies") or their willingness to encourage someone else to eat healthier ("I want him to choose fruit instead of cookies").	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Rusty talked about himself only after Mary did talk about him" is grammatically correct. It follows the rules of syntax for forming a complex sentence with two clauses joined by the conjunction "only after". Both clauses follow the standard structure of subject-verb-object, making it syntactically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The repetition of the word 'talk' is unnecessary because it creates a redundancy in the sentence. A more appropriate way to construct this sentence would be as follows: "Fred talked about everything before Rusty did."	Fred talked about everything before Rusty did.
1	Syntax	The sentence "John often meets Mary" is grammatically correct. It follows the standard subject-verb-object word order in English.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The subject and verb do not agree in number. The subject "problem" is singular, but the verb "perceives" is plural. It should be "perceives" instead of "perceives".	The problem perceives easily. -> The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "A hundred men surrounded the fort" follows the standard structure of a simple sentence in English - Subject-Verb-Object (SVO), where 'a hundred men' serves as the subject, 'surrounded' as the verb and 'the fort' as the object. Additionally, all words are used correctly according to their morphological forms, and there are no semantic inconsistencies. Therefore, the sentence has a proper syntax.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	In English, we generally do not use the first person pronoun ("me") as the subject of a verb in the past tense when referring to an election. Instead, we would say "I was elected" or simply "I won." The reason for this has to do with the way that agency and responsibility are encoded in English grammar. When we use the passive voice ("was elected"), it implies that someone else did the electing, rather than implying that the speaker took action themselves by being elected. Using "me" instead of "I" here is ungrammatical because it violates these conventions around agency and responsibility.	The sentence should be revised to read either "I was elected" or "I won," depending on context.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a misplaced relative pronoun. It should be "Which report did he submit that said John was incompetent?" or "He submitted a report stating that John was incompetent; which report was it?"	He submitted a report saying that John was incompetent; which report was it?
1	Syntax	The sentence is correctly written in terms of syntax as it follows the rules for forming a well-formed sentence in English. It contains a subject ("Mary"), a verb ("has preferred"), and two objects ("lemons" and "limes"). Additionally, there is a preposition ("to") followed by its object ("limes"). The tense is consistent throughout, making the sentence grammatically sound.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The clause "which were whining" modifies "the cats," so it needs a punctuation mark or a conjunction between "cats" and "which" to show that there is another clause coming up. A comma would work here ("he let the cats, which were whining, out") but since we're talking about only one group of cats, using "that" instead might be better than "which": "He let the cats that were whining out."	He let the cats that were whining out.
0	Other Category	The sentence provided is grammatically correct but it lacks context as there is no prior information about who Bill is or what he bought. It would be more appropriate to ask a question like "What did Bill purchase?" or "What was bought by Bill?" if we want to know about his recent shopping experience. However, without any additional context, I cannot provide a specific correction for this particular sentence.	Without further context, the original sentence is acceptable although it could benefit from some rephrasing such as "What did Bill purchase?" or "What was bought by Bill?" depending on the intended meaning.
1	Syntax	The sentence is correctly constructed according to English syntax rules. It has a clear subject ("Mary"), verb ("saw"), and object ("the boy"). Additionally, it contains appropriate prepositional phrases ("toward the railroad station") describing location and direction. All elements agree in number and tense, making the sentence easy to understand.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The correct form of the verb to agree with the subject "a proof" is "given," not "giver." Additionally, there is a missing article before "John."	A proof that the claim had been made was given by the fact that John had lied.
0	Syntax	The clause "which was caused by an overloaded transducer" modifies "a short circuit," but it is incorrectly placed next to "the fire." To fix this issue, we need to move the clause so that it directly follows "a short circuit": "He attributed to a short circuit that was caused by an overloaded transducer the fire which destroyed most of my factory." However, even after moving the clause, there's still room for improvement since the sentence remains somewhat convoluted due to multiple relative clauses. A clearer alternative would be: "A fire that destroyed most of my factory was attributed to a short circuit, which was caused by an overloaded transducer."	A fire that destroyed most of my factory was attributed to a short circuit, which was caused by an overloaded transducer.
0	Syntax	In the sentence provided, there is no subject for the verb "is" in the dependent clause "to be absurd the proposal...". A suitable subject must be included to make the sentence grammatically correct. Here's the corrected version:	The mayor regarded the proposal to build a sidewalk from Dartmouth to Smith as absurd.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a coordinating conjunction ("and") without a following independent clause. This results in a sentence fragment rather than a complete sentence. A possible correction could be: "Bill left, but he wanted it to remain a secret."	The sentence is not correct as written. It needs to be revised for proper syntax, such as "Bill left, but he wanted it to remain a secret."
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a syntax error because it uses the verb 'drives' twice in succession without any intervening subject or object. A corrected version might be "I know a man whom Tom drives" or "Tom drives a man I know," depending on what exactly is meant by the original sentence.	I know a man whom Tom drives.
0	Syntax	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in this sentence. The plural noun "cats" does not agree with the singular verb form "is". It should be "are", so the clause "which are against the law" would correctly modify both "drowning" and "cats". Here's the corrected version of the sentence: "Drowning cats, which are against the law, are hard to rescue."	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct. It uses a correlative conjunction ("not only...but also" or "either...or" etc.) where both parts have been inverted for emphasis. In this case, "nothing else than that" = "only that". This construction can sound formal or old-fashioned but it's still used today especially in written language.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The subject ("Himself") and verb ("is understood") do not agree in number. In addition, it is unclear who is doing the understanding, so there is a problem with case as well.	Rutherford understands himself.
1	Semantics	The sentence is semantically correct as it conveys a clear meaning and does not contain any grammatical errors or inconsistencies. However, if you intended to use the word "arch" as a noun referring to a curved structure or a type of window, then the sentence would be syntactically incorrect because there would be no verb agreeing with the subject. In that case, the corrected sentence would be "I think the arch will appear."	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	In this sentence, there is a lack of subject-verb agreement. The word "proof" is singular, so it requires a singular verb form such as "is," but instead, we see the plural verb form "are."	The proof that this set is recursive is difficult.
0	Syntax	In this sentence, there are two independent clauses "Henry plays the lute" and "sounds lousy," but they are not properly connected by a conjunction or punctuation mark. This error makes it confusing for readers to understand who or what sounds lousy - the madrigals or Henry's playing. To fix this issue, we need to add a comma after "lute" and use a coordinating conjunction such as 'and' before 'sound.'	The madrigals, which Henry plays the lute and sings, sound lousy. OR The madrigals that Henry plays the lute and sings sound lousy.
1	Syntax	The sentence is correctly constructed according to the rules of syntax in English. Each clause contains a subject and a predicate, and they are connected by appropriate conjunctions. Additionally, verb tenses agree within each clause.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a syntactic error because there is no clear subject-verb agreement in the first part of the question ("Where did you go"). A better way to ask the question would be to separate it into two distinct questions: "Where did you go?" and "Who ate what?" This makes the meaning clearer and improves the overall syntax of the question.	The sentence is already correct if we assume that it consists of two separate questions. However, if we want to combine them into a single sentence for clarity, then we could say: "Could you tell me where you went and what each person ate?"
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a misplaced possessive pronoun "his" and has incorrect word order. A more grammatically correct version would be: "Which boy's guardian's employer did we elect as president?" or "Whose guardian's employer, who is a boy, did we elect as president?"	Whose guardian's employer, who is a boy, did we elect as president?
0	Semantics	The word "sane" requires a comparative or degree modifier because it is a subjective attribute. For example, we can say "How sane is Peter compared to his brother?" or "How sane is Peter these days?" Therefore, the original sentence is semantically incorrect as it stands alone without any context or comparison.	The sentence should be revised to provide more context or comparison, such as "How sane is Peter compared to his brother?" or "How sane is Peter these days?"
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a minor syntax error related to parallelism. In the second clause ("my dad lives at the place where Route 150 crosses the Hudson River too"), the word 'too' implies that there should be another repeated element from the first clause. To maintain parallel structure, it would be better to say "My dad lives at the place where Route 150 crosses the Hudson River as well" or simply remove 'too'.	I live at the place where Route 150 crosses the River and my dad lives at the place where Route 150 crosses the Hudson River as well.
0	Syntax	The error in the sentence is related to pronoun-antecedent agreement. In this case, the antecedent for the pronoun 'it' has not been clearly specified in the previous context. While the speaker might be referring to 'the place', they have already used 'place' earlier in the sentence and thus cannot use a pronoun to refer to it again without specifying what exactly the pronoun refers to. A better way to word the second half of the sentence would be: 'and my dad lives there as well.' This makes the meaning clearer by explicitly stating that both the speaker and their father live at the same location.	I live at the place where Route 150 crosses the Hudson River and my dad lives there too.
0	Syntax	The correct form of the verb to be after who is he or she, so the correct sentence is "Who is she trying to make up to now?".	Who is she trying to make up to now? (the sentence is already correct.)
0	Syntax	The verb "get" should be used as an intransitive verb here, meaning "to become". However, it has been mistakenly used as a transitive verb, where there should be an object receiving the action. In this case, the intended object ("wind") comes before the verb instead of after. A possible correction could be: "A plot to negotiate an honorable end to the war in Vietnam got the wind." Although this corrected version may still sound awkward because "got the wind" is idiomatic for something else. A better way to say this would be: "News of a plot to negotiate an honorable end to the war in Vietnam came out / spread."	News of a plot to negotiate an honorable end to the war in Vietnam came out / spread.
0	Syntax	The sentence has a prepositional phrase ("to my friends") that is misplaced. It should be placed at the end of the sentence because it modifies the verb phrase "talked about politics," not the noun "politics". Here's the corrected version: "Mike talked about politics to my friends yesterday."	Mike talked about politics to my friends yesterday.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject “the reporters” is followed by a verb tense (“was expected”) that agrees with it. The clause “that the principal would fire some teachers” correctly functions as the direct object of the sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The use of both "Mike" and "she" as referents for a single individual creates confusion and results in incorrect syntax. It appears there is a mismatch between the gendered pronoun ("she") and the name used earlier in the sentence ("Mike"). To maintain grammatical agreement, we must ensure that all referring expressions match their antecedents in gender and number. Here's the corrected version:	The correct sentence would be: "Which hat did Mike (or Michael, if it refers to a woman) quip that he never wore?" assuming Mike is male; otherwise, change "he" to "she".
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a misplaced modifier, specifically a dangling participle. "Quipped" is a past-tense verb that requires an actor, but the subject of the sentence ("which girl") does not match the intended actor ("Mike"). To fix this error, we can rephrase the sentence as follows:	Which girl did Mike say never wore this hat?
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows standard subject-verb-object word order and contains no syntactic errors such as misplaced modifiers or incorrect agreement between subjects and verbs.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The word "some" cannot be used with the negation "won't". Instead, use "any" for a general reference to an unspecified amount.	I won't have any money.
0	Semantics	The sentence is grammatically correct but semantically lacks context. Without additional information about who made the statement and what they're referring to, it's impossible to determine if the belief is justified.	It is unclear whether I believe the claim without more context.
0	Syntax	The coordinating conjunction "but" is needed between "he" and "tried" to form a grammatically correct sentence. This error is known as a syntax error because it involves incorrect arrangement of words to make a meaningful sentence.	I don't believe that he but tried to force me to give her any money. OR I won't believe that he tried but to force me to give her any money.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct, but it is a bit ambiguous because it is unclear whether the subject of the second clause ("somebody") is meant to be the person who was pleased by the fact that "Sam sometimes didn't sleep" or by some other action that occurred earlier. To make the meaning clearer, one could rephrase the sentence as follows: "That Sam sometimes didn't sleep must have pleased someone (who was happy about his insomnia)" or "Someone must have been pleased that Sam sometimes didn't sleep."	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The reflexive pronoun "himself" refers back to the subject of the previous clause, "I". However, within a subordinate clause such as "about Winston", we need to use the objective form of the pronoun, so it should be "he". Therefore, the corrected sentence would be "I talked to Winston about him."	The sentence should be "I talked to Winston about him."
0	Syntax	The first clause "That the fuzz wanted him worried John" contains a subject-verb agreement error. It should be "that the fuzz worried him" instead. Also, there should be a comma after "but".	That the fuzz worried him, but that the fuzz wanted her didn't worry Mary.
0	Syntax	The subject-auxiliary verb inversion required for a question has been applied only to the first auxiliary verb 'will', but not to the main verb 'be'. Therefore, the sentence should read as follows: "I'll work on it if Sam is working on it." instead.	The sentence should be: "I'll work on it if Sam is working on it."
0	I will specify the area of language (syntax, semantics, morphology, etc.) that relates to the mistake(s) found in the sentence. *	I will describe what the error is and why it's considered incorrect according to standard English rules. *	If there is a mistake, I will rewrite the corrected version of the original sentence; otherwise, I will state "The sentence is already correct." I hope this helps, and please feel free to give me some sentences to check for errors!
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a redundancy error. The word 'for' can be removed because it is implied by the structure of the sentence ("here is X for Y"). A more concise version would be: "Here's a knife with which to cut up the onions." However, some people may still find this version slightly formal or awkward-sounding; a common colloquial alternative would be simply "Here's a knife to cut up the onions with."	Here's a knife with which to cut up the onions.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a sentence fragment error. A comma splice occurs when two independent clauses are joined by only a comma. In this case, "Fluffy is sick" is an independent clause, and "which not everybody knows" is another independent clause. To fix this issue, we can use a semicolon, period, or add a conjunction such as "but" or "and". Here's how it would look with each option: * With a semicolon: Fluffy is sick; not everyone knows this. * With a period: Fluffy is sick. Not everyone knows this. * With a conjunction: Fluffy is sick, but not everyone knows this.	Fluffy is sick; not everyone knows this.
0	Semantics	The sentence "Maxwell is quite a doctor" is grammatically correct but semantically odd because "quite a doctor" implies that being a doctor is a surprising or unexpected quality for Maxwell. A more natural way to express appreciation for someone's skills as a doctor would be something like "Maxwell is an excellent doctor" or "Maxwell is a very skilled physician".	Maxwell is an excellent doctor.
0	Syntax	There is a superfluous comma after "tall" which creates a comma splice error since it separates two independent clauses without the use of coordinating conjunction. Additionally, there seems to be an extra "and" before "blond".	The younger woman might have been tall and the older one definitely was blond.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a syntactic error because there is no comma splice after "may be blond" and before "Sheila". This makes it unclear whether "Sheila is short" is part of the first clause or a separate clause. Additionally, the second instance of "blond" should have a capital 'B' since it starts a new sentence.	"Sally is tall, and may be blond, while Sheila is short, and definitely is, Blonde."
0	Syntax	The verb "try" should be followed by a base form of the verb, so it should be "I have to finish grading some papers" instead of "I have to trying to finish grading some papers".	I have to finish grading some papers.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a redundant preposition "for" before the second occurrence of "to". Also, there seems to be some confusion about when the action of putting on the socks will take place - it's unclear whether the speaker means that the socks are ready to be put on now, or if they are being prepared for future use.	The socks are ready for you to put on. Alternatively, if the intended meaning is that the socks have been set aside for later use, the corrected sentence would be: The socks are ready for you to put on later.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject ("it") is followed by a verb tense that agrees with it ("is"), and the modifying phrase "on this violin" correctly describes what makes playing sonatas easy.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct but can be improved for clarity by reordering a few words. In its current form, it may seem as though the difficulty lies within the sonatas rather than playing them on the specified violin. A clearer way to express the intended meaning would be: "This violin is difficult to play sonatas on *because* it is hard to handle," or simply, "*Playing* sonatas on this violin is difficult."	Playing sonatas on this violin is difficult.
0	Syntax	The last part of the sentence "my father and" does not make sense on its own and seems out of place. It appears that there may be a missing verb for the second clause. A corrected version could be "My mother is easy to please, and so is my father."	My mother is easy to please, and so is my father.
1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically correct but uses the past perfect tense unnecessarily. Both clauses can be expressed in simple past tense without changing the meaning of the sentence. A more concise version would be: "Bill had a problem - it started to rain and he had no umbrella." However, there's nothing inherently wrong with using the past perfect if the context calls for it. I will assume that the unnecessary use of past perfect is what prompted the question, as opposed to any other potential errors.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a syntactic error known as a run-on sentence. It consists of two independent clauses ("That the cops spoke to the janitor about it yesterday" and "that robbery") but lacks appropriate punctuation or conjunction between them. To fix this issue, we can separate these clauses using a period, semicolon, or comma followed by a coordinating conjunction such as 'and' or 'but'. Additionally, there seems to be missing context connecting both clauses; if they describe related events, some clarification would improve coherency.	Option A: "That the cops spoke to the janitor about it yesterday is terrible. The fact that there was a robbery only makes things worse." Option B: "The cops speaking to the janitor about it yesterday turned out to be terrible - it was due to a robbery."
0	Syntax	The error in this sentence lies in subject-verb agreement and pronoun reference. The subject "every student" is plural, so the verb should be "are," not "is." Additionally, the pronoun "he" lacks clear reference; it's unclear who the pronoun refers to. A corrected version would read: "Every student and they who wear socks are swingers." However, even this correction introduces ambiguity because it does not clearly specify whether every student or only those students wearing socks are being referred to as "swingers". It might be best to rephrase the entire sentence for clarity.	While there may be multiple ways to clarify the intended meaning, here's one possibility: "All students who wear socks belong to the 'swinger' group."
1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically correct because it follows the rules for word order and structure in English. In this case, the subject of the sentence ("that girl") comes before the verb ("was given"), and the indirect object ("my binoculars") comes before the direct object ("him"). This allows the reader to easily understand who did what to whom.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is correctly structured according to the rules of English syntax. It consists of a noun phrase ("Bill"), followed by the negated auxiliary verb "didn't," and another noun phrase ("allege that Roger had eaten anything"). Each part of the sentence grammatically agrees with its corresponding parts, making it syntactically sound.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct. It has a main clause ("Nobody...delicatessen") and a subordinate clause ("who hates..."), both connected by the conjunction "who". Additionally, the subject-verb agreement is maintained throughout the sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The subject of the second clause ("whoever buys anything on credit") is singular, so the verb in the relative clause should be singular as well. Therefore, it should be "talks" instead of "talk". Additionally, there shouldn't be a comma before the conjunction "and" unless it introduces a independent clause. So the corrected sentence would be "Everybody around here who ever buys anything on credit talks in his sleep."	Everybody around here who ever buys anything on credit talks in their sleep.
0	Semantics	The sentence is grammatically correct but semantically incorrect as it uses "can't" with "remember," implying a lack of ability rather than forgetfulness due to time passing. A more appropriate way to express this idea would be using "forget" instead of "can't remember".	I forgot the name of someone who had misgivings.
0	Syntax	The subject ("No writer, and no playwright") is plural but the verb ("meets") is singular. This creates a mismatch between the subject and the verb, making the sentence grammatically incorrect. To fix it, we need to change the verb from third person singular form ("meets") to third person plural form ("meet").	The corrected sentence would be: "No writer, and no playwright, meet in Vienna."
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a subject-verb agreement error. The subject "no writer, nor any playwright" is plural, but the verb "meets" is singular. It should be changed to "meet".	The corrected sentence would be: "No writers, nor any playwrights, meet in Vienna."
0	Semantics	The sentence is grammatically correct but its meaning is unclear. It seems to be saying that it's uncertain whether or not the speaker will get married, but the inclusion of "any student" suggests a different intended meaning. A more clear way to express the intended meaning might be: "It's not certain whom you will marry among the students."	It's not certain whom you will marry among the students.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Felicia kicked the ball off the bench" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules for English syntax. In this case, the subject ("Felicia") performs the action ("kicked") on the direct object ("the ball"), while also indicating the direction of motion away from something else ("off the bench"). All of these elements are arranged in a way that makes sense and conforms to standard English usage. Therefore, I would rate this sentence as being syntactically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically well-formed because it follows the rules for word order and structure in English. Specifically, the subject ("I") comes before the verb ("sent"), and the object ("the package") comes after the verb. Additionally, there are no missing words or extra words, and all the elements of the sentence are grammatically appropriate for their function.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Sam gave the ball out of the basket" is grammatically correct, but its meaning is ambiguous without additional context. It could mean that Sam removed the ball from inside the basket and handed it to someone, or it could mean that Sam threw the ball out of the basket so that it landed somewhere outside of it. This ambiguity arises due to a syntactic structure known as a prepositional phrase ("out of the basket") whose function in the sentence is unclear. However, since the sentence is grammatical and can be understood in context, I will assume that it is intended to convey a clear message and therefore assign it a score of 1 for being mostly correct.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Sam offered the ball out of the basket" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Sam", who is performing the action "offered". The direct object is "the ball", which is what is being offered. The prepositional phrase "out of the basket" gives additional information about where the ball came from.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Park Square has a festive air" is grammatically correct. It follows the standard subject-verb-object structure found in English sentences. In this case, "Park Square" serves as the subject, "has" functions as the verb, and "a festive air" acts as the object. Moreover, there is no glaring error related to morphological inflections, word choice, or semantic meaning. Therefore, it does not belong to any other category but syntax.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct because it follows standard subject-verb agreement rules; the singular subject "worker" matches with the verb "will have". Additionally, the sentence has a clear structure and order.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in this sentence. The plural subject "no one" requires a plural verb, but "can forgive" is singular. It should be "No one can forgive those comments to you."	The sentence should be "No one can forgive those comments to you."
1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically correct because all of its components are arranged properly, making the meaning clear and understandable. Each part of the sentence contributes to a coherent thought, including the coordinating conjunction "but" linking two independent clauses together. Additionally, the verb tenses are consistent within each clause, following standard rules for sequence of tenses.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically correct because it follows all the rules of English grammar. It has a subject ("Sarah"), a verb ("promised" and "gave"), and an object ("Catherine's old car"). The tense is consistent throughout the sentence, and there are no missing words or punctuation errors.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically correct because it follows the standard structure of a simple sentence (Subject-Verb-Object), where the subject ("I") performs the action denoted by the verb ("lent"), and the object ("the book") receives the action. Additionally, the prepositional phrase "partway to Tony" modifies how the action occurred without disrupting the grammaticality of the sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	This sentence follows the rules of English syntax. It has a subject ("the farmer"), a verb ("loaded"), and an object ("the cart"). The prepositional phrase "with apples" modifies the verb by telling us what the farmer loaded the cart with.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	In the sentence "The farmer dumped the cart with apples," there is a misplaced modifier. Specifically, "with apples" is modifying "cart", but it is placed after "cart". A better way to structure this sentence would be "The farmer dumped the cart full of apples" or "The farmer with apples dumped the cart."	The farmer dumped the cart full of apples.
0	Semantics	The sentence "Martha carved the baby a toy out of wood" contains a semantic error because it implies that Martha carved the toy from the baby rather than for the baby. A more appropriate way to express this idea would be "Martha carved a toy out of wood for the baby."	Martha carved a toy out of wood for the baby.
1	Syntax	In the sentence "The bread cuts easily," there is no morphological, semantic, or other error. However, it is unclear who or what is doing the cutting since transitive verbs like "cut" require a direct object. A more complete sentence might be "John can cut the bread easily." Nevertheless, because syntactically correct sentences do not always need to include all grammatical components for contextual understanding, I will assume that the missing actor is implied by context and rate this as grammatically correct based on syntax alone.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The verb "broke" requires a direct object that describes what was broken. In this case, the direct object should be the thing that was broken rather than the person who experienced the breaking. A more appropriate direct object for this verb would describe an object or body part that can break, such as a vase or finger. For example, a possible revision could be "Janet broke Bill's finger." Alternatively, if Janet caused some kind of harm to Bill himself, then it might make sense to say something like "Janet injured Bill," but without additional context, it seems unlikely that this interpretation is intended here.	Janet broke Bill's finger.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Janet broke the cup" is grammatically correct because it follows standard Subject-Verb-Object word order in English and each word is used correctly in context.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "The visitor rang the bell" is grammatically correct because it follows standard English syntax rules for subject-verb-object word order. The subject ("the visitor") comes first, followed by the verb ("rang"), and then the object ("the bell"). This structure is clear and easy to understand.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence is missing a subject, making it grammatically incorrect. A complete sentence requires both a subject and a predicate. In this case, "we" seems to be implied as the subject but needs to be explicitly stated for proper syntax.	We pulled free.
1	Syntax	The sentence "That movie always shocks people" is grammatically correct. There are no errors in syntax, morphology, or semantics.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The subject ("that movie") and verb ("shocks") agree in number, but there is a missing determiner before the noun "movie". A more complete and grammatically correct version would be: "That movie always shock**s** someone.", where "someone" can be replaced by any object receiving the action of being shocked.	The sentence should be "That movie always shocks someone." if we want to describe it as continuously having such an effect on people; otherwise, without specifying who or what gets shocked, simply stating "That movie always shocks." could work.
0	Syntax	In the sentence "Sharon came the room," there is a syntax error because the subject ("Sharon") and the object ("the room") have been reversed. The correct word order for simple sentences in English is usually Subject-Verb-Object (SVO), so it should be "Sharon came into the room" instead.	Sharon came into the room.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Bill sent a package to Tom" is grammatically correct because it follows standard English syntax rules for word order and structure. It contains a subject ("Bill"), a verb ("sent"), and two objects ("a package" and "to Tom").	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically correct because it follows the rules for word order and structure in English. It contains a subject ("that acorn"), a verb ("will grow"), and an object ("an oak tree"). The modifying phrase "into an oak tree" correctly describes the future state of the subject.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "He turned into a frog" is grammatically correct. There are no errors in syntax, morphology, or semantics.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "I mixed the sugar into the butter" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a simple sentence in English, consisting of a subject ("I"), an auxiliary verb ("mixed," indicating past tense), the direct object ("the sugar") and the prepositional phrase ("into the butter"). This structure allows for clear communication of meaning without any syntactic errors.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence "Brian threw the fence with the stick" is syntactically incorrect because it implies that Brian used the fence as a tool to throw something with the help of the stick. A more likely scenario is that Brian threw something at the fence using a stick. Therefore, a grammatically correct version would be "Brian threw the stick at the fence."	Brian threw the stick at the fence.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Mira condemned Terry for the accident" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure of a simple sentence. In this case, "Mira" is the subject, "condemned" is the verb, and "Terry" is the direct object. The prepositional phrase "for the accident" functions as an adverbial modifier, providing additional information about why Terry was being condemned.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "We investigated the area for bombs" is grammatically correct. It follows standard English syntax rules.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically correct because it follows the subject-verb-object word order in English and all the words are used correctly.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct and well-structured. It follows the standard subject-verb-object pattern, where "they" acts as the subject, "praised" as the verb, and "the dedication in the volunteers" as the object. Morphologically, all words are correctly inflected for number and tense. Semantically, it conveys a clear meaning without any ambiguity. Therefore, there are no errors in terms of syntax, morphology, or semantics.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Semantics	The sentence "The earth was believed to be round" is grammatically correct, but I will provide a brief explanation for clarity. This sentence is semantically correct because it conveys the idea that the belief that the Earth is round has existed in the past. It implies that people used to believe the Earth was round before they had more concrete evidence supporting its spherical shape.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Other Category	The sentence "Sarah smiled a charming smile" is grammatically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Sandra beamed a cheerful welcome" is grammatically correct because it follows standard subject-verb-object word order and uses proper verb tense.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Other Category	The sentence "You've really lived it up" is grammatically correct but its meaning may be unclear without additional context. It is an idiomatic expression that means someone has enjoyed themselves thoroughly or taken advantage of opportunities.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The verb "lift" requires an object to complete its meaning. In this case, there is no noun or pronoun after "lift" for it to act upon. A correct version would be "Paperback books lift easily onto the table," where "easily" modifies how the lifting occurs rather than being the direct object of "lift". Alternatively, if we want "lift" to take an object, a possible correction could be "Paperback books help me lift things onto the table easily", where "things" becomes the direct object of "lift".	Paperback books lift easily onto the table. OR Paperback books help me lift things onto the table easily.
0	Syntax	In present tense, when there is no auxiliary verb, we use a base form of the verb after a subject. Here, 'lifted' is a past participle form of lift. It requires an auxiliary verb such as 'has', 'have' or 'had'. Therefore, the sentence "The books lifted onto the table" is grammatically incorrect.	The sentence should be either "The books lift onto the table" or better yet "They lift the books onto the table".
1	Syntax	The sentence "Jessica loaded boxes under the wagon" is grammatically correct, but the intended meaning may be unclear without additional context. Typically, when loading something onto a vehicle, it would be placed on top rather than underneath. Therefore, while syntactically correct, the sentence could potentially benefit from rephrasing for clarity. However, as per the instructions provided, my task is limited to determining whether the sentence is grammatically correct or not.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically correct because it follows the rules for word order and structure in English. It contains a subject ("Jessica"), a verb ("loaded"), and an object ("boxes") and expresses a complete thought. Additionally, the prepositional phrase "on the wagon" correctly modifies the verb by telling where the action occurred.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence "Jessica crammed boxes at the truck" is grammatically incorrect because it lacks a preposition connecting "boxes" and "truck". A more appropriate way to express this idea would be using the preposition 'into' as follows: "Jessica crammed boxes into the truck."	Jessica crammed boxes into the truck.
0	Syntax	The verb "butter" requires a direct object to complete its meaning. In this case, the direct object should be "toast," but it has been separated from the verb by the preposition "at." A more grammatically correct way to construct this sentence would be "Lora buttered the toast."	The sentence should be "Lora buttered the toast."
1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically well-formed because it follows the rules for word order and structure in English. It contains a subject ("Carla"), a verb ("shoveled"), and an object ("the walk") arranged in the proper sequence for a simple declarative sentence. Additionally, there are no missing words or extraneous elements that would disrupt its coherence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Nora sent the book" is grammatically correct. It follows a typical Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) structure where "Nora" is the subject, "sent" is the verb, and "the book" is the object. All elements are correctly conjugated for tense and number.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is correctly structured according to the rules of English syntax. It contains a subject ("Nora"), a verb ("sent") and two objects ("Peter" and "the book"). Each word is grammatically correct and there are no misplaced phrases or missing words.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Carla slid the book" is grammatically correct. It consists of a noun phrase ("Carla") acting as the subject, followed by a verb phrase ("slid the book"). The verb "slid" agrees with its singular subject "Carla," and the direct object "the book" correctly follows the verb.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence "Carla slid at the book" is syntactically incorrect because the preposition "at" is not used appropriately in this context. Typically, we slide on a surface rather than at something. A more appropriate preposition would be "toward" or "onto," depending on what the intended meaning is.	The corrected sentence could be either "Carla slid toward the book" if she moved herself closer to it, or "Carla slid onto the book" if she managed to get herself sitting on top of it.
1	Syntax	The sentence follows all necessary rules for English syntax. It has a clear subject ("Amanda"), verb ("carried"), and object ("the package"). Additionally, it includes proper prepositional phrases ("to Pamela") that describe where the action took place.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The subject and verb do not agree in number. In this case, "Packages" is plural while "drive" is singular. A possible correction could be "Package drivers find it easy to get to New York," where both subjects ("package drivers" and "it") match the plural form of the verb "find."	Package drivers find it easy to get to New York.
0	Syntax	In the sentence "The chair pushed," it is unclear what is doing the pushing because chairs do not typically have the ability to move themselves. A pronoun such as "it" could be added to clarify what is causing the chair to move ("It pushed the chair"). Additionally, there could be a modifying phrase added to provide more context about who or what did the pushing ("John pushed the chair"). Without additional information, however, the sentence is syntactically incorrect due to its ambiguity.	It pushed the chair. OR John pushed the chair.
1	Syntax	The sentence "We offered a job to her" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "we," and the verb is "offered." The indirect object is "a job," and the direct object is "her." The sentence follows standard English syntax rules.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence "A job offered" is a sentence fragment because it lacks both a subject and a finite verb. In order for a sentence to be grammatically complete, it must have both a subject and a predicate. Here, there is no clear subject and the word "offered" requires an object to make sense. For example, a possible correction could be "Someone offered a job," where "someone" is the subject and "a job" is the direct object.	Someone offered a job.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Brown presented a plaque to Jones" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Brown," who is performing the action of presenting something. The direct object of the verb "presented" is "a plaque," which indicates what Brown is presenting. Finally, "to Jones" tells us who received the plaque. This sentence follows standard English syntax rules for word order, making it a well-formed sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Carmen bought Mary a dress" is grammatically correct. It follows standard Subject-Verb-Object word order, where "Carmen" is the subject, "bought" is the verb, and "Mary a dress" serves as the object.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Carmen obtained the spare part at the hardware store" is grammatically correct. It follows standard English syntax rules for word order and structure.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically correct because it follows the rules for word order and structure in English. The subject ("Michelle") comes before the verb ("kept"), and the object ("the desk with the papers") correctly follows the verb.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Frances hid the presents in the drawer" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object word order in English and all of the words are used appropriately within their respective parts of speech.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "The needle pokes the cloth" is grammatically correct because it follows standard subject-verb-object word order in English. Additionally, the verb "pokes" agrees in number with its singular subject "the needle," and both words match in tense.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Carrie touched that cat" is grammatically correct. It follows standard English syntax rules for word order and structure.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Herman whipped the sugar and the cream" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules for subject-verb agreement, word order, and punctuation in English syntax.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Linda taped the picture to the wall" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Linda," the verb is "taped," and the object is "the picture." The prepositional phrase "to the wall" modifies the verb by telling us where the action took place. All of these elements are arranged in a way that follows standard English syntax rules.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Linda taped the picture onto the wall" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Linda," and the verb is "taped." The direct object is "the picture," and the prepositional phrase "onto the wall" tells us where the action took place.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a simple sentence, consisting of a subject ("the child and her mother") and a verb ("clung"). Additionally, the pronoun "her" correctly refers back to its antecedent "mother," and the adverb "together" provides additional information about how they clung.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Other Category	The sentence is comparing two things using the word "differ," but it lacks a clear point of comparison. A more specific term such as "in color" or "in content" would make the meaning clearer. Without additional context, it's unclear what aspect of the flyers makes them different from each other.	The sentence could be corrected by adding a specific point of comparison: "This flyer and that flyer differ in color."
0	Syntax	The word "apart" should not be used in this context; instead, we use "in" to indicate a difference between two things.	The flyer and that flyer differ in some way.
0	Syntax	In the sentence "The jeweler scribbled the contract with his name," there is a syntactic error because the preposition "with" is being used incorrectly. It suggests that the jeweler's name may have been involved in some way during the signing process, but it doesn't make much sense in this context. Instead, we can use the word "as" to indicate that the jeweler signed the contract using his own name as the signature.	The sentence should be corrected as follows - "The jeweler scribbled the contract with his signature" OR "The jeweler scribbled his name on the contract."
0	Semantics	The sentence contains a semantic error because it is not possible for a gardener to grow an acorn into an oak tree. An acorn is a seed produced by an oak tree and will grow into another oak tree naturally without requiring any effort from a gardener. Therefore, the sentence incorrectly implies that human intervention can transform an acorn into an oak tree through growth.	The gardener planted that acorn, which then grew into an oak tree.
1	Syntax	The sentence "I shaped a loaf" is grammatically correct because it follows standard English syntax rules. It contains a subject ("I"), a verb ("shaped"), and an object ("a loaf"). Additionally, the tense of the verb agrees with the subject, making the sentence understandable and coherent.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	In English, a verb must agree with its subject in number. In this case, the subject "the children" is plural while the verb "amuses" is singular, causing a disagreement between them. A correct form would be "amuse," making the corrected sentence read as "The children amuse."	The children amuse.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Susan whispered the news" is grammatically correct because it follows standard English syntax rules for word order and structure. Specifically, it has a proper subject ("Susan"), verb ("whispered"), and object ("the news") arrangement, known as Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) order. Additionally, there is no misplaced modifier, agreement error between subjects and verbs, or any other syntactical issues present in the sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Susan whispered at Rachel" is grammatically correct, but the choice of preposition is slightly off. In most cases, we whisper something to someone, rather than at them. A more natural way to say it would be "Susan whispered to Rachel." However, since the question asks for a binary response indicating whether the sentence is correct or incorrect, I will still mark it as correct because it does convey the intended meaning, albeit less naturally.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Ellen said that melons were selling well" is grammatically correct because it follows standard English syntax rules for subject-verb agreement, word order, and punctuation. In this case, the subject of the sentence ("Ellen") is followed by a verb tense that agrees with the number of the subject ("said"), and the clause structure is clear and coherent. Therefore, there are no errors related to syntax, semantics, morphology, or any other category.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	In this sentence, there is a missing noun after "about" which makes it grammatically incorrect. The corrected version would be: "Ellen commented on the current conditions."	The sentence should be: "Ellen commented on the current conditions."
1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically correct because it follows the rules for word order and structure in English. The subject ("Ellen") comes before the verb ("warned"), and there is a clear relationship between the different parts of the sentence established through proper use of prepositions ("against").	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Cynthia nibbled on the carrot" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Cynthia," a proper noun, followed by the verb "nibbled," a past tense form of the verb "nibble." The preposition "on" introduces the prepositional phrase "on the carrot," which modifies the verb. The determiner "the" specifies which carrot is being referred to, making it clear and easy for the reader to understand.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Cynthia chews" would be grammatically incorrect because it forms a habitual action using the present tense instead of past tense. However, since the prompt specifies that the action occurred in the past ("chewed"), there is no syntactic error in this case.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Paul laughed at Mary" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a simple sentence, consisting of a subject ("Paul"), an auxiliary verb ("did") implied in the past tense form of the main verb ("laughed"), and an object ("Mary"). Additionally, each word is correctly spelled, and the punctuation is appropriate. Therefore, there are no morphological, semantic, or other issues present in this sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The error in this sentence is syntactic because it relates to the structure of the sentence. Specifically, the verb "wink" requires an object that can be blinked, such as an eye. In this case, the object "her lip" is incorrect because lips do not have the ability to blink. A correct object for this sentence could be "her eye".	Linda winked her eye.
0	Syntax	The verb 'pound' requires a direct object to complete its meaning, but in this case, there is no noun or pronoun after it for the subject 'my heart' to act upon. A more appropriate way to express this idea would be: "My heart is pounding *in my chest*," or "*I can feel* my heart pounding."	The sentence should be either "My heart is pounding in my chest" or "I can feel my heart pounding".
1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically correct as it follows the subject-verb-object structure and all elements are grammatically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically correct as it follows the standard structure of a simple sentence in English - Subject-Verb-Object (SVO): 'the witch' (subject), 'poisoned' (verb), and 'the children' (object).	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is correctly constructed according to the rules of English syntax. It contains a subject ("a grandfather clock"), a verb ("ticked"), and a prepositional phrase ("in the hallway") that modifies the location of the action. All elements are arranged in a logical order, making the sentence easy to understand.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Morphology	The verb "squeak" is an intransitive verb, meaning it does not take a direct object. To use "squeak" transitively (with a direct object), we must add a preposition such as "at" to create the phrasal verb "squeak at". Therefore, the sentence "I squeezed the door" would be more appropriate if the intention is for the subject to cause the action of squeezing on the door. However, without additional context, it's unclear whether this change is necessary.	Either "I squeaked (at) the door" or "I squeezed the door," depending on the intended meaning.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows standard English syntax rules for word order and structure.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is constructed according to proper syntactic rules. It has a subject ("Soaring temperatures"), a predicate verb ("are predicted") and an adverbial modifier of time ("for this weekend"). All elements are put together correctly following the Subject-Verb-Object order.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	In the sentence "The fort fluttered with many flags," there is a syntactic error because inanimate objects, such as forts, cannot flutter; only things that move freely in the wind can do so. A more appropriate verb might be "displayed" or "waved".	The fort displayed many flags.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a sentence, having a subject ("the voices") and a predicate ("echoed in the hall"). Additionally, each word is used correctly in context.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "The stream twists through the valley" is grammatically correct. It follows the standard structure of a simple sentence, consisting of a subject ("the stream"), a verb ("twists") and an object ("through the valley"). The word order is correct, and there are no grammatical errors such as missing punctuation marks or incorrect verb forms.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The present perfect tense should be used instead of the past simple tense because the time expression "yesterday" refers to a specific point in the past. Also, there should be no space between "there" and its following verb. A correct version would be "There presented himself with a wonderful opportunity yesterday" if it's meant to imply something ongoing; otherwise, using the past tense as follows would work too: "A wonderful opportunity presented itself yesterday."	A wonderful opportunity presented itself yesterday.
1	Syntax	The sentence is correctly structured according to the rules of English syntax. It has a clear subject ("a wonderful opportunity"), a verb ("presented") and an adverbial clause ("to him yesterday") that provides additional information about when the action occurred. All elements are grammatically correct and form a coherent sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	In English, we typically say "A little white rabbit jumped" rather than "Out of the box jumped a little white rabbit," because the latter construction can sound awkward and unnatural. The sentence could be improved by adding additional context or information, such as "Out of the box, instead of going into the hat, jumped a little white rabbit." However, without further modification, I would classify the original sentence as grammatically incorrect due to its unusual word order.	A little white rabbit jumped out of the box.
1	Syntax	The sentence is correctly constructed according to the rules of syntax in English. It contains a subject ("Penny"), a verb ("skated") and an object ("the rink"). The word order follows the standard structure for simple sentences in English (Subject-Verb-Object), and there are no grammatical errors in tense, number agreement or word choice.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Jackie accompanied Rose" is grammatically correct. It follows the standard structure of a simple sentence, consisting of a subject ("Jackie") and a predicate ("accompanied Rose"). The verb "accompanied" agrees with its singular subject "Jackie" in number. Additionally, there are no spelling errors or misplaced words.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in this sentence. In English, a singular subject requires a singular verb, while a plural subject requires a plural verb. Here, the subject "many information" is plural but the verb "was" is singular. It should be changed to "were".	Many pieces of information were provided.
0	Morphology	The noun "advice" is uncountable, so it should be used with a singular verb. Therefore, the correct form is "John offers much advice," not "John offers many advices."	The sentence should be: "John offers much advice."
1	Syntax	This sentence is syntactically correct because it follows the rules for forming a well-formed sentence in English. It has a subject ("the cake that Jones got") and a predicate ("was more delicious than the one that Smith got"). Additionally, each clause contains a verb and its corresponding subject, making the sentence easy to understand.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The verb "eat" requires a base form after it, so we need to say "eat less cake and **pastry**", without the article "the". Also, if using "less", the nouns following must be uncountable or plural. Here, "cake" is countable, but since there're many types of cakes, saying "cakes" would sound more natural. However, for simplicity, I will only add 's' to "cake": "We recommend eating less cake and pastries."	We recommend eating less cake and pastries.
1	Syntax	The sentence is correctly constructed according to English syntax rules. It contains a subject ("I"), an auxiliary verb ("saw") and an object complement ("that gas can explode"). Each element agrees in number and tense, making it grammatically sound.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "He washed her" is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple sentence structure, with a subject ("he") and a verb ("washed") in past tense. The object of the sentence is "her". All elements fit together correctly according to English syntax rules.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The verb "wash" requires a direct object to complete its meaning, but there is no direct object in this sentence. A corrected version could be "Wash **yourself**!" or "Wash **the dishes**," where the bolded words serve as the direct objects for the verb "wash".	Wash yourself!
0	Syntax	The sentence "They have no in" is missing a noun or pronoun after "no". In English, we use "no" before a determiner such as "a", "an", or "the". For example, we can say "They have no books" or "They have no apples". Therefore, the sentence needs to be completed to make it grammatically correct.	The corrected sentence could be "They have no income" or "They have nothing," depending on what the speaker wants to express.
0	Syntax	The pronoun "some" is used incorrectly in this context. It should be replaced with a determiner such as "many" or "several". Additionally, there is no need for an apostrophe after "some", since it's being used here as a quantifier rather than indicating possession.	Many of my jobs are in jeopardy.
0	Syntax	The subject-verb agreement rule has been violated in this sentence. In English, a singular subject requires a singular verb and a plural subject requires a plural verb. Here, the singular subject 'the policeman' does not agree with the plural verb 'met'. Therefore, it should be either 'was meeting' or 'met a' before 'several young students.'	Either "It was the policeman who met several young students in the park last night" or "The policeman met several young students in the park last night."
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a question tag "did" but lacks a main verb for it to refer back to. A corrected version could be "Did the policeman meet him in the park?" or "The policeman met him in the park, didn't he?"	Did the policeman meet him in the park?
1	Syntax	The sentence is correctly constructed according to English syntax rules. It contains a subject ("John"), a verb ("put") and an object ("old books"). The prepositional phrase "in the box" modifies the verb by telling us where the action took place.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	In this sentence, there is a missing preposition after the word "proud". A more appropriate way to construct this sentence would be "The monkeys are proud of their leader" or "Proud of their leader, the monkeys gathered around him."	The monkeys are proud of their leader.
0	Syntax	The sentence is lacking a noun or adjective after "very". For example, it could be "John sounded very tired" or "John sounded very loud", but as it stands now, there is no complete thought expressed.	John sounded very tired. OR John sounded very loud. (depending on what is intended by the speaker)
0	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically incomplete and lacks a main verb, making it difficult for the reader to understand the intended meaning. A complete sentence requires both a subject and a predicate. Here, the subject ("I") is present, but there is no predicate (verb) to indicate what action or state the subject is performing or experiencing. As a result, the sentence is syntactically incorrect.	The sentence could be revised as follows: "I am unsure whether I should agree." This version includes a clear predicate ('am unsure') that allows the sentence to express a coherent thought.
1	Syntax	The sentence is correctly constructed according to the rules of English syntax. The subject "John" is followed by a verb "bought," and then there is an object "a book." Finally, we have a prepositional phrase "on the table" modifying the noun phrase "a book."	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically correct because it follows the standard structure of a simple sentence, consisting of a subject ("John"), a verb ("called"), and an object ("the president"). Additionally, the adjective ("a fool") correctly modifies the noun it precedes ("president").	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct but there is a minor spelling mistake. In the word "good", it should be "how well" instead because we use adverbs to modify adjectives such as "well".	I forgot how well beer tastes.
1	Other Category	The sentence provided is grammatically correct and understandable. It follows standard English syntax rules, has appropriate semantic meaning, and all morphemes within the words are used correctly. Therefore, it does not have any errors related to syntax, morphology, or semantics.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The verb tense used in the sentence is incorrect. In the sentence "A good friend is remained to me by him," the past participle form of the verb "remain" ("remained") is used instead of the expected present perfect tense ("has been remaining"). Additionally, there is a preposition error where "to" is inserted between "friend" and "me". The proper construction would be "A good friend has been remaining with me, thanks to him."	A good friend has been remaining with me, thanks to him.
1	Syntax	The sentence "John ate his noodle quietly" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "John," the verb is "ate," and the direct object is "his noodle." The adverb "quietly" modifies the verb "ate."	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "A smith hammered the metal" is grammatically correct because it follows standard subject-verb-object word order and has a clear meaning.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Sandy removed her ballet shoes" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure in English. Additionally, the verb "removed" agrees with its plural subject "she," and the possessive pronoun "her" correctly modifies the noun "ballet shoes."	The sentence is already correct.
1	Semantics	The sentence is understandable and grammatically correct, but it's semantically ambiguous as to whether "this week" refers to the current week or a future week. However, based on context clues, it can be assumed that the intended meaning is a future week. Thus, I would rate this sentence as mostly correct.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Benny worked in a shoe factory when he was a student" is grammatically correct. It has a subject ("Benny"), a verb ("worked") and an object ("a shoe factory"). Additionally, it contains a subordinate clause ("when he was a student") that provides additional information about when Benny worked in the shoe factory.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Everyone hoped that she would sing" is grammatically correct. The subject "everyone" is plural, and it agrees with the verb "hoped". Also, the subordinating conjunction "that" introduces a dependent clause, and the verb tense remains consistent throughout the sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct. It has a subject ("this"), a verb ("proved"), and a complement ("a decisive factor"). The word order is correct as well, making it a syntactically sound sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Semantics	The sentence "The crocodile devoured the doughnut" is grammatically correct but semantically incorrect because it is unlikely for a crocodile to eat a doughnut as they primarily consume meat rather than baked goods. A more appropriate sentence could be "The crocodile devoured the fish".	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "John is afraid of Bill" follows the proper syntactic structure for an English sentence. It has a subject ("John"), a linking verb ("is"), and an object ("Bill").	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence "John put under the bathtub" is syntactically incorrect because it lacks a preposition specifying where John put something. A correct version could be "John put the book under the bathtub."	John put the book under the bathtub.
1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically correct because it follows the rules for word order and structure in English. In this case, the subject ("John") comes before the verb ("placed"), and the object ("Kim") comes after the verb but before the prepositional phrase ("behind the garage").	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence "Kim depends for Sandy" is grammatically incorrect because it lacks a verb indicating what Kim is doing regarding Sandy. A correct version could be "Kim depends on Sandy" or "Kim helps Sandy," depending on the intended meaning.	Kim depends on Sandy.
1	Syntax	The sentence "John put the book in the box" is grammatically correct because it follows standard English syntax rules for word order and structure.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is correctly structured according to the rules of syntax in English. The subject of the sentence, "John," is followed by a verb, "taught," and then the object, "English Syntax," and finally the prepositional phrase "to new students" provides additional information about who or what received the action.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is correctly structured in terms of syntax. It has a subject ("John"), a verb ("regards"), and an object ("Bill"). Additionally, it includes a modifying clause ("as a good friend") that provides more information about how Bill is regarded by John.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Kim put in the box" is grammatically correct but it lacks a clear object of the action. A more complete version would be something like "Kim put the book in the box". As it stands, the sentence is syntactically correct but semantically incomplete.	To make the sentence complete and unambiguous, I would suggest adding an object for the verb "put", such as "Kim put the book in the box."
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the rules for syntax in English. The subject ("the chickens") agrees with the verb tense ("seem"), and there is a clear relationship between the subjects and objects in the sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is correctly constructed according to the rules of syntax in English. The subject ("the rules") and the predicate ("require that the executives be polite") are connected by a linking verb ("require"), and both subjects and verbs agree in number. Additionally, there is no ambiguity or confusion regarding meaning, so semantic interpretation is straightforward. No morphological errors are present either; all words appear in their proper forms for their intended meanings and uses within the sentence structure. Therefore, I conclude that the sentence follows standard syntactic conventions without error.	The rules require that the executives be polite.
0	Syntax	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in this sentence. The third person singular form of the verb "nominate" should be used with the singular noun "Fred," so it should be "nominates" instead of "was nominated." Additionally, there is a missing punctuation mark between the two clauses in the sentence.	The sentence should read as follows: "That Fred nominates Bill was unpopular." However, this revised version still sounds awkward and may require further revision for clarity and naturalness.
1	Syntax	The sentence "They were taking a hard look at possible FTA" is grammatically correct. There are no issues with syntax, morphology, or semantics in this sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The preposition "against" is typically used to indicate opposition or contact, rather than payment. To convey the intended meaning of paying for something, it would be more appropriate to use a different preposition such as "for". Therefore, the correct sentence should be "John paid me for the book."	The sentence should be "John paid me for the book."
1	Syntax	The sentence is correctly written in terms of syntax, as it follows the rules for forming phrases and clauses in English. The subject of the sentence ("the committee") is followed by a verb ("will study"), and then there is a prepositional phrase ("of setting up a national computer network"). The word order is correct, and all elements necessary for meaning are present.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains an incorrect usage of the pronoun "them" as a direct object following the verb "make". In English, we typically use the objective form of personal pronouns ("me", "you", "him", "her", "it", "us", "you", "them") after verbs. Therefore, it would be more appropriate to say "We made **them** BE rude.", but even then, this still implies coercion rather than causality. To express that our actions caused their rudeness without implying coercion, consider rephrasing the sentence: e.g., "Our behavior led them to act rudely."	Our behavior led them to act rudely.
1	Syntax	The sentence "After reading the pamphlet, Judy threw it into the garbage can." is grammatically correct. It follows standard subject-verb-object word order and has a clear temporal relationship established through the use of the adverbial clause "after reading the pamphlet".	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The subject of the sentence contains a compound noun, consisting of students studying English. In such cases where there is a compound noun serving as the subject, we only use the plural form for the primary word (in this case, students), rather than adding -s/-es to both words in the compound noun. Therefore, the verb must agree with the first part of the compound noun. Here, the verb read is incorrect because it does not match the plural form of the subject; instead, uses the third person singular form. To fix this error, change 'reads' to 'read'.	Students studying English read Conrad's Heart of Darkness while at university.
0	Syntax	The sentence is missing a determiner before the word "book". In English, we need to specify if something is singular or plural when referring to it without using articles such as "a", "an" or "the". Therefore, the corrected version would be "I read some of the book" or "I read some books", depending on whether there is only one book being referred to or multiple books.	I read some of the book.
1	Syntax	The sentence is correctly structured from a syntactic perspective. It follows standard subject-verb-object word order and there are no obvious grammatical errors.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a double negative ("neither" and "failed"), which results in a positive statement. To convey the intended meaning (that both students passed), only one negation should be used: "Neither student failed," or better yet, "Both students succeeded."	Both students succeeded.
0	Syntax	In English, we use an article ("a" or "an" for singular countable nouns; "the" for all plural nouns and singular countable nouns when previously mentioned) before a noun. Therefore, it should be "some water," not "some of water".	The sentence is already correct except for the missing article. Here's the corrected version: "I drank some water."
0	Morphology	The noun "hair" should be plural because we are talking about more than one strand of gold-colored hair. Therefore, it should be "golden hairs".	The sentence should be: "It is a golden hairs."
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct and well-structured. The subject "the boy" is clearly identified, followed by a verb "waved," and completed with an object "his father." Additionally, there is a prepositional phrase "in the doorway" that provides more information about the location of the boy. All these elements are arranged correctly following the rules of syntax.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The pronoun "itself" refers back to the subject of the previous clause "that dog". In order for reflexive pronouns like "itself" to be grammatically correct, they must refer back to a noun or pronoun within the same clause. Since "that dog" and "it" do not appear in the second clause, replacing "itself" with another form such as "it" would make the sentence grammatical: "That dog is so ferocious, it even tried to bite it." However, I understand what you meant; changing the structure slightly could fix the problem while preserving the intended meaning: "So ferocious is that dog, it even tried to bite itself."	So ferocious is that dog, it even tried to bite itself.
0	Syntax	The verb "washed" requires an object pronoun ("you"), but instead a reflexive pronoun ("yourself") is used. This results in incorrect syntax because it suggests that the subject is performing the action on themselves when no such indication has been made.	He washed you.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a misplaced modifier error. In the current structure, it implies that Kim is easy to please rather than John being easy to please. To fix this issue, we need to place "John" next to "easy to please," so the corrected version would be: "John is easy to please." OR "Kim finds John easy to please."	John is easy to please.
0	Syntax	The sentence is missing a noun after "intelligent" for the verb "to be" to agree with grammatically. A possible correction could be "There seemed to be an intelligent person there," making the corrected sentence "There seemed to be an intelligent person there."	There seemed to be an intelligent person there.
1	Syntax	The sentence is correctly structured according to English syntax rules. It contains a subject ("John"), a verb ("tried") and an object ("to please Stephen"). All elements are grammatically correct and coherent.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Semantics	The sentence is grammatically well-formed but semantically incorrect because it asserts something illogical - people cannot believe someone to be an inanimate object such as a fountain.	The sentence is not correct. A possible correction would be 'We believed John to be reliable' if reliability is what we intended to ascribe to him.
0	Syntax	The subject ("it") does not agree with its verb ("tries"). In general, singular nouns require a third-person singular present tense verb form ending in "-s" or "-es," so the correct form here would be "try." Additionally, it's unclear what "it" refers to; more context would help clarify who or what is trying to leave the country.	The person tries to leave the country.
1	Syntax	The sentence "John tries to leave the country" is grammatically correct. It follows the standard structure of a simple sentence in English, consisting of a subject ("John") and a predicate ("tries to leave the country"). Additionally, it uses appropriate tense, mood, and word order.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence appears grammatically correct, with no obvious errors in syntax or word choice.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in this sentence. "There" is a singular subject, so it requires a singular verb form such as "is". However, "be" is used here instead, which is plural. This makes the sentence grammatically incorrect.	The sentence should read: "There is believed to be a sheep in the park." Or for better style: "Sheep are believed to be in the park."
0	Syntax	The word "would" is used incorrectly after "hope". We use "will" instead of "would" when we express a strong desire for something to happen in the future. Therefore, the correct formulation here is "I hope to **will** study in France", but it's more common to say simply "I hope to study in France."	I hope to study in France.
1	Syntax	The sentence is correctly constructed according to the rules of English syntax. It contains a subject ("John"), an auxiliary verb ("can"), and a predicate ("kick the ball"). The subject agrees with the verb in number.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	In English, subject pronouns such as "he," "she," and "they" can be used for people, while "it" is used for things and animals. The word "will" indicates future tense, but it cannot replace a subject pronoun. Therefore, "John will rain tomorrow" is incorrect because "will" is being misused as a subject. A more appropriate way to say this would be "It will rain tomorrow" if referring to weather or "John will do something tomorrow" if talking about his actions.	It will rain tomorrow.
0	Syntax	The subject ("there") and auxiliary verb ("expect") must agree in number. Therefore, the plural form of the auxiliary verb ("expects") should be used instead of "expect" because "there" is singular. Moreover, it's more idiomatic to say "It is expected to rain," rather than saying "We expect there to rain."	It is expected to rain.
1	Syntax	The sentence "John was found in the office" is grammatically correct. It follows standard subject-verb-object word order and uses proper tense ("was found") to indicate past action. Additionally, prepositional phrase "in the office" correctly modifies location of the action.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The auxiliary verb "did" must be followed by a past tense verb, but in this case it's followed by the base form "be," resulting in incorrect syntax. Additionally, there is no need for both "did" and "be" in the same question; only one auxiliary verb is required. A correct version would simply use "was" or "were": e.g., "Was the child in the school?" or "Were the children in the school?"	Was the child in the school?
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct and well-formed. There are no errors in subject-verb agreement, word order, or tense consistency.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a double negative ("not" and "never"), which can lead to confusion about what the speaker intends to convey. In modern English, it's generally recommended to avoid using two negatives in the same clause when expressing a negative idea. Instead, we typically use only one negative word or phrase.	The corrected sentence could be either "John doesn't want to leave the town" or "John wants to stay in the town," depending on the intended meaning.
1	Syntax	The sentence is correctly structured according to the rules of English syntax. Each clause contains a subject ("Mary" and "Bill") and a verb ("likes" and "hates"), and they are connected by a coordinating conjunction ("but"). Additionally, the use of the infinitive marker "to" after each verb is grammatically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a double negative, which results in a logically inconsistent meaning. In standard English, we avoid using two negatives in the same clause because it can lead to confusion. Here, "needn't" itself means "do not need to," so combining it with "not" creates a contradiction. A better way to express the idea would be to say, "They don't have to take this exam."	They don't have to take this exam.
1	Syntax	The sentence is correctly constructed according to the rules of English syntax. Each word has been used appropriately and placed in a way that makes sense grammatically.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is correctly written according to the rules of English syntax. It consists of two independent clauses joined by a conjunction ("but"), each with its own subject-verb agreement.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is a question formed using subject-auxiliary inversion ("has" comes before "he"). It is grammatically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The correct form of the verb to be after "scarcely" is "could," but it needs to agree with a singular subject, so it should be "he could scarcely do anything worth mentioning."	The sentence is already correct except for the agreement between "scarcely" and "he," so the corrected version would be: "As a statesman, he scarcely could do anything worth mentioning."
1	Syntax	The sentence appears to be grammatically correct, as it follows standard subject-verb-object word order and proper agreement between the subject ("we") and verb ("found"). Additionally, there are no apparent morphological errors such as incorrect tense usage or misspelled words.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence appears to be grammatically correct, with a clear subject ("One of Korea's most famous poets"), verb ("wrote"), and direct object ("these lines"). The modifying phrases "of Korea's" and "most famous" correctly describe the noun they precede. The use of the definite article "these" before "lines" indicates that specific lines are being referred to.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence appears to be grammatically correct, with a clear subject ("somebody"), verb ("struck"), and object ("the unidentified victim"). It also includes appropriate determiners before each noun and uses time adjuncts correctly to provide context for when the action took place.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "The car was driven" is grammatically correct. The subject "the car" is clearly identified, and the verb tense is consistent throughout the sentence. Additionally, there are no obvious spelling or punctuation errors.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Ricky can be relied on" is grammatically correct because it follows standard subject-verb-complement syntax where "Ricky" is the subject, "can be relied" is the verb, and "on" indicates the preposition introducing the complement. The word choice and phrasing create a clear meaning without ambiguity.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The past participle form of a verb can be used as an adjective to describe the subject of a sentence. In this case, "slept" describes the state of the bed after someone has slept in it. This usage is grammatically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	In the sentence "A pound was weighed by the book," there is a mistake in terms of agency. The subject of the sentence, "a pound," cannot be the thing being weighed because it is inanimate. Instead, the doer of the action, i.e., the entity doing the weighing, should come before "by". Therefore, the correct formulation would be "The book weighed a pound" or "A pound was weighed using the book as a unit of measurement."	The book weighed a pound.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a question tag ("don't you") that does not agree with the subject ("I"). Additionally, there is no clear antecedent for the pronoun "he". A corrected version could be: "Who do you think he saw?"	Who do you think he saw?
1	Syntax	The sentence "he had spent five thousand dollars" is grammatically correct. It follows a clear subject-verb-object structure, where the subject "he" has performed the action denoted by the verb "had spent", and the object "five thousand dollars" receives the action. Additionally, there is no apparent error in word choice, spelling, punctuation, or morphological inflection. Therefore, I will rate this sentence as syntactically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a syntactic error because it lacks a proper subject-verb agreement. Specifically, the verb "knows" requires a singular noun as its subject, but instead, we have two possible subjects ("Fed" and "which politician") connected by the conjunction "and," making it plural. Moreover, there is no clear antecedent for the pronoun "her."	Either "Fed knows which politician she should vote for." or "Fed and which politician he should vote for."
0	Syntax	The question contains a verb tense error, specifically with the use of the simple past tense "fixed" instead of the past perfect tense "had fixed". This mistake leads to confusion about whether the action of fixing the computer occurred before or after another relevant event in the context.	How had you guessed that he fixed the computer?
1	Syntax	The sentence is correctly written according to the rules of syntax in English. It contains a main clause ("the committee knows") and a subordinate clause ("whose efforts to achieve peace the world should honor"). Both clauses contain appropriate subjects and verbs, and they are properly connected by the relative pronoun "whose".	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The verb "does" must agree in number with the subject "which house". Since "house" is singular, we need to use "does" instead of "do". Additionally, a question word ("which") needs to be followed by a comma when used at the beginning of a sentence. Therefore, the correct form would be: "Which house does your friend live in?"	Which house does your friend live in?
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct. It uses a relative clause ("from whom I bought these bagels") to modify the noun phrase "the baker". This structure is syntactically correct and follows the rules for forming relative clauses in English.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Other Category	The sentence appears to be grammatically correct; however, it lacks context for me to fully determine if there are any semantic errors. Nonetheless, without further information, I will assume it's correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The preposition "with" is only needed once in this sentence. A correct version would be "Jack is the person whom Jenny fell in love with." Alternatively, for more informal contexts, "Jack's the person Jenny fell in love with" works as well.	Jack is the person Jenny fell in love with.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct and the words are all used appropriately.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is correctly structured according to English syntax rules. It contains a subject ("I"), a verb ("met"), and a clause introduced by the relative pronoun "who" that modifies the noun "man". The clause provides additional information about the identity of the man being referred to.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The pronoun "his" does not have a clear antecedent in the sentence. It could refer to "you," but that would imply that the listener is choosing a topic for the speaker, which is unlikely. To fix the syntax error, we need to specify who gave the approval or rephrase the question so that it doesn't require an antecedent for "his." For example: "Which topic did you choose without getting her approval?" or "Without seeking anyone's approval, which topic did you choose?"	Without seeking his approval, which topic did you choose?
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a pronoun ("which") without a clear antecedent. It's unclear what "which" refers to - the topic of Mary's conversation or the fact that the speaker got bored. A possible correction would be: "I got bored with the topic that Mary kept talking about."	The sentence I got bored with the topic that Mary kept talking about is already correct.
1	Semantics	This sentence is grammatically correct but its meaning might be unclear without additional context. The pronoun "he" requires a clear antecedent for the sentence to make sense. For example, if we know who "he" refers to then the sentence would be fine. However, based solely on what's provided here, it's difficult to determine whether the sentence has been used appropriately.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Other Category	The sentence "It bothers me that John coughs" is grammatically correct but may be pragmally odd depending on the context. Pragmatics refers to how language is used in a social context. In some situations, it might seem impolite or judgmental to say that someone's actions bother you. However, if we assume that the sentence is being used appropriately, then there is no grammar mistake.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The verb "to please" requires a direct object, but there is no noun or pronoun after it in this sentence. A corrected version could be "To please John is easy for me," where "me" is the direct object. Alternatively, "It is easy to please John" would also work.	It is easy to please John.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Kim is eager to please Tom" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a simple sentence in English: subject ("Kim") + auxiliary verb ("is") + adjective ("eager") + infinitive verb ("to please") + object ("Tom"). All words are used correctly, and there are no missing or extra elements.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The subject "that we invaded Iraq" is a dependent clause and cannot be used as the subject of a sentence without modification. A possible solution would be to recast the sentence so that it uses a noun or pronoun as the subject, such as "Invading Iraq really bites," or by making the clause independent ("We invaded Iraq; that really bites").	Invading Iraq really bites.
0	Syntax	The subject ("It") and verb ("annoys") do not agree in number; they must both be either singular or plural. In this case, "it" is singular while "barks" is plural, so the sentence is grammatically incorrect.	The sentence should read "That annoys me that Fido barks," where "that" functions as a conjunction introducing the clause "Fido barks". Alternatively, if we want to keep "It", then the corrected version would be "It annoys me that Fido is barking."
0	Syntax	The issue with this sentence lies in its syntax, specifically in word order. In declarative sentences such as this one, the subject ("Angela") typically comes before the verb ("was"). However, here we have a case where the predicate adjective phrase ("achieved...best result") has been incorrectly placed between them, creating confusion about who actually achieved the best result. A correct version would be either "Angela achieved the best result" or "The best result was achieved by Angela," depending on context and desired emphasis.	The best result was achieved by Angela.
1	Syntax	The sentence is correctly structured in terms of syntax. A noun phrase ("the peasant girl") functions as the subject, followed by a verb phrase ("got it"). Additionally, there is no ambiguity regarding the meaning of the sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The subject-auxiliary inversion error occurs when we form a question or use a negative word such as 'anyone' in our statement. Here, 'to find' needs to come before 'anyone.' A correct version would be 'That kind of person is hard to find anyone who can look after [him/her].'	The corrected sentence is - 'That kind of person is hard to find anyone who can look after [him/her].'
0	Semantics	The sentence is grammatically correct but semantically incorrect because it suggests a negative ability rather than negating an action. An alternative way to express this idea would be "A healthy owl hunts mice better than a sick owl does" or simply "A sick owl hunts poorly".	The sentence "A sick owl hunts poorly" is more appropriate for conveying the intended meaning without creating confusion regarding its grammatical structure.
0	Syntax	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in this sentence. The plural noun "candidates" requires a plural verb form such as "will be admitted". Therefore, the verb "has" should be changed to "have". Additionally, it would sound more natural to say "those candidates" instead of just "candidates", but this is not strictly necessary for grammatical correctness.	Each candidate who has interest in semantics will be admitted to the department. OR: Each candidate who has interests in semantics will be admitted to the department.
0	Syntax	The subject of the second clause ("it") does not agree with its verb ("was"). Additionally, there is a missing article before "English translation".	Each author who contributes in a language other than English must provide an English summary, and it was required to have been translated accurately.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a subject-verb agreement error. The verb "got" does not agree in number with its plural subject "we". It should be changed to "have gotten" or simply "gotten", since both forms are acceptable in American English.	We have certainly obtained these tickets! Or: We surely got these tickets!
0	Syntax	The double negation in the sentence ("even" and "not") creates a contradiction. A more appropriate way to express uncertainty would be "I'm just not sure we have these tickets!" or "I'm unsure if we have these tickets!"	The corrected sentence could be "I'm just not sure we have these tickets!"
1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically correct. There are no grammatical errors, and the words are arranged correctly.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Semantics	The sentence is logically consistent and grammatically correct, but it can be improved for better clarity. A more clear way to express the same idea would be: "I'm not angry because Sue said something bad about me." This revised version places a stronger emphasis on the negation ("not") and makes the cause-effect relationship between Sue's comments and the speaker's anger more explicit. However, as stated earlier, the original sentence does not contain any grammatical errors; hence, it falls under semantic improvements rather than syntactic corrections.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a comma splice error, where two independent clauses ("he was hungry" and "John whined") are incorrectly joined by only a comma. This results in a run-on sentence.	Corrected Sentence: He was hungry, so John whined. OR He was hungry; therefore, John whined.
0	Syntax	In English, we usually put the indirect object before the direct object. So instead of saying "I gave Mary after the party a book," it would be more natural to say "I gave a book to Mary after the party" or simply "After the party, I gave Mary a book."	After the party, I gave Mary a book.
0	Syntax	The second clause "as for Mary I really like her" contains a misplaced conjunction "as". It would be better to say "As for Mary, I really like her." This way, "as for" introduces the new subject more clearly.	As for Mary, I really like her.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct. Although there is a comma splice error (two independent clauses joined by only a comma), the coordinating conjunction 'but' after the comma makes up for the error and allows both clauses to be properly connected.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The subject ("With no job") is a prepositional phrase, but there is no finite verb for it to modify. A better way to say this would be "John would not be happy without a job" or "Without a job, John would not be happy," where "would not be happy" is the predicate verb phrase that goes with the subject.	Without a job, John would not be happy.
0	Syntax	The error in this sentence is related to subject-verb agreement. In this case, "much" is a determiner that indicates quantity and it requires a plural noun as its complement. Therefore, the verb must be plural too. So instead of "has," we need to use "have".	I have many pages of the manuscript left to type. Reference(s): https://www.grammarly.com/blog/subject-verb-agreement/#:~:text=Subject%2Dverb%20agreement%20is%20a,to%20make%20their%20sentences%20clearer.
1	Syntax	The sentence "He's a more reliable man" is grammatically correct. Here, "he's" is a contraction for "he is," and it serves as the subject of the sentence. "More reliable" functions as an adjective describing the noun "man." Therefore, there is no syntactic error in this sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The subject ("Any trouble") is singular, but the verb ("is") is plural. This creates a mismatch between the number agreement of the subject and the verb. In order for the syntax to be corrected, either "any" needs to be removed so that "trouble" becomes the subject and takes a singular verb form ("Trouble is..."), or the verb can be changed to its singular form ("Any trouble is...").	Either "Trouble is what I don't want," or "Any is what I don't want."
1	Semantics	The sentence "They may grow as high as bamboo" is grammatically correct but semantically it's unclear what is being referred to by "they". Bamboo can refer both to a plant and to a type of food, so without additional context, we cannot be sure if the sentence means that other things can grow as tall as bamboo plants or if they can become as popular as bamboo dishes.	The sentence is almost correct; however, for clarity, I would suggest specifying who or what might grow as high as bamboo. For example: "These plants may grow as high as bamboo."
0	Syntax	The subject-verb agreement rule states that a singular subject requires a singular verb, while a plural subject requires a plural verb. In this case, "some" is acting as a plural subject, so it requires a plural verb form such as "make," rather than the incorrect singular form "makes."	Some of them made as many errors as twenty. OR The sentence is already correct if we interpret "some of them" collectively as a single entity requiring a singular verb ("makes"). However, for clarity and precision, I recommend using the plural verb form ("make") to avoid potential confusion regarding the number of entities being referred to by "some of them."
0	Syntax	The reflexive pronoun used here should be "himself" rather than "hisself," as "himself" correctly agrees with the subject "Sally" in number and gender.	The corrected sentence would be: "Sally kissed herself."
1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically well-formed as it follows the subject-verb-object pattern correctly. The subjects ("Drew" and "I") have their respective verbs ("believes" and "think"), and these verb phrases take on complements ("Rosie loves magazine ads"). Each word plays its role appropriately according to the rules governing syntax.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is correctly written in terms of syntax as it follows the rules for word order and structure in English. It contains a subject ("Dave, Dan, Erin, Jaime, and Alina") and a verb ("left"), and each element in the list of names is separated by a comma until the last two which are connected by "and".	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct, there are no errors in word order or form, and all words are used appropriately in context.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in this sentence. The verb "shows" does not agree with its singular subject "leather". It should be changed to a plural form such as "show" to match the plural subject "Blue leather". Additionally, there seems to be some confusion about the intended meaning of the sentence - it's unclear what "Blue leather" refers to, and whether it is supposed to be the subject or object of the sentence.	The sentence is not correct. Here is a corrected version: "The blue leather handbag shows off how pretty Betsy is."
1	Syntax	The sentence "Gwen hit the baseball" is grammatically correct because it follows standard English syntax rules for subject-verb-object word order.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in this sentence. "Hit" is a singular verb and requires a singular subject, but "that" refers to multiple things, so it requires a plural verb. A better way to word the sentence would be "I can tell that you know the answer."	I can tell that you know the answer.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct. It uses a correlative conjunction ("or") to connect two independent clauses. Each clause has its own verb ("have lost"). This structure is often used for making alternative statements where only one part needs to be true.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is correctly constructed according to the rules of syntax in English. The subject “a brand new car” is followed by the verb “he bought.” Additionally, there is proper agreement between the subject and the verb, as well as appropriate word order.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "He likes cookies and he hates crumb cake" is grammatically correct. It consists of two independent clauses ("he likes cookies" and "he hates crumb cake") joined by a coordinating conjunction ("and"). Each clause has a subject ("he") and a verb ("likes," "hates"), so it follows basic rules for sentence structure.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "They chased the man with the car" is grammatically correct. Here's a breakdown of its syntax: * "They" is a subject pronoun. * "chased" is the verb, specifically a past tense regular verb. * "the man" is the direct object. It receives the action of the verb. * "with the car" is a prepositional phrase modifying how they chased the man. Therefore, there are no errors in the syntax of this sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence "I didn't have a red cent" is semantically understandable but grammatically incorrect because it lacks an auxiliary verb after "didn't". In negative statements without a modal verb, we need an auxiliary verb ("do", "does", or "did") before the main verb. Therefore, the correct form would be "I didn't have a red cent **to my name**" or simply "I had no money."	I didn't have a red cent to my name.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains two independent clauses ("the book of poems takes a very long time to read" and "from Blackwell takes a very long time to read") but lacks proper coordination between them using conjunctions such as 'and' or punctuation like a semicolon. This results in a syntactically incorrect structure.	The corrected sentence could be either "The book of poems from Blackwell takes a very long time to read," if both phrases describe the same book; otherwise, it would be: "The book of poems and the one from Blackwell take a very long time to read."
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct but it could be improved for clarity. It would be clearer if we specify who or what is taking a long time to read. I assume that the intended meaning is that the book with a red cover takes a long time to read, so a better version of the original sentence might be: "Reading the book with the red cover takes a very long time."	Reading the book with the red cover takes a very long time.
1	Syntax	The sentence is correctly structured according to the rules of English syntax. It contains a subject ("John"), a verb ("has") and an object ("a fear of dogs"). All elements are grammatically correct and agree in number.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	In English, a noun usually follows an article such as "the" immediately. Here, "is" breaks the connection between "the" and "roof", making the sentence incorrect. A corrected version would be "The roof of the building is leaking".	The roof of the building is leaking.
0	Syntax	The noun phrase "the panther's" functions as a determiner for the noun "coat," but it is incorrect because determiners cannot be modified by articles such as "the". Therefore, the correct form should be "the panther's coat is dark black."	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is correctly structured according to the rules of English syntax. Colin is identified as the subject performing the action of asking, and the clause "they could get a mortgage" functions as the direct object of the verb "asked," indicating what Colin is inquiring about.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Semantics	This sentence is semantically incorrect because it implies that the man who got into the taxi committed the robbery. However, without additional context, we cannot be sure if the speaker witnessed the same person committing both actions. It's possible that the speaker saw one person getting into a cab and then saw someone else robbing the bank later on. Therefore, the causality between these two events is unclear and makes the sentence misleading.	The man I saw rob the bank had gotten into a cab earlier.
1	Syntax	The sentence is correctly structured according to the rules of English syntax. It has a subject ("I"), a helping verb ("do"), an auxiliary verb ("know"), and an object ("asparagus"). All words are used appropriately, and they follow each other in a logical order.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically correct because it follows the standard structure of a simple sentence in English (Subject + Verb + Object), where "John's drum" serves as the subject, "will always bother" functions as the verb, and "me" acts as the object. Additionally, all words are used appropriately according to their part of speech, and there are no grammatical errors such as missing punctuation marks, incorrect word order, or agreement issues between subjects and verbs.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Other Category	The sentence "An evil thought struck Dave" is grammatically correct but it might be culturally insensitive as it reinforces a harmful stereotype about people who have mental health issues being labeled as "evil". A more sensitive way to express this idea would be "A troubling thought occurred to Dave."	The sentence is already correct, although I recommend considering using a less stigmatizing phrasing such as "A troubling thought occurred to Dave."
1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically correct because it follows the rules for word order and structure in English. It contains a subject ("John"), a verb ("put"), and an object ("the book") and indicates where the action took place ("on the table").	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is correctly structured with appropriate subject-verb agreement and proper word order. Additionally, it has a prepositional phrase ("to the soldier") that modifies the verb giving more information about who received the medal.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The verb "to eat" needs to agree with its subject in number and person. In this case, it should be the base form "eat", because the subject "Andy" is a singular noun. Also, we need a conjunction such as "for" between "thinks" and "Andy". So, the corrected sentence would be: "Heidi thinks for Andy to eat salmon-flavored candy bars." However, this still sounds awkward, so I suggest rephrasing the whole sentence to make it more natural, e.g., "Heidi thinks Andy should eat salmon-flavored candy bars."	Heidi thinks Andy should eat salmon-flavored candy bars.
1	Semantics	The sentence is grammatically correct but may be semantically odd because it combines two concepts that don't usually go together - eating candies that have a savory fish flavor. However, if such candies exist and Heidi recommends them for any reason, there would be no grammatical errors in this statement.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is simple but grammatically correct. It consists of a single verb in past tense ("danced") and it follows all syntax rules for English language.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a subject-verb agreement error. In English, subjects and verbs must agree in number; that is, if the subject is singular, then the verb must be singular as well, and vice versa. Here, the subject ("Calvin") is singular, but the verb ("did") is plural, which results in a grammatical error known as a subject-verb disagreement. To fix this error, we can change the verb to its singular form by writing "Did Calvin do his homework?" instead.	Did Calvin do his homework?
1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically correct because it follows the rules for word order and structure in English. It contains a subject ("Sylvia"), verb ("was slapping"), and object ("Jeff") and uses prepositional phrases correctly to provide additional information about where the action took place.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is correctly structured according to English syntax rules. It contains a conditional clause ("If I am a rich man") followed by a main clause ("I'd buy a diamond ring"). Both clauses contain subject-predicate structures and follow the standard word order for declarative sentences in English.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is correctly written according to the rules of syntax in English. It uses the subjunctive mood ("he were") to express a hypothetical situation, which is followed by the conditional clause ("he'd buy").	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "John is likely to leave" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "John", followed by a linking verb "is", and then the predicate adjective "likely". Finally, we have the infinitive phrase "to leave" acting as the complement of the adjective "likely".	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	This sentence follows the rules for syntactically correct sentence structure in English. It consists of a single independent clause, where the subject ("the manager") is followed by the verb ("laughed"). No additional information about who or what was being managed is provided, but it does not affect the grammaticality of the sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence "Was sunk" is a verb form but it lacks a proper subject and context for it to be grammatically correct. It seems to be a fragment of a complete sentence rather than a standalone statement. For instance, if we have a full sentence such as "The ship was sunk," then it would be correct; otherwise, without any additional information, I will assume it's incorrect.	The sentence is already correct if completed with appropriate context, e.g., "The ship was sunk."
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a common grammatical error known as a question fragment. A complete question requires both an auxiliary verb and a subject. In this case, the subject ("you") is implied rather than explicitly stated, leading to an incorrect sentence structure.	The corrected version of the sentence would be, "Who do you think kissed the gorilla?" This formulation includes both the required auxiliary verb ("do") and its corresponding subject ("you").
1	Syntax	The sentence is correctly structured and there are no errors in subject-verb agreement, tense usage, word order, or punctuation. All the words used in the sentence have been employed appropriately according to their meanings.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence appears to be grammatically correct. The subject "Lucy" has a verb agreement with "was," indicating past tense. Additionally, there is a passive construction using the auxiliary verb "was" followed by the past participle "mugged." This creates a complete thought, making it syntactically sound.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "I ate a salad that was filled with lima beans" is grammatically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "There were four men arriving at the station when I pulled up" is grammatically correct. The subject-auxiliary inversion ("were there") is used appropriately for a question embedded within a clause. Additionally, verb tense is consistent throughout the sentence, with all verbs appearing in past tense.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Jean is reluctant to dance" is grammatically correct. The subject "Jean" is clearly identified, and the verb tense is consistent throughout the sentence. Additionally, there is a preposition ("to") followed by the gerund form of the verb "dance," indicating that Jean is hesitant about performing this action himself.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically well-formed as it follows the standard structure of a simple sentence - subject ("I") followed by a verb ("want") and an infinitive clause ("her to dance"). The pronouns used in the sentence have clear antecedents, and there are no missing words or extra words.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Jean persuaded Robert" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a simple sentence in English: subject + verb + object. In this case, "Jean" is the subject, "persuaded" is the verb, and "Robert" is the object.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Jean wants Bill to do the Macarena" is grammatically correct. There are no errors in syntax, morphology, or semantics.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the rules for subject-verb agreement and word order in English. The subject of the sentence is "the children," which is plural, so the verb "admire" is also in its plural form. Additionally, the modifier "their mother" correctly describes who the children are admiring.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct but it lacks context, so we don't know if it's referring to a specific person named Peter or not. It would be better to say "Who has he talked with?" or provide more information about who Peter is.	The sentence is almost correct, just add some context for clarity. For example: "I heard Peter had a long conversation yesterday; who has he talked with?"
1	Syntax	The sentence "Heidi likes her violin" is grammatically correct. It follows a simple subject-verb-object structure where "Heidi" is the subject, "likes" is the verb, and "her violin" is the object. The use of possessive pronoun "her" before "violin" correctly indicates possession.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The error in this sentence lies in the pronoun choice. The reflexive pronoun used here should be "himself" if John is referring to a male subject. However, since "Mary" is the object of her affection, using "himself" would still result in an incorrect sentence because it refers back to the wrong noun ("John"). A corrected version could use "he likes himself," or "she loves him" instead.	John thinks that Mary loves him.
0	Syntax	The possessive form 'himself' is incorrect because we need a reflexive pronoun instead. In this case, it should be 'his', so the correct question would be "Which pictures of his does John like?"	Which pictures of his does John like?
0	Syntax	The subject "Any owl" is singular but the verb "hunts" is plural, which creates a mismatch between the number agreement of the subject and the verb. It should be "hunts" instead of "hunt".	Any owl hunts mice.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a double negative ("any" + "didn't"), which results in a positive statement instead of a negative one. This error violates the rule against multiple negatives in standard English grammar.	Either "No man ate dinner" (if emphasizing nonexistence) or "Any man ate dinner" (if questioning existence or identity).
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct. The modal verb "could" indicates possibility, and it agrees with the subject "a pilot". The word "flying" correctly functions as a gerund here, acting as the predicate of the sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct. It uses a relative clause ("whoever they were") to modify the noun "everybody" from the previous clause. This construction is used for emphasis and clarification, making it clear that regardless of who the people were who attended last week's rally, all of them signed the petition.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is correctly structured according to the rules of English syntax. It contains a subject ("Anybody who attended last week's huge rally"), a verb ("signed"), and an object ("the petition"). The word order is correct, and there are no missing or extra words.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Semantics	The statement "Any tiger has orange fur, marked with black stripes" is semantically incorrect because it uses the wrong quantifier for a general description of all tigers. Instead of 'any', we need to use 'all' or 'every'. Also, using singular nouns ('a tiger') instead of plural ones ('tigers') would make the statement more natural-sounding.	All tigers have orange fur, marked with black stripes.
0	Semantics	The statement "Any albino tiger has orange fur" is a semantic error because it is biologically impossible for an albino animal to have fur color other than white due to lack of melanin pigment. Albinism results in complete or partial absence of pigment in skin, hair, and eyes. Thus, an albino tiger would have white fur instead of orange.	An albino tiger has white fur, sometimes marked with pale or barely visible stripes.
0	Syntax	The verb 'must' requires a base form of the verb after it, so 'picks' should be used instead of 'pick'.	You must pick any flower you see.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows standard English syntax rules for word order and structure.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically correct because it follows the rules of English word order and structure. It contains a subject ("you"), a verb ("are"), and two independent clauses connected by the coordinating conjunction "but". Each clause has its own complete thought: "You may pick every flower" and "leave a few for Mary."	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically correct as it follows the rules for word order and structure in English. It contains two independent clauses joined by the conjunction "and," each with its own subject ("the Dodgers") and verb ("beat" and "were beaten").	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct but it lacks context. It's unclear what information the speaker wants about the location of the car where the man was seen. A preposition such as "in," "on," or "at" would be needed for a complete sentence. For example: "In which car was the man seen?" or "On which car was the man seen?" or "At which car was the man seen?"	The sentence is already correct, but here is an example of how it could be completed: "In which car was the man seen?"
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the rules for syntax in English. It contains a subject ("the man") and a predicate ("who Mary loves and Sally hates computed my tax"). Additionally, the relative clause "who Mary loves and Sally hates" modifies the noun "man" appropriately.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct. It contains a noun clause "which Mary made and Fido sleeps" that functions as the object of the verb "has been stolen". This noun clause modifies the noun "kennel", providing additional information about it. The subject-verb agreement is also correct.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Tom said he would and Bill actually did eat a raw eggplant" is syntactically correct because it follows the rules for word order and structure in English. It contains two independent clauses joined by the coordinating conjunction "and," making it grammatically sound.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically correct because it follows the rules of English word order and structure. It contains a subject ("the wealthy young man"), a verb ("bought"), and an object ("that piano") and has a prepositional phrase modifying the object ("for his secret fiancée"). All these elements combine correctly to form a grammatically sound sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	This sentence is syntactically correct because it follows the rules for word order and structure in English. The subject ("the dog") comes before the verb ("stole"), and the object ("the turkey") comes after the verb. Additionally, each word is correctly formed and inflected.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Other Category	The sentence fragment "a tall building" is grammatically complete but lacks context for a full evaluation. In isolation, it appears to be syntactically correct as there are no grammatical errors present. However, without more information about what action or state this noun phrase might describe, we cannot definitively assess its semantic accuracy.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "This building is tall" is grammatically correct because it follows standard English syntax rules for subject-verb-predicate agreement. The subject "this building" is singular, so the verb "is" must also be singular. The predicate "tall" correctly describes the subject by indicating its size.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is correctly constructed according to English syntax rules. It consists of a noun phrase ("I") followed by a verb phrase ("like the book which you gave me"). Both the subject and predicate contain all necessary components.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Captain Wentworth wrote a letter to Anne Elliott" is grammatically correct because it follows standard English syntax rules for subject-verb agreement and word order. The subject "Captain Wentworth" agrees with the verb "wrote," and the object "a letter" comes after the preposition "to" followed by its indirect object "Anne Elliott."	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	In English, we use subject-auxiliary verb inversion in questions, so the auxiliary verb "was" needs to come before the subject "Alison". The corrected sentence would be: "She asked **was** Alison coming to the party?" -> "She asked **was she** coming to the party?" OR "She asked if Alison was coming to the party."	She asked if Alison was coming to the party.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct. It uses a complex verb tense called the past perfect ("had been") to indicate that Sir Thomas's being offended occurred before another past action. This creates a clear sequence of events in the sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is correctly constructed according to the rules of English syntax. The subject of the sentence is "Fanny," followed by a verb tense indicating past regret ("regretted"), and then the infinitive phrase "having to talk to Aunt Norris" as the object of the regret. This structure accurately conveys the intended meaning of remorse over a required interaction with Aunt Norris.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is correctly constructed according to the rules of syntax in English. It contains a subject ("he"), a verb ("knowing") in its present participle form that functions as an adjective modifying the subject, another verb ("took") that indicates the action performed by the subject, and an object ("a short cut"). Additionally, there is a prepositional phrase ("Knowing the country well,") that provides additional information about the subject. All these elements work together seamlessly to create a grammatical sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "He left the train with somebody else's wallet in his pocket" is grammatically correct as it follows the rules of English syntax. It has a subject ("he"), a verb ("left"), and two prepositional phrases ("with somebody else's wallet" and "in his pocket") that modify the action described by the verb.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Magnus went to Ireland" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object (SVO) word order in English and the verb "went" agrees with its singular subject "Magnus". Additionally, the prepositional phrase "to Ireland" correctly modifies the verb "went", indicating where Magnus traveled to.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence is missing a necessary punctuation mark, specifically a question mark, since it is a question. Without proper punctuation, the meaning and syntax of the sentence can be unclear. In addition, there is no determiner before "book," so we don't know if John sent one book or multiple books. A corrected version could be: "Who did John send the book(s)?", or more naturally, "Who did John send a book to?" or "Who did John give the book to?"	Who did John send the book(s)? However, I would recommend revising the sentence for clarity as shown above.
0	Syntax	In the sentence "The idea dismayed the Prime Minister that the Dome was dull", there is a syntactical error known as a misplaced modifier. Specifically, the word "dismayed" suggests that the idea itself had negative emotions about something, when it's more likely meant to convey that the Prime Minister was dismayed by the idea. To fix this issue, we can rephrase the sentence so that the intended subject ("the Prime Minister") comes before the verb: "The idea that the Dome was dull dismayed the Prime Minister."	The idea that the Dome was dull dismayed the Prime Minister.
0	Syntax	In English, when using the pronouns "he," "she," or "it" after certain verbs such as "come" or "go," we usually add "'s" before adding another verb (in this case, "did"). This construction is called the auxiliary "do" plus lexical verb ("did come") followed by the subject complement ("right"), but there's no need for an extra "he" afterward. So instead of saying "Came right in he did without so much as a knock," it would be grammatically correct to say either "He came right in without so much as a knock" or "Right in he came without so much as a knock."	Right in he came without so much as a knock. OR He came right in without so much as a knock.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Harriet admired Mr Knightley" is grammatically correct because it follows standard English syntax rules for subject-verb-object word order. Additionally, the proper nouns used as subjects and objects ("Harriet" and "Mr. Knightley") have the correct capitalization and spelling, and the verb tense is consistent throughout the sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Other Category	This sentence is grammatically correct but it contains a subjective statement. The word "boring" is a matter of opinion and can vary from person to person. A more objective way to express this thought would be to say "The book is not engaging," as this does not make a value judgment on whether the book is inherently "boring." However, for the purpose of this task, I will assume that the sentence is intended to be a subjective statement and therefore judge its grammaticality only.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Semantics	The sentence is semantically correct as it conveys a clear meaning. It indicates that Ethel wants to ask some questions that might be uncomfortable for the person being asked.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Emma made Harriet some food" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Emma", who is performing the action "made". This action is being done to "Harriet" and involves the object "some food". The syntax follows a standard structure of Subject-Verb-Object, making it easy to understand and grammatically sound.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows standard Subject-Verb-Object word order, uses appropriate verb tense, has clear subject agreement between "window" and "was," and includes proper preposition usage with "with."	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is correctly written according to the rules of syntax in English. It has a subject ("the fugitive"), a verb ("lay") and a complement ("motionless"). Additionally, it contains an adverbial subordinate clause ("in order to avoid discovery") starting with the conjunction "in order".	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject ("the guard") is followed by a verb ("marched") and its direct object ("the prisoners"), indicating transitive action. Additionally, there's a prepositional phrase ("round the yard") modifying the verb.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Frank Churchill crossed the street" is grammatically correct because it follows standard subject-verb-object word order and has proper verb agreement between the singular noun "Frank Churchill" and the past tense verb "crossed". Additionally, the preposition "the" precedes the noun "street", indicating a specific location.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct and well-formed. It follows standard English syntax rules for word order, subject-verb agreement, and tense consistency.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Fiona might be here by 5 o'clock" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Fiona," and the verb tense used ("might be") correctly conveys uncertainty about her arrival time. The prepositional phrase "by 5 o'clock" indicates when she may arrive, using the appropriate preposition before a specific time expression.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The coordinating conjunction "and" should connect two grammatically parallel elements. In the original sentence, there is a mismatch between the two parts being conjoined: "expecting to get the job" is an infinitive verb phrase, while "of the opinion that it is a desirable one" is a prepositional phrase modifying "opinion". A corrected version could be either "I both expect to get the job and think it is desirable," or "I expect to get the job and am of the opinion that it is desirable."	I both expect to get the job and am of the opinion that it is a desirable one.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct but contains a possible contradiction in meaning. The verb "awarded" typically implies receiving something honorable or desirable, while "very upset" suggests dissatisfaction. However, since there is no inherent error in word choice or structure, I will classify this as syntactically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a syntactic error because there is no appropriate conjunction between the two verbs "alienated" and "beating". It would be grammatically correct if it said either "Kim alienated cats and beat his dog," or "Kim alienates cats while beating his dog."	Kim alienated cats and beat his dog.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows standard subject-verb-object word order, and all words are used correctly in context.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence is missing a determiner before the word "Terry". It would be grammatically correct if written as "Which **a** Terry filed papers without reading?" However, even then it would still sound awkward because we don't usually use "which" to refer to people unless they're being specifically identified from a set. A better way to phrase this question could be "Who did Terry file papers without reading?" or "Which documents did Terry fail to read before filing?"	Who did Terry file papers without reading?
0	Syntax	The word "whiskey" should be spelled as "whisky" when referring to the alcoholic beverage produced in Scotland, Ireland, Canada, and Japan. It can be spelled as "whiskey" when referring to the American or Irish versions. However, it is more common to see it spelled without the e ("whisky") in most countries outside of America. In this case, since no location has been specified for where the whisk(e)y will be purchased from, either spelling could technically be used; but to avoid confusion, it would be best to use the spelling preferred by the majority of English speakers worldwide, i.e., "whisky". Therefore, the original sentence contains a minor error related to vocabulary choice within the context of international English conventions.	I want to try and buy some whisky.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a mistake in its verb tense agreement. The present continuous tense ("goes") does not agree with the base form of the verb in the infinitive phrase ("buying"). It should be either "She goes and buys some whiskey" or "She is going and buying some whiskey".	She is going and buying some whiskey.
0	Syntax	In English, when we have multiple nouns together as subjects of a verb, we need to make sure each noun agrees with the verb in number. Here, 'Kim' and 'Terry' are two separate individuals, so they require a plural verb. The correct form of the verb for them would be 'are', not 'is'. Therefore, the correct version of the sentence should read: "Kim and Terry are happy." So, the original sentence has incorrect syntax because it uses the singular form 'is' instead of the plural form 'are' after the coordinated subject 'Kim and Terry'.	Kim and Terry are happy.
1	Syntax	The sentence is correctly written in terms of syntax as it follows the rules for word order and structure in English. Each clause has a subject ("Kim", "a dollar"), verb ("gave"), and object ("Bobbie" and "Jean"). Also, there is no misplaced modifier or ambiguity.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is structurally well-formed and all the words have been used correctly. It contains multiple clauses joined by conjunctions ("and" and "before"), but they are arranged properly and do not cause any confusion.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The first clause of the sentence contains a misplaced modifier. The phrase "on your desk" should be next to "put," indicating that the action of putting takes place on the desk. Therefore, the corrected clause would read, "[This girl in the red coat] puts a picture of Bill on your desk before tomorrow." However, since there are two clauses referring to the same event, we can simplify the entire sentence as follows: "Put a picture of Bill on your desk; another one will also be placed there by this girl in the red coat before tomorrow." This revised version has parallel structure and eliminates redundancy.	Put a picture of Bill on your desk; another one will also be placed there by this girl in the red coat before tomorrow.
0	Syntax	The possessive form "your" should be used instead of the objective form "you" after "on". Additionally, it would sound more natural to say "this girl will put a picture of Bill on your desk by tomorrow", rather than "before tomorrow".	"Picture of Bill, this girl in the red coat will put a picture of Bill on your desk by tomorrow."
1	Syntax	The sentence is correctly constructed according to the rules of syntax in English. Each word has been used appropriately and placed in the right order.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Semantics	The word "deadly" here means causing death or having the power to cause death. It seems that it is used incorrectly in the context because people do not usually become a cause of death when they get scared of something. Instead, I think the intended meaning is very scared or extremely frightened. In this case, we can use the word "terribly" or "extremely". So, the corrected version would be: "John became terribly/extremely afraid of flying."	John became terribly/extremely afraid of flying.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct, as it follows standard subject-verb-complement structure, where "what John promised" serves as the subject, "is" as the linking verb, and "to be gentle" as the complement indicating what John promised.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a missing article before the word "books". In English, we need to use either "a" or "an" when referring to singular nouns for the first time in a sentence. Also, it would be better to place a question mark at the end of the sentence instead of inside the quotation marks. A corrected version could read as follows: "Henri wants to buy which book about cooking?" or "Henri wants to buy which cookbooks?".	"Henri wants to buy which cookbook(s)?", depending on whether he's looking for just one specific title or multiple titles related to cooking.
0	Syntax	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in this sentence. The plural subject "I" requires a plural verb, but "will fix" is singular. It should be "I will fix" or "we will fix," depending on whether the speaker intends to include themselves in the action.	The sentence should read: "I will fix the computer for Carol."
1	Syntax	The sentence "Smith loaned a valuable collection of manuscripts to the library" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure for an active voice sentence: subject + verb + object. In this case, the subject is "Smith," the verb is "loaned," and the object is "a valuable collection of manuscripts." Additionally, the prepositional phrase "to the library" modifies the verb by specifying where the action occurred.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically correct as it follows the standard Subject-Verb-Object structure in English (Mary - cuts - the paper), where each element agrees in number with the others.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The first part of the sentence, "It was from six to nine," is a grammatically correct construction used to describe the time when something happened. However, connecting two complete clauses with only a conjunction such as 'or' can be confusing because it creates a compound predicate rather than a coordinating clause structure. To make the meaning clearer and improve grammaticality, we need to revise the second half of the sentence slightly by adding another subject-verb pair or using a pronoun for cohesion. For instance, if referring back to the same subject, we could say, "It was from six to nine or it took place during those hours" or alternatively, "It was from six to nine or the event took place then".	It was from six to nine or the event took place then.
1	Syntax	The sentence is correctly written in terms of syntax as it follows the rules for word order and structure in English.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	In standard English, it is generally required that subject-verb agreement be maintained within a clause. In this case, "the soup" is singular and requires a singular verb form such as "cooks," but since there are two actions being described ("cooks" and "thickens"), two separate clauses would typically be used, each with its own subject and verb. A coordinating conjunction such as "and" could then be added to connect the two clauses. For example: "The soup cooks and thickens."	The soup cooks and thickens.
1	Syntax	The sentence "I gave money to the charity" is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple sentence structure: subject ("I") + auxiliary verb ("gave") + object ("money") + preposition ("to") + object of the preposition ("the charity"). All elements are in their proper place and there are no grammatical errors.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Other Category	The sentence "John asked" is grammatically correct but it is incomplete and lacks context. A complete sentence requires a subject and a predicate. In this case, we have only been given the subject ("John"). We need more information about what John did or what he asked for the sentence to be considered semantically complete.	The sentence is already correct, but it would be improved by adding additional context. For example: "John asked a question during class today."
0	Syntax	The error in this sentence is related to syntax, specifically word order. In the subject of the sentence ("I"), followed by a verb ("saw"). However, there is no direct object immediately following the verb as we would expect. Instead, there is an adverbial clause ("even the student") interrupting the flow of the sentence. This can be corrected by moving "the student" so that it directly follows "saw," creating a clearer syntactic structure for the sentence.	I saw the student even.
0	Syntax	The sentence "John whispered Mary left" is syntactically incorrect because it lacks a main verb for the subject "Mary". A proper complete sentence requires both a subject and a predicate, but here "Mary" does not have its own action or state described by a verb. It's unclear what "Mary left" refers to in relation to "John whispered", making the meaning ambiguous.	Either combine them into a single clause ("John whispered that Mary had left") or separate them as two independent clauses connected appropriately ("John whispered; Mary had left").
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a subjunctive mood error. In English, when we express doubt about a situation that has not yet occurred, we use the base form of the verb after "wonder" instead of a subject-verb agreement. Therefore, the correct sentence would be "Mary wonders if Bill will come."	Mary wonders if Bill will come.
0	Syntax	The issue with this sentence lies in its syntax, specifically in the verb agreement rule. In English, a subject and its verb must agree in number; therefore, we need to use a singular form of the verb when the subject is singular. In this case, 'Sophie' is a single person, so the verb should be in its base form ('will') instead of the third-person singular ('will**s**'). Therefore, the correct form would be 'Sophie will **go** to the theater.'	Sophie will go to the theater.
1	Syntax	The sentence "John finished the cake and drank the lemonade" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules for subject-verb agreement, word order, and punctuation in English syntax. It consists of two independent clauses ("John finished the cake" and "drank the lemonade") connected by a coordinating conjunction ("and"). Each clause contains a noun phrase ("John", "the cake", "the lemonade") followed by a verb phrase ("finished", "drank"), making the structure clear and easy to understand.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in this sentence. In English, singular subjects require a singular verb form. Here, the plural noun "herself" is being used as the subject but it does not agree with the singular verb "likes". To fix this error, we could change the pronoun to its singular form "she", making the corrected sentence read "She likes Mary's mother."	She likes Mary's mother.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject ("each of the boys") is followed by a verb ("fought"), and there is a proper use of prepositions ("with" and "of"). Additionally, the pronouns used match their antecedents in number and gender.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The reflexive pronoun used here should be "herself" instead of "himself". So the corrected sentence would read as follows: "John's mother likes herself."	The sentence should be: "John's mother likes herself."
0	Syntax	The subject of the sentence "Mary" is female, but the reflexive pronoun used is "himself," which refers to a male entity. A more grammatically correct version would be "Mary revealed herself to John."	Mary revealed herself to John.
1	Syntax	The reflexive pronoun "himself" agrees in number with its antecedent "Bill," so there is no syntactic error in this sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically correct because it follows the rules for word order and structure in English. It contains a dependent clause ("that they criticized themselves") and an independent clause ("John heard"), both of which are grammatically sound.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is correctly constructed syntactically. It has a subject ("Mary"), a verb ("thinks") and an object clause ("she is smart"). All elements agree in number and person.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Henry found that Bill is sad" is grammatically correct. It consists of a main clause "Henry found" and a subordinate clause "that Bill is sad". Both clauses have a subject ("Henry", "Bill") and a predicate verb ("found", "is"). The tense is consistent within each clause.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The verb "considers" requires a clause as its complement, but here it is followed by a noun phrase ("himself proud of Mary"). A correct version would be "John considers himself to be proud of Mary", where "to be proud of Mary" forms a clause. Alternatively, we could say "John is proud of Mary".	John considers himself to be proud of Mary.
0	Syntax	The subject-verb agreement rule states that singular subjects require a singular verb, while plural subjects require a plural verb. In this case, the subject "you" is singular, but the verb form used, "are," is plural. This error can be corrected by changing the verb form to match the subject, as shown below.	The sentence should read "You should sit before it." if referring to something specific, or simply "You should sit first." if there's no need for additional context.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct and well-formed. There are no errors in subject-verb agreement, word order, or tense usage.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The problem with this sentence lies in its syntax, specifically the verb agreement between the subject and the predicate. In the original sentence, "everyone" serves as a singular subject, but it's followed by the plural form of the verb ("hopes"). To fix the issue, we need to ensure that the verb matches the number of the subject.	The corrected sentence would be: "Everyone hopes that everyone else will sleep." Here, I added "that" and "else" to clarify the meaning and maintain proper syntactic structure.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Everyone hopes that he will sleep" is grammatically correct. The subject "everyone" is a singular noun, so it requires a singular pronoun later in the sentence. In this case, "he" is used as the object of the clause "that he will sleep," which is grammatically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a repetition error in the subject noun phrase. The first instance of "Churchill" refers to the person who did the remembering, while the second instance of "Churchill" refers to the person who gave the speech. However, using the same name twice for two different referents in the same clause can lead to confusion. It would be clearer if we used two different words or phrases to distinguish between them. For example, we could say "Only Winston Churchill remembered *his own* 'Blood, Sweat and Tears' speech". This way, it is clear that there are two separate entities being referred to - the speaker ("Winston Churchill") and the speech he made ("the Blood, Sweat and Tears speech"). Alternatively, we could use pronouns to avoid repeating the proper noun, as in "*He* was the only one who remembered his giving the Blood, Sweat and Tears speech". Either way, by distinguishing between the two instances of "Churchill", the syntax becomes less ambiguous and easier to parse.	Only Winston Churchill remembered his own 'Blood, Sweat and Tears' speech.
0	Syntax	The error in this sentence lies in subject-verb agreement. In this case, "promise" requires a third person singular form ("promises") because its subject "John" is singular. Additionally, there is an incorrect pronoun reference; "himself" should refer back to "Mary," but it actually refers to "John." A correct version could be: "John promises Mary he will shave himself."	John promises Mary he will shave himself.
1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically correct because it follows the rules for word order and structure in English. It contains a subject ("John"), a verb ("convinced"), and an object ("Bill") in the first clause, followed by another subject ("Mary") and a predicate ("should sleep") in the second clause. All necessary elements are present and arranged correctly, making the sentence grammatically sound.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a coordinating conjunction ("while") joining two independent clauses without proper punctuation. A comma before "you" would make it grammatically correct.	I saw Bill, while you did so, Mary.
0	Syntax	The subject-verb agreement rule has been violated in this sentence. In the clause "Bill was give," the verb "was" does not agree with its plural subject "Bill". A singular subject requires a singular verb form, so it should be either "gave" if we want to keep the past tense ("What Mary did, Bill gave a book") or present perfect ("What Mary has done, Bill has given a book").	The corrected version could be "What Mary did was give a book" or even better as two separate sentences, such as "Mary did something. She gave Bill a book."
0	Syntax	In English, a verb must agree with its subject in number. Here, the subject "bears" is plural while the verb "sniffed" is singular, which creates a mismatch. This error can be corrected by changing the verb form to match the subject's number.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct, as it follows standard subject-verb-object word order and contains a clear subject ("to steal talismans"), verb ("is"), and object ("from witches"). Additionally, the article "the" is appropriately omitted before an abstract concept such as "stealing talismans."	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The verb "demonize" requires a direct object to complete its meaning, but no direct object is provided in the sentence. A corrected version could be "Anson demonized the policy," assuming there's a policy that Anson has criticized intensely.	Anson demonized the policy.
0	Syntax	The verb "kick" requires a singular object when used reflexively ("kick yourself"), but here it is being used with a plural reflexive pronoun ("yourselves"). This is incorrect because multiple people cannot kick themselves simultaneously as a single unit; each person must kick himself or herself individually. To make the sentence grammatically correct while preserving its original meaning, we can say "Each of you kicked yourselves," since this implies multiple individuals acting independently rather than collectively. However, if we want to express the idea that they acted collectively, then the proper expression would be "you all kicked yourselves" or simply "you kicked."	Either "Each of you kicked yourselves," "You all kicked yourselves," or "You kicked."
0	Syntax	This sentence contains a misplaced relative clause. A relative clause headed by "that" must immediately follow its antecedent noun phrase. In this case, the intended antecedent is "the book," but it is separated from the relative clause by another noun phrase ("I"). To fix the issue, we can rephrase the sentence as follows: "The book that I said I'd never read." Alternatively, we could use a pronoun instead of repeating "the book": "I said I'd never read that book."	The book that I said I'd never read.
0	Syntax	The verb "demonize" requires a direct object, but there is no clear noun being acted upon in this sentence. Additionally, the adverb "up" does not make sense in this context. A more appropriate way to structure this sentence would be "Anson demonized the Khyber Pass."	Anson demonized the Khyber Pass.
0	Syntax	The negation "not" is incorrectly placed before "true". Instead, it should come after "it is", making the correct form "It is not true that I might be going to the party."	It is not true that I might be going to the party.
0	Syntax	The sentence "Kick you!" is a sentence fragment because it lacks a subject and a complete predicate. A more grammatically correct version would be "Someone is kicking you" or simply "He kicks you," depending on context.	The sentence is not already correct; a possible correction could be "He kicks you."
1	Syntax	The sentence "Jason persuaded the doctor to treat Medea" is syntactically correct because it follows the rules for word order and structure in English. It contains a subject ("Jason"), a verb ("persuaded"), and two objects ("the doctor" and "Medea"). Additionally, there is a dependent clause "to treat Medea," which functions as the direct object of the main clause.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in this sentence. In the present tense, third person singular subjects require a verb ending in -s or -es. Therefore, "did" should be changed to "does," resulting in the corrected version: "Who does she get an accurate description of?"	Who does she get an accurate description of?
1	Syntax	In this sentence, there is no clear syntactic mistake. All words are grammatically correct and used appropriately in their respective roles within the structure of the sentence. Therefore, it appears to be a correctly constructed sentence from a syntax perspective.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically incomplete as it lacks a direct object for the verb "impose". A more complete version would be something like "The government's imposition of a fine on companies violating environmental regulations" where "on companies violating environmental regulations" serves as the direct object.	The sentence could be made correct by adding a direct object such as "The government's imposition of a fine on companies violating environmental regulations."
0	The sentence is already correct.	The sentence "Did Athena help us?" is grammatically correct and can be used in appropriate contexts. It follows standard English syntax rules for forming a question about past actions involving a specific subject ("Athena") and auxiliary verb ("did"). Additionally, there are no semantic errors, as it conveys a clear meaning. Furthermore, morphologically, all words are correctly inflected based on their intended function within the sentence structure. Therefore, I would classify this under "Other Category" because there are no issues related to syntax, semantics, or morphology present in the sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically correct as it follows the standard structure of a simple sentence, i.e., Subject-Verb-Object (SVO): "you" (subject), "wanted" (verb), "to meet the man I saw" (object). Additionally, all the words used in the sentence are grammatically correct, and they agree in number and tense.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence "Anson demonized David every day" is grammatically incorrect because it lacks a proper determinier for the noun "day". It would be more appropriate to say "every day", without attaching it directly to "David". Additionally, if we want to emphasize that something happened on each individual day, we can use "each day" instead.	The corrected sentence could either be "Anson demonized David every day" or "Anson demonized David each day," depending on what exactly is meant by "every day".
0	Syntax	The verb "is" should be changed to "there is" for subject-verb agreement. Additionally, the word "a" before "Radio 4" should be removed since it's uncountable and doesn't require an article.	There is a program about Euripides on Radio 4 tonight.
1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically well-formed as it follows the standard structure of a simple declarative sentence, i.e., subject ("Medea") + auxiliary verb ("denied") + predicate ("poisoning the phoenix"). All elements in the sentence agree in number and tense, making it grammatically sound.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "The elixir was hidden in a hole in the ground" is grammatically correct. It follows the standard Subject-Verb-Object word order in English, where "The elixir" is the subject, "was" is the linking verb, and "hidden in a hole in the ground" is the object complement describing the location of the elixir. Additionally, all words are used correctly in their intended meanings, and there are no grammatical errors such as incorrect tense, agreement issues, or missing punctuation marks. Therefore, the sentence's syntax is flawless.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence is missing a preposition between "danced" and "Trade". It is unclear what Anson is doing at trade without additional context. A possible correction could be "Extremely frantatically, Anson danced at the trade fair."	The sentence is not correct as it stands. See explanation for suggested correction.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a misplaced word ("who") which interrupts the flow of the question. A more appropriate way to structure this sentence would be to ask "What did Medea give to whom?" if the intention is to inquire about both the recipient and object of Medea's actions. Alternatively, if seeking clarification on only one aspect of the action, such as what she gave, the sentence could simply read "What did Medea give?"	What did Medea give? OR What did Medea give to whom?
1	Correct as Given	The sentence "It's Anson that I like" is grammatically correct and free from any spelling errors. Therefore, it does not require any correction.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The verb "tried" needs to be followed by a verb in the infinitive form without "to". Therefore, the correct sentence would be "Medea tried **to** poison the nurse's children", or "Medea attempted nursing her children with poison", depending on what exactly is meant.	The sentence should either be "Medea tried to poison the nurse's children", or "Medea attempted nursing her children with poison".
0	Syntax	The verb tense does not agree in this sentence. It should be either "I feel that I knew you" or "I felt that I know you". Since both options change the meaning of the sentence slightly, it's possible that neither option correctly conveys what the speaker intended to say. In such cases, it may be best to rephrase the sentence entirely.	The sentence could be rephrased as "I felt that I was familiar with you", for example, depending on what the speaker means.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a double subject ("he" and "can"), which results in incorrect syntax. In order for the sentence to be grammatically correct, we need to use either "will" or "can," but not both together. Here's how the corrected version would look like using each word individually: * With "will": He will do it. * With "can": Can he do it?	Can he do it?
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a syntactic error because there is no proper subject-verb agreement. In this case, "I" is the subject and it requires a verb in past tense such as "ate". However, "that she was happy" is a dependent clause acting as the object of the sentence but has its own subject ("she") and predicate ("was happy"). A corrected version would be: "I knew that she was happy."	I knew that she was happy.
1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically correct because it follows the rules for word order and structure in English. The subject ("Anson") is followed by a verb ("believed"), and then we have a clause ("himself to be handsome") that functions as the direct object of the verb. This type of construction where the subject refers back to itself is called reflexive, and it's grammatically valid in English.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows standard English syntax rules for forming a simple sentence. It contains a subject ("we") and a verb ("arrived"), and specifies when the action occurred using an adverbial clause ("about six o'clock").	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The verb tense in this sentence is incorrect. "Gilgamesh is having fought" is a present perfect progressive tense combined with a past participle form of the verb. This results in a confusing and grammatically incorrect construction. It would be better to use either the simple past ("Gilgamesh fought the dragon") if the action occurred in the past or the present perfect ("Gilgamesh has fought the dragon") if the speaker wants to emphasize that the action happened at an unspecified time before now but still has relevance to the current moment.	The corrected sentence could be either "Gilgamesh fought the dragon," indicating a completed past action, or "Gilgamesh has fought the dragon," indicating a recent past action that has some bearing on the present situation.
0	Syntax	The reflexive pronoun "himself" should be used as the object of a verb or preposition and refer back to the subject of the clause. In this case, the subject of the embedded clause "that himself was happy" is "he", so it should be "He thought that he was happy". Alternatively, if Anson is referring to someone else who is both the subject of the main clause and the object of the embedded clause, then we can say something like "Anson thought that Mary thought highly of herself".	He thought that he was happy.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Fortunately Hermione passed biology" is grammatically correct, but it is missing a required word for proper meaning. In this case, we need to know what action happened fortuitously - did she pass the class, or just some test? Therefore, I would recommend adding either 'the exam' or 'her class' after 'biology'. However, since there is no clear grammatical error, I will still mark it as correct in terms of syntax.	The sentence is almost correct; consider revising to "Fortunately Hermione passed her biology class" or "Fortunately Hermione passed the biology exam."
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a conjunction "but" that connects two phrases without a clear main verb for the second phrase. A possible correction could be "I might not go to the party; instead, I will wash my hair."	The sentence I provided earlier ("I might not go to the party; instead, I will wash my hair.") is grammatically correct.
0	Syntax	The reflexive pronoun used here should be "me" instead of "myself". This is because when using a verb such as 'think' followed by 'that', we use the objective form of the pronoun after 'that'. Therefore, it should be "he liked me", not "he liked himself".	The corrected sentence is "I thought he liked me."
1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically well-formed as it follows the standard structure of a simple sentence - Subject + Verb + Object. In this case, 'the butler' serves as the subject, 'sent' as the verb, and 'the poison' as the object. Moreover, there are no grammatical errors such as incorrect word order, agreement issues between subjects and verbs, etc.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The issue with this sentence lies in its redundancy and overuse of conjunctions indicating appearance rather than fact. A more straightforward way to express this idea would be: "Jason seems sick." Or if there's uncertainty about his condition: "Jason might be sick."	Jason seems sick.
0	Syntax	The question lacks a proper subject-verb agreement as it has two verbs ("did" and "see") but only one possible plural subject ("who"). To fix this issue, we need to rephrase the question by making either "what" or "who" the subject of both verds, or dividing the question into two separate questions with appropriate subjects for each verb.	Either "What did you see?" or "Who asked what?" would be grammatically correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "We linguists love to argue" is grammatically correct. It follows the standard subject-verb-object word order in English.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence "He can will go" is grammatically incorrect because it contains a redundancy error. The modal verb "can" already implies ability, so there's no need to use "will," which expresses future tense. Therefore, the correct form would be either "He can go" or "He will go", but not both together.	The sentence should be "He can go" or "He will go".
0	Syntax	The sentence is missing a question mark at the end, making it grammatically incorrect. Additionally, there is no auxiliary verb before "fierce" to form a proper interrogative sentence. A possible correction could be "How fierce was the battle?" or "How fierce is the battle?" depending on the intended meaning.	How fierce was the battle? Or, alternatively: How fierce is the battle?
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a misplaced relative pronoun "which". It's unclear what "which" refers to - the king or the city. To fix it, we need to clarify the antecedent for each relative pronoun by reordering the clauses or adding more context.	You asked me which city the king had invaded. OR Which king did you ask about as having invaded a city?
0	Syntax	The subject of the sentence "it" does not agree with its predicate "some disgruntled old pigs". Moreover, it is better to use a plural pronoun such as "they" instead of "it", since "pigs" is a plural noun. Also, there's no need for commas around "that humans love to eat," because it's essential information needed to identify which pigs are being referred to.	They are some disgruntled old pigs in those ditches that humans love to eat.
0	Syntax	In the sentence "That banana is eating the monkey," there is a subject-verb agreement error. The subject "that banana" is singular, but the verb "is eating" is conjugated for plural subjects. The correct form would be "is eats" if we want to keep the present tense, or "was eating" if we want to change it to past tense. However, even then, anthropomorphizing animals in such a way does not make logical sense; therefore, I will assume that the intended meaning is that the monkey is eating the banana.	The monkey is eating that banana.
0	Syntax	The sentence "Burn them!" is a fragment because it lacks a main verb and a subject, making it syntactically incomplete. A complete sentence requires both a subject and a predicate (a verb), but this sentence only contains a verb without any accompanying subject.	The sentence is not correct. Here's a corrected version: "Burn them!" should be "Please burn them." or "You should burn them." or some other variation that includes a clear subject and predicate.
0	Other Category	The word "omnipotent" means all-powerful, so it implies that a being has immense power but does not necessarily affect the grammaticality of the sentence. However, some people may find the use of such terminology unusual when referring to Greek gods, as they do not typically possess these qualities in mythology. Nonetheless, from a strict grammar perspective, there's no error.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Semantics	The sentence "Agamemnon seems to be a maniac" is grammatically correct but the choice of word "maniac" might not be accurate depending on the intended meaning. A maniac usually refers to someone who has an extreme obsession or desire, often in a way that is harmful or disruptive. It can also refer to someone who suffers from a severe form of mental illness characterized by irrational behavior and sometimes violence. Without additional context, it's unclear whether this is the intended meaning. Alternative words such as "angry," "aggressive," or "impulsive" could be more appropriate based on the desired connotation.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Will Anson come to the party?" is grammatically correct. It follows the standard structure of a question in English, where the auxiliary verb "will" comes before the subject "Anson".	The sentence is already correct.
1	Semantics	The sentence is semantically correct as it conveys a clear meaning and there are no logical errors. It is asking about the identity of the person whom Medea had poisoned.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The subject-auxiliary inversion needed for a question has been applied incorrectly here. It should be "Could I inquire when we can leave?" instead. In your example, it seems as though there is only one person leaving, so using "we" might also cause confusion if that's not what was intended.	Could I inquire when we can leave?
0	Syntax	The sentence is missing a direct object. Without it, we don't know what they kicked. For example, "They kicked the ball" would be grammatically correct.	The sentence is not correct. A possible correction could be: They kicked the ball.
0	Syntax	In this sentence, the verb "is" does not agree with its subject "monkey". Instead, it looks like a form of the verb "to be" used for present continuous tense ("is eating"). However, there's no -ing form after "is", so we need to replace "is" with the simple present tense third person singular form "eats": "The monkey eats the banana".	The monkey eats the banana.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a subject-verb agreement error. The verb "could" does not agree with its singular subject "I". It should be "I could swim", not "I would like to could swim".	I would like to swim.
0	Syntax	The sentence "I kicked myself" is grammatically correct but its meaning can be unclear without additional context. In general, it implies that the speaker did something regretful and is expressing self-reproach for their action. However, if taken literally, it could imply physical harm towards oneself, so caution must be used when interpreting or using this phrase.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	In the sentence "The bookcase ran," the word "ran" does not make sense when used with "bookcase." A bookcase cannot run because it is an inanimate object. This error is a syntax error because it violates our understanding of how words can be combined to form meaningful phrases and sentences.	The bookcase stood in the corner.
1	Syntax	The sentence "I shaved myself" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure in English and the verb "shaved" agrees with its singular subject "I". Additionally, the reflexive pronoun "myself" is correctly used as the object of the sentence, referring back to the subject "I".	The sentence is already correct.
0	Morphology	The word "musclebound" is written as two words instead of one, so it is incorrect. Additionally, there is no article ("a", "an", or "the") before "musclebound".	The sentence should be either "Anson became muscle-bound." or "Anson became a musclebound person.", depending on context.
