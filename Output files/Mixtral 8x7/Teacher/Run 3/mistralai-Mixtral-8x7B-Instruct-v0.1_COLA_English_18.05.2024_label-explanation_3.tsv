1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "the sailors," which is a plural noun. The verb "rode" agrees with the plural subject because it is the past tense of the irregular verb "ride." In this context, "rode" means to travel on or through by using wind power, so it makes sense with the subject. The prepositional phrase "clear of the rocks" describes where the sailors traveled. Therefore, there are no grammatical errors in this sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. Here's a breakdown of why that is so: - The subject of the sentence is "the weights," which is plural. Therefore, the verb must also be plural to agree with the subject. In this case, "made" is the past tense of "make," which can be used as both singular and plural verbs, depending on context. However, when the subject is plural, it functions as a plural verb (e.g., "The dogs bark"). So, "made" is functioning correctly here as a plural verb. - The direct object of the sentence is "rope." It follows the verb and receives the action of the verb. There is nothing incorrect about using "rope" as a direct object. - "stretch" is the main verb in the sentence, indicating what the subject ("weights") did to the direct object ("rope"). - Prepositions indicate relationships between other words or phrases in a sentence. "Over" indicates the spatial relationship between "stretch" and "pulley". - Finally, "pulley" is the indirect object because it shows where the action occurred. Again, there is nothing wrong with using "pulley" in this way. Therefore, I would rate this sentence as grammatically correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "The mechanical doll" serves as the subject of the sentence, which is a noun phrase referring to a specific type of doll. * "wriggled" is the verb that describes the action performed by the subject. It agrees with the singular subject in number and tense (past tense). * "itself" is a reflexive pronoun that refers back to the subject of the sentence, indicating that the doll performs the action on itself. Reflexive pronouns modify verbs or adjectives when the subject and object refer to the same entity. In this case, it indicates that the doll freed itself from something without any external help. * "loose" functions as an adverb modifying the verb "wriggled," describing how the action was performed. Adverbs often end in "-ly", but there are irregular adverbs such as "soon," "fast," and "late." "Loose" can be used as an adverb to mean "in a relaxed way" or "without restraint," so it fits well in this context.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The past perfect tense ("had eaten") is used correctly to indicate that the action of eating occurred before another past time event (implied as wanting). Additionally, the conditional clause "you would want" is properly constructed to express a hypothetical situation.
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect because of the word order in the second clause. A more appropriate way to phrase it would be "The less you want, the more you eat." In its current form, the sentence suggests that as someone eats more, they desire less, which goes against typical human behavior and requires additional context for clarity.
0	This sentence is grammatically incorrect because of the word order in the first part of the sentence. A corrected version could be: "The less you want, the more you will eat." or "The less you eat, the more you want (to lose weight)." In both cases, the subject ("you") comes before the verb ("want"/"eat").
0	The sentence contains a grammatical error known as a split infinitive. In traditional English grammar, it's considered incorrect to split an infinitive verb (in this case, "to eat" and "to pay") with another word, especially an adverb such as "more." A corrected version of the sentence would be: "I demand that the more John eats, the more he pays."
0	This sentence needs a comma after "Dead" to separate two independent clauses that are connected by the coordinating conjunction "she." The corrected sentence would be: "Mary listens to the Grateful Dead, and she gets depressed." Alternatively, if we want to express cause-effect relationship between these two actions (i.e., listening to music causes depression), it's better to use subordinating conjunction such as "because," which eliminates the need for a comma: "Because Mary listens to the Grateful Dead, she gets depressed."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. Here's a breakdown of its structure: * The subject of the sentence is "Mary," which is modified by the adverb "angrier." * There are two actions being described here - getting angry (intransitive verb) and looking at pictures (transitive verb). These verbs are connected using the conjunction "and" to show cause-effect relationship between them. * The second action is further qualified by the phrase "the more...at pictures," which functions as an adverbial clause modifying the verb "looked." This type of construction is called a correlative construction where one quantity or degree influences another. In this case, the greater Mary's anger, the more time she spent looking at pictures.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "the higher stakes," which is modified by a comparative clause ("the higher than they were before"). The verb is "are," which agrees with its singular subject. The object of the preposition "of" is "his expectations." Overall, the syntax and word choice are appropriate for standard written English.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("the more Fred is obnoxious"), a verb ("should pay"), and an object ("to him"). Additionally, it uses the comparative form of an adjective correctly in a correlative construction, which indicates that the writer understands how comparatives work in English grammar. Overall, I would say that this sentence demonstrates a strong command of standard written English.
1	The sentence "John was lots more obnoxious than Fred" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "John" is a proper noun referring to someone named John, which is used correctly as the subject of the sentence. * "was" is an auxiliary verb that indicates past tense, which agrees with the subject "John." * "lots more obnoxious" is a comparative phrase that modifies the adjective "obnoxious," indicating that John has a greater degree of obnoxiousness compared to Fred. * "than" introduces the second part of the comparison. * "Fred" is another proper noun that refers to someone named Fred, who is being compared to John. Overall, the sentence uses standard English grammar rules and contains no errors.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It follows a clear subject-verb-object structure ("you" as the subject, "give" as the verb, and "beer to people" and "people get sick" as the objects). Additionally, it uses proper tense (present simple) and word order.
0	This sentence contains a common error known as "mixed construction." Specifically, it mixes two different constructions for comparing things: one using "more" (as in "the more he smokes") and another using "the" plus an adjective ("she hates him"). To fix this error, we could rephrase the sentence to say either "The more Bill smokes, the more she hates him," or "The greater amount that Bill smokes, the more she hates him."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. There are no spelling errors or punctuation mistakes, and the word order follows standard English syntax rules. Additionally, the subject ("the more pictures of him that appear in the news") and predicate ("the more embarrassed John becomes") are both logically consistent and coherent. Therefore, I would rate this sentence as 1, indicating that it is a correctly written English sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "every senator," which is plural. The verb that agrees with a plural subject should also be plural, so "seems" is changed to "see" to make it agree with the subject. However, in informal speech or writing, we often use singular verbs with plural subjects, especially when using words such as "each," "every," and "no." Therefore, this sentence is acceptable in informal contexts but would be incorrect in formal writing.
0	The sentence contains a grammatical error known as a dangling modifier. The phrase "because he likes" modifies the subject of the sentence, which is "John". However, the clause that follows doesn't specify who or what John likes. A corrected version might be: "John visits Sally because he likes her." Alternatively, if we want to maintain the original meaning without specifying whom John likes, we could say: "John visits Sally, liking her company."
1	The sentence "Marianne did not leave" is grammatically correct. It consists of a subject ("Marianne"), an auxiliary verb ("did"), a negation ("not"), and a main verb in past tense form ("leave"). This structure correctly expresses the negative past action performed by the subject.
1	The sentence "He could not have been working" is grammatically correct. It is in the past perfect continuous tense, which describes an action that started and finished in the past. In this case, it expresses a negative situation where the subject was unlikely to be performing an ongoing activity.
0	The sentence contains a double negative ("can not" and "not"), which creates confusion and makes the sentence incorrect. The correct form would be either "He cannot have been working" or "He couldn't have been working." Double negatives often create a positive meaning when used together; however, they do not fit grammatically within formal written or spoken English.
1	The sentence "You will believe Bob" is grammatically correct. It consists of a subject ("you"), an auxiliary verb ("will"), and a main verb ("believe") that agrees with the subject in number. There are no spelling errors or awkward phrasings to correct. Therefore, I am returning 1 for this input string.
1	The sentence "John has not kissed Mary" is grammatically correct. It follows the standard structure of a sentence with a subject ("John"), an auxiliary verb ("has"), an adverb ("not"), and an object ("Mary"). Additionally, the verb tense is consistent throughout the sentence, using present perfect to indicate that something happened in the past but is still relevant now. There are no spelling or punctuation errors, making it a correctly written English sentence.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It uses the past perfect tense ("had I seen") to describe an action completed before another past action or time. This tense is formed using the auxiliary verb "have" (in this case, its past form "had") together with the past participle of the main verb ("seen"). Additionally, the negative adverb "never" is used appropriately to emphasize that the speaker has never seen such a place before.
0	The pronoun "it" is incorrectly placed in the sentence. It should be "Mickey looked up at it." or "Mickey looked it up." depending on what Mickey is looking up. In the original sentence, "up it" creates a confusion for the reader about where Mickey's gaze is directed.
1	The sentence "There tended to be a lot of discussion" is grammatically correct. The verb tense "tended to be" indicates that the action occurred frequently or was typical in the past, which matches the use of the simple past tense in the rest of the sentence ("was"). Additionally, there are no apparent errors in subject-verb agreement, word choice, or syntax.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "John," who is attempting (signified by "tried") to accomplish something, namely, becoming ("be") a good boy. There are no spelling errors or awkward phrasings that would detract from the clarity of meaning.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence, "John," is a proper noun that refers to a person's name. The verb "is" agrees with the singular subject, indicating present tense. Finally, the adjective "eager" modifies the subject by describing his state of mind or readiness. Therefore, there are no grammatical errors in this sentence.
1	The sentence "We want John to win" is grammatically correct. It consists of a subject ("we") and a clause expressing desire ("want" + infinitive verb "to win"). The pronoun "John" refers clearly to one person, making it a singular noun that agrees with the plural subject through the use of the auxiliary verb "want." No grammatical errors or awkward phrasings can be found here.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("the box"), a verb ("contained"), and an object ("the ball"). Additionally, it includes clear prepositional phrases that modify the objects they describe ("from the tree"). All of the words are spelled correctly and all punctuation marks are used appropriately.
0	The verb "escape" requires a subject that can perform the action of escaping, rather than being acted upon. In addition, the preposition used to describe movement away from something is typically "from," not "by." A more appropriate way to phrase the sentence would be "Gas escaped from the tube."
1	The sentence "Water bubbled up out of the kettle" is grammatically correct. Here's a breakdown of why it works: * "Water" is a singular noun that serves as the subject of the sentence. It agrees with the verb "bubbled." * "Bubbled" is the past tense of the intransitive verb "to bubble," which means to form or rise in bubbles. This verb describes what the water did. * "Up" functions as an adverb modifying how the water bubbled—it rose vertically from its source. * "Out" also acts as an adverb describing where the action occurred—the water came out of something else (namely, the kettle). * Finally, "of the kettle" shows possession; the kettle owns whatever comes out of it. In this case, it refers to the location where the water originated before it started bubbling upward. Overall, each word has a clear function within the sentence, making for proper grammar and syntax.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple subject ("the tub") and a predicate verb ("leaked"), followed by the direct object ("water"). There are no grammatical errors or awkward phrasing that would make it difficult for a native speaker to understand. Therefore, I would rate this sentence as being grammatically correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It uses the passive voice ("was filled") correctly to describe an action performed by the subject of the sentence (the water). Additionally, the verb tense agrees with the time frame of the sentence, which describes a past event.
1	The sentence "What the water did to the whole bottle was fill it." is grammatically correct. Here's why: * The subject of the sentence is "the water," which is a singular noun. This is followed by the verb "did" (a form of "to do"), which agrees with the singular subject. * "To the whole bottle" is a prepositional phrase that functions as the direct object of the sentence. It indicates the recipient of the action performed by the subject. * The predicate of the sentence is "was fill it," where "fill" is the past participle of the verb "to fill". The auxiliary verb "was" is used here because we're dealing with a passive construction ("what...was done"). Overall, the structure of the sentence is clear and unambiguous, making it grammatically correct.
0	In this sentence, there is a preposition error. Instead of saying "the fluid free," it should be "freely." This means that the corrected sentence would read as follows: "The tank leaked the fluid freely." The word "free" functions here as an adjective describing the noun "fluid," but what we want instead is for "fluid" to function as an adverb modifying the verb "leak." By changing "free" to "freely," we ensure proper grammatical construction.
1	The sentence "John lay the ball in the box" is grammatically correct. In this context, "lay" is used correctly as a past tense verb to indicate that John put the ball in the box while he was already on the ground or in a horizontal position. This form of the verb is often confused with "lie," which means to recline one's body without support. However, in this case, since John is putting something (the ball) somewhere (in the box), we use "lay."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence, "John," is the owner of the object of the sentence, "the book." Both nouns are clearly identified, and there are no errors in grammar or punctuation.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It uses a coordinating conjunction (and) to connect two independent clauses, each containing a verb ("persuaded" and "stay") and its own direct object ("Mary" and "Sue"). This structure is known as a "conjunctive pair" or "coordinated pair," where each clause could stand alone as a complete sentence but has been combined using a conjunction for concision or emphasis.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There is a slight awkwardness to the phrasing due to the use of "consider" followed by the phrase "even though...", but it does not constitute a grammatical error. Additionally, there is no punctuation issue or spelling mistake present. Therefore, I would classify this as a correct sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Mary," who is described by the adverb "beautifully." The verb of the sentence is "plays," which indicates that Mary is performing an action on the object "the violin." Both the subject-verb agreement and word choice are appropriate for this sentence, so it receives a score of 1.
0	The sentence contains a grammatical error related to subject-verb agreement. In this case, "John" is singular, so we need a verb form that agrees with it. Instead of "will learn," which suggests future tense but does not agree with the subject, use "will be learning." Additionally, since mastering a language typically takes time and practice, saying someone will "perfectly" learn another language right away may not be realistic or accurate. A more appropriate way to phrase this might be, "Clearly, John will probably start learning French immediately."
0	In English, when we have two objects (the person giving something and the person receiving something), we use the verb "give" followed by both objects without using "to." Therefore, the correct way to phrase the sentence would be "Sue gave Bill a book," instead of "Sue gave to Bill a book."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "The" is a definite article used before the noun phrase "men." It indicates that we're referring to specific men who have been previously mentioned or are known to the listener. * "Men" is the subject of the sentence, which refers to a group of male human beings. * "Will" is an auxiliary verb indicating future tense. It shows that the action (leaving) will happen in the future. * "All" is a determiner modifying "men," indicating every single one of them. * "Leave" is the main verb of the sentence, meaning to go away from a place. Therefore, the sentence "The men will all leave" is grammatically correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence, "John," is a proper noun that agrees with the verb "went" in number (both singular). Additionally, "home" acts as an adverbial complement specifying where John went, which makes the sentence complete and coherent.
0	The adverb "seriously" does not fit well in this context because it suggests that they presented themselves to Dean Mary in a serious manner rather than emphasizing their status as a genuine linguist. A better word choice would be something like "as a true or legitimate linguist." Also, there should be no comma after "Dean Mary," so the final corrected sentence reads: "They represented themselves seriously to Dean Mary as a true linguist."
0	In modern English, the subject of a sentence typically comes before the verb, while the object comes after it. The sentence "Us love they" violates these rules by placing "us," the intended object, ahead of the verb "love." A grammatically correct version might be "They love us."
1	The sentence "It is nice to go abroad" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "it," which refers to the idea or experience of going abroad being pleasant or enjoyable. The verb "is" agrees with the singular subject "it." The infinitive phrase "to go abroad" functions as the direct object of the linking verb "is." Overall, the structure of the sentence follows standard English syntax rules.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Mary," who is performing the action of intending something. The verb is "intended" and it is followed by its direct object, which is the infinitive phrase "John to go abroad." Infinitives can function as nouns in a sentence and here it receives the action from the verb "intend." Therefore, there are no grammatical errors in this sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The verb tense used here is the past perfect continuous ("remembered" is the past tense of "remember," indicating that the action occurred before another past action; "had been kissing" is the past perfect continuous tense, showing that the kissing started and ended before some other past event). It suggests that the speaker remembers a specific instance when they had previously kissed Mary but may be uncertain whether she also recalls it or if it even happened.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It contains a coordinating conjunction ("either") that connects two independent clauses ("I can't believe" and "Fred won't"). Both clauses have subjects ("I" and "Fred") and verbs ("can't believe" and "won't"), so they can stand alone as separate sentences if needed. Additionally, there is no punctuation error or misspelling in the sentence. Therefore, it is a grammatically correct sentence.
0	In this sentence, there is a missing article before "story." The corrected version would be "John wants to read Fred's story, and I also want to as well." However, it still sounds better to repeat the verb and say "John wants to read Fred's story, and I also want to read it too."
0	The sentence contains a grammatical error. The pronoun used after "to" should be in the objective case, which would be "whom" instead of "who". A corrected version of the sentence could read as follows: "We wanted to invite someone, but we couldn't decide whom to." Alternatively, for more informal contexts, one might say "but we didn't know who to invite," where both the subject and object forms of the word are "who", since it functions as the subject of the embedded question within the larger sentence structure.
1	The sentence "Mary will read Fred's story, and Joe will read Holly's." is grammatically correct. It consists of two independent clauses joined by a coordinating conjunction ("and"), where each clause contains its own subject ("Mary"/"Joe") and verb ("will read"). Additionally, the possessive forms "Fred's" and "Holly's" correctly indicate ownership of the respective stories being referred to.
0	This sentence is grammatically incorrect because it lacks a conjunction between the two clauses ("Mary claimed" and "Holly shouldn't"). A corrected version of the sentence would be: "Mary claimed that Holly shouldn't eat cabbage."
0	The second part of the sentence "I also came to be" is grammatically incorrect. It would make more sense if it was written as "and so did I", or simply "me too". The phrase "came to be" implies a passive construction that doesn't fit well here.
1	The sentence "If I can, I will work on it." is grammatically correct. It has a conditional structure using "if" followed by a subject-verb inversion ("can I"), which indicates that the speaker is unsure about their ability to do something. This type of construction is common in English and used appropriately here.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the first clause is "Joe's neuroses," which is plural and agrees with the verb "bother." Similarly, the subject of the second clause is "Sally," which is also singular and agrees with the verb "does." The coordinating conjunction "and" connects the two clauses effectively. Additionally, the pronoun "his" refers to the antecedent "Joe" clearly, and "too" functions as a sentential adverb indicating that Sally shares the same quality or behavior as Joe.
0	The sentence contains a grammatical error related to pronoun agreement. In the second part of the sentence, "it" does not agree with its antecedent "book." A corrected version would be: "I know which book José didn’t read for class, and which book Lilly did **read** for him."
0	The second part of the sentence contains a grammatical error. It should be either "this is the one that Fred won't do" or "this is the one Fred won't do." In the original sentence, "it" doesn't have a clear antecedent, making it unclear what "it" refers to. Additionally, using "that" instead of "which" would make the clause restrictive, indicating that there is only one thing Fred won't do (as opposed to non-restrictive clauses where both options remain possible).
0	The sentence contains a misplaced modifier error. The phrase "and which book Bob said that you hadn't" is modifying "Mag," making it unclear what book Bob had referred to as one that "you hadn't" read. To fix the error, we can rephrase the sentence as follows: "I know which book Mag read and which book Bob said you hadn't read."
0	The sentence contains multiple errors. First, there is a missing article before "report." It should be "the report" instead of just "report." Additionally, the word order in the last part of the sentence is incorrect. Instead of saying "that you hadn't," it would be more appropriate to say "which you had not read." So, a corrected version of the sentence might be: "I know which book Mag read, and which book Bob read my report that you had not read."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. Here's a breakdown of why: * "I'm sure" functions as a conjunctive adverb that expresses the speaker's confidence or certainty about what follows. It is correctly placed before the subject ("I") and verb ("would like"). * "I would like" is a polite way to express desire for something. In this case, it indicates that the speaker wants someone (implied by "him") to do something (eat). * "Him" is a pronoun referring to a male person who will be eating. * "to eat" is an infinitive phrase that serves as the direct object of the sentence, indicating the action that the subject desires. * "fruit" is a plural noun that refers to produce from trees or plants that have seeds enclosed within edible flesh. * "more than" is a comparative expression used here to indicate a preference between two things. * "I would" is another instance of the auxiliary verb "would," which shows hypotheticality or politeness. * "cookies" is a plural countable noun that refers to small baked goods made from flour, sugar, eggs, and fat.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The phrase "after Mary did talk about him" serves as a dependent clause modifying when Rusty talked about himself. While it might be more common to say "after Mary talked about him," the use of "did" here emphasizes that Mary's action occurred before Rusty's. It creates a slight pause for dramatic effect or additional emphasis on the contrast between their actions.
0	The sentence contains a redundant use of the verb "talk." A corrected version could be either "Fred talked about everything before Rusty did" or "Fred talked about everything before Rusty talked about something," but not as it's currently written.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "John," who is performing the action described by the verb "meets." The direct object of the sentence is "Mary," whom John is meeting. Both names are in their base form (neither takes a possessive or plural suffix), which indicates that they are being used as proper nouns rather than common nouns. Overall, the syntax and word choice in this sentence conform to standard English usage.
0	The verb "perceive" requires a subject that can perform the action of perception. In this case, it's unclear what or who the subject is supposed to be. Additionally, there is no determiner before "easily," which makes the sentence grammatically incorrect. A corrected version could be: "The problem is perceived easily."
1	The sentence "A hundred men surrounded the fort" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "A hundred men" is a determiner phrase that functions as the subject of the sentence. Both "a" and "hundred" modify the noun "men," indicating an approximate quantity rather than specifying an exact number. This use of "a" followed by another quantifier such as "hundred" is called a partitive construction and is common in English (e.g., "a lot of people," "a bunch of flowers"). * "surrounded" is the verb of the sentence, linking the subject to its complement ("the fort") through transitivity. It agrees with the plural subject in terms of number. * "the fort" is a noun phrase functioning as the object of the preposition "around." As it begins with the definite article "the," we can infer that the speaker assumes their audience knows which specific fort they have in mind. Overall, the sentence has clear grammatical structure, appropriate word choice, and logical meaning.
0	The verb "elected" requires an object to complete its meaning. In this case, it would be more grammatically correct to say "We elected **someone**," where "someone" represents the person who was chosen for a position or office. Without an object, the sentence seems incomplete and unclear about what action was taken regarding the subject "we."
0	The sentence contains a misplaced relative clause, which makes it unclear what "he" refers to. A possible corrected version could be: "Which report stating that John was incompetent did he submit?" or "He submitted a report stating that John was incompetent. Which one was it?"
1	The sentence "Mary has always preferred lemons to limes" is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("Mary"), a helping verb ("has"), a past participle verb form ("preferred"), and two objects of comparison ("lemons" and "limes"). There are no spelling or punctuation errors, and the word order follows standard English syntax rules. Therefore, it can be labeled as grammatically correct.
0	The sentence is missing a preposition after "whining." A better way to phrase it would be "He let the cats that were whining out" or "He let the cats that were whining outside." Additionally, some people might argue for using "which" instead of "that," but I personally prefer "that" here because it seems more restrictive (i.e., only letting out certain cats). However, both "which" and "that" can technically work depending on who you ask!
1	The sentence "What did Bill buy?" is grammatically correct. It is a question that conforms to standard English syntax rules. The subject of the sentence is "Bill," which is the direct object of the verb "buy." The word "what" serves as the subject complement, asking for further information about the action performed by the subject. Overall, there are no grammatical errors or awkward constructions in this sentence, so I would rate it as 1 (correct).
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Mary," which is a noun that refers to a person. The verb of the sentence is "saw," which is a past tense form of the verb "see." The direct object of the sentence is "the boy," which follows the verb and receives the action of the verb. Finally, there is a prepositional phrase "toward the railroad station" that describes where the boy was walking. All elements of the sentence are used correctly, so it is grammatical.
0	The sentence contains a couple of errors. First, the word "giver" should be "given." Second, the verb tense is inconsistent; it switches between past perfect ("had been made") and simple past ("John had lied"). It would be better to use consistent verb tenses throughout the sentence. Here's a possible correction: Corrected version: A proof that the claim had been made was provided because John had lied.
0	This sentence contains multiple errors that make it difficult to understand. The phrase "He attributed to" should be "He attributed," and there should be a comma after "transducer." Additionally, "which destroyed" should be "that destroyed" or better yet, "that had destroyed" for clarity and grammatical accuracy. A corrected version could read as follows: "He attributed the fire that had destroyed most of my factory to a short circuit caused by an overloaded transducer."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "The mayor" is a noun phrase that serves as the subject of the sentence. It refers to a specific person who holds a particular office. * "regarded" is the verb that links the subject ("the mayor") to the rest of the sentence. In this case, it indicates the mayor's opinion or attitude towards something (namely, the proposal). * "as being absurd" is a participial phrase that modifies the verb "regarded." Participles function similarly to adjectives because they describe or modify other words in the sentence. Here, "absurd" describes the nature of the proposal. * "the proposal" is another noun phrase that functions as the direct object of the sentence. It receives the action of the verb "regarded" and specifies what the mayor thought was absurd. * Finally, "to build a sidewalk from Dartmouth to Smith" is a prepositional phrase that acts as a complement to the direct object "proposal." It provides additional information about where the proposed sidewalk would be located. Overall, all parts of the sentence work together to convey a clear meaning without any grammatical errors or awkward constructions.
1	The sentence "I want that Bill left to remain a secret" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "I want" is a common construction used to express desire or intention. * "that" is a conjunction introducing a subordinate clause (in this case, "Bill left to remain a secret"). * "Bill left" is a simple past tense verb phrase indicating that Bill has already departed. * "to remain" is an infinitive phrase acting as the complement of the verb "left." It indicates the purpose for which Bill left. * "a secret" is a noun phrase serving as the object of the preposition "to." It tells us what Bill wants to remain. Overall, the sentence conveys the meaning that the speaker desires Bill's departure to keep something hidden or confidential.
0	This sentence contains multiple errors. The word "who" should be replaced with "that," and the second instance of the verb "drives" should be changed to "is driven." Additionally, there is no need for the first occurrence of "as." A corrected version would read: "I know a man that Tom drives." However, even with these changes, it's still unclear what exactly is being conveyed; perhaps rephrasing the entire statement might be necessary.
0	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in this sentence. The plural noun phrase "drowning cats" does not agree with the singular verb "is." It should be changed to "are" to match the plural subject. Additionally, it would also improve clarity to rephrase the first part of the sentence as "Despite the fact that drowning cats is against the law," or something similar. So a corrected version could read: "Drowning cats are hard to rescue, despite the fact that it's against the law."
1	The sentence "Muriel said nothing else than that she had been insulted" is grammatically correct. It contains a correlative conjunction ("not only...but also") where "nothing else than" functions as "but also." Here, it means "Muriel said only that she had been insulted," emphasizing what exactly Muriel expressed without adding or implying anything further.
0	The sentence contains a grammatical error. In this case, the subject ("Himself") cannot be the direct object of the verb "understood." A more grammatically correct version would be something like "Rutherford understands himself" or "Rutherford is understood by him," depending on what was intended.
1	The sentence "I feel that Arch will show up" is grammatically correct. Here's a breakdown of why it works: * "I feel" is a common way to express an opinion or intuition about something that might happen in the future. * "that" introduces a clause (Arch will show up) which functions as the direct object of the verb "feel." * "Arch" is a proper noun referring to someone named Arch. It's capitalized correctly. * "will show up" indicates that Arch is expected to arrive at some point in the future. This use of "will" for future tense is perfectly fine. Overall, there don't seem to be any grammatical errors in this sentence!
0	There is a grammatical error in the sentence. It should be "The proof that this set is recursive is difficult" or "It is difficult to prove that this set is recursive." Also, it would improve clarity if there was more context about what "this set" refers to.
0	This sentence contains a grammatical error known as a misplaced modifier. In this case, the phrase "which Henry plays the lute and sings" is intended to modify "the madrigals," but it is placed after the word "sound." To fix this error, we can revise the sentence as follows: "The madrigals that Henry plays and sings sound lousy." Alternatively, we could say, "Henry's playing and singing of the madrigals sounds lousy."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. Each part of the sentence has a clear subject (Tom, I, Suzie) and verb (picked, washed, will prepare), and the subjects and verbs agree in number. Additionally, the conjunction "and" is used correctly to connect three independent clauses. Finally, the pronoun "these" is used consistently to refer to both the grapes and the turnips.
1	The sentence "Where did you go and who ate what?" is grammatically correct. It follows standard English syntax rules for a question, which requires subject-auxiliary verb inversion ("did" comes before "you"). Additionally, it contains a coordinating conjunction ("and") that connects two independent clauses, each having its own subject and predicate.
0	The sentence contains multiple grammatical errors. The first error occurs after "which boy's," where there should be a noun or pronoun instead of "did." Additionally, "guardian's employer" should have a possessive apostrophe only on "guardian," as it indicates possession (the employer of the guardian). Lastly, "president" needs to be connected to a specific entity; otherwise, it does not make sense without additional context. A corrected version could read: "Which boy's guardian did we elect as the employer's president?" However, even that sentence requires more context for proper understanding.
1	The sentence "How sane is Peter?" is grammatically correct. It is a question asking about someone's mental state using the adjective "sane." The word order is correct, and there are no spelling or punctuation errors. Therefore, I would rate this sentence as 1, indicating that it is grammatically correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It contains two independent clauses joined by the conjunction 'and'. Each clause has a subject ('I' and 'my dad') and a predicate ('live at...'). Additionally, both clauses contain additional details that provide further context to the location of each person's residence using prepositional phrases ('at the place where...'). Overall, the sentence structure is clear and easy to understand.
0	The pronoun 'it' used to refer to Route 150 and the location where it crosses the Hudson River has been repeated twice in the second clause of the sentence. To avoid repetition, we can rewrite the sentence as follows: "I live at the place where Route 150 crosses the Hudson River, and so does my dad."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The phrase "to make up to" means to try to become friendly with someone again after a disagreement or to win someone's favor. Therefore, the question "Who is she trying to make up to now?" is asking who the person referred to as "she" is attempting to reconcile with or gain the approval of at the present time.
0	The past participle form of the verb "get" is "gotten" when used in American English in a transitive sense (meaning it requires an object). However, in this case, "was gotten" is incorrect because there's no direct object for the action implied by "was gotten." A better way to phrase it would be "Wind had obtained information about a plot to negotiate..." or simply "A plot to negotiate...had been uncovered," depending on what exactly is meant by "Wind."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "Mike" is a proper noun referring to a person, so it is correctly capitalized. * "talked" is the past tense of the verb "to talk," which agrees with the time frame indicated by "yesterday." * "about" is a preposition that indicates the topic of conversation. * "politics" is a plural countable noun indicating the subject matter of the discussion. It does not need an article ("a" or "the") because the meaning is clear from context. * "yesterday" is an adverb that specifies when the action took place. * "to" is a preposition introducing the indirect object of the sentence. * "my friends" refers to people known to the speaker, who are the intended recipients of Mike's conversation. They form the indirect object of the sentence.
1	The sentence “It was expected by the reporters that the principal would fire some teacher” is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is “it,” which refers to the expectation or assumption held by the group of people referred to as “the reporters.” This is followed by a verb tense shift from past passive (was expected) to present active (would fire), but it’s used appropriately here because they anticipate something happening in the future. Additionally, there's no agreement issue between singular nouns ("reporters" and "principal") and plural verbs. Overall, this sentence follows standard English rules for syntax and usage, so I would classify it as being correct.
0	The pronoun used in this sentence does not match the gender of the name 'Mike'. The word 'she' should be replaced with 'he', as 'Mike' is typically a masculine name. Therefore, the corrected version would be: "Which hat did Mike quip that he never wore?"
0	The sentence contains a grammatical error known as a negative question formation. To form a negative question correctly, we need to use "didn't" before the subject instead of using "never." Therefore, the corrected version would be: "Which girl did Mike quip didn't wear this hat?"
1	The sentence “We donated wire for the convicts to build cages with” is grammatically correct. It contains a simple subject (“we”) and a verb (“donated”), followed by a prepositional phrase (“for the convicts”) that modifies the object of the sentence (“wire”). This is then further modified by another prepositional phrase (“to build cages with”). All of the words are spelled correctly, and there are no punctuation or agreement errors. Therefore, I would rate this sentence as being grammatically correct.
0	The sentence "I won't have some money" is grammatically incorrect because of the word "some." In negative statements, we use "any" instead of "some." So, the correct form would be "I won't have any money."
1	The sentence "Do you believe the claim that somebody was looking for something?" is grammatically correct. The subject-auxiliary inversion ("do" + infinitive verb) is used to form a question, making it grammatically sound. Additionally, the clause "that somebody was looking for something" contains no errors and adds context to the question being asked. Overall, there are no grammatical or syntactical issues present in this sentence.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no spelling errors or punctuation mistakes. Additionally, the verb tenses agree, and the subject-verb agreement is consistent throughout the sentence. Furthermore, there is a clear meaning expressed without ambiguity, making it a well-constructed English sentence.
1	The sentence "That Sam sometimes didn't sleep must have pleased somebody" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "That" can be used as a conjunction to introduce a clause that explains or gives more information about something previously mentioned. In this case, it refers back to the previous conversation or context where someone might have been talking about Sam's sleeping habits. * "Sam" is a proper noun referring to a specific person. It is correctly capitalized. * "sometimes" is an adverb modifying the verb "sleep." It indicates that the action of sleeping occurs occasionally but not regularly. * "didn't sleep" is the contraction for "did not sleep," which is the past tense of the verb "to sleep" (in its base form) combined with the negation particle "not." This construction is appropriate because it emphasizes the negative polarity of the situation, i.e., the absence of sleep. * "must have pleased" is the present perfect tense of the verb "please." It conveys speculation or deduction based on evidence from the past. * "somebody" is an indefinite pronoun indicating an unspecified individual. It agrees with the plural subject "Sam" through the use of the singular form "somebody," which is acceptable when referring to one unknown entity.
0	The pronoun used in a sentence must agree with its antecedent in number. In this case, "himself" is a reflexive pronoun that refers back to the noun or pronoun "Winston." However, since "I" (the subject of the sentence) is singular, it requires a singular object pronoun such as "he," rather than the plural form "they" or the reflexive form "themselves." Therefore, the correct version of this sentence would be "I talked to Winston about him."
0	The first part of the sentence has a couple of issues. Instead of saying "That the fuzz wanted him worried", it should be "That the fuzz worrying him". Additionally, there needs to be consistency in verb tense; either both parts of the sentence need to use past tense or present tense. Here is the corrected version: "Either the fuzz wanting him worried doesn't bother John, or the fuzz wants her not to be worried."
0	This sentence contains a common error known as a tense mismatch. The first verb "will work" is in the future tense, while the second verb "will be working" is also in the future continuous tense. To make the sentence grammatically correct, both verbs need to be in either the future or the future continuous tense. Here's one way to fix it: "I'll work on it if Sam works on it." Alternatively, for the original meaning of continuing action, use "is going to be working": "I'll work on it if Sam is going to be working on it."
1	The sentence "I'll work on it if I can." is grammatically correct. It contains a first-person singular subject ("I") followed by a contraction of the auxiliary verb "will" and the base form of the main verb "work". The clause "if I can" functions as a conditional adverbial, expressing that the action will take place under certain conditions. All elements are used correctly, making the sentence grammatical.
0	The preposition "with" is incorrect in this context. A more appropriate way to phrase the sentence would be "Here is a knife for you to cut the onions up." Alternatively, one could say "Here's a knife with which you can cut up the onions," but that sounds rather formal and stilted in everyday conversation.
0	The word "which" introduces a clause that provides additional information about something previously mentioned (in this case, "Fluffy is sick"). This type of clause requires a comma before it to separate it from the rest of the sentence, but also needs to be linked to what comes before by using relative pronouns such as "who," "whom," or "that." Here, replacing "which" with "that" would make the sentence grammatically correct: "Fluffy is sick, **that** not everyone knows." Alternatively, moving the clause after the main one without changing anything else would also work: "Which not everybody knows, Fluffy is sick."
1	The sentence "Maxwell is quite a doctor" is grammatically correct. Here, 'quite' is used as an adverb to express that Maxwell has a significant degree of being a doctor (perhaps meaning he is very skilled or experienced). There are no spelling errors, punctuation errors, word choice issues, or subject-verb agreement problems. Therefore, I would classify this sentence as grammatically correct and assign it a score of 1.
0	There is a superfluous comma after "tall" which creates a comma splice error as it separates two independent clauses without proper conjunction or punctuation. A corrected version could be: "The younger woman might have been tall and the older one definitely was blond."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It uses the correct punctuation to separate two independent clauses ("Sally is tall, and may be blond" and "Sheila is short, and definitely is, blond") and correctly employs coordinating conjunctions (and) to connect these clauses. Additionally, it uses proper capitalization for names and adheres to subject-verb agreement rules throughout both clauses. Overall, the sentence has a clear structure that follows standard English conventions.
1	The sentence "I have to try to finish grading some papers" is grammatically correct. It has a clear subject ("I"), helping verb ("have to"), main verb ("try"), infinitive phrase ("to finish"), object of the preposition ("grading"), and its direct object ("some papers"). All words are used correctly, and there are no spelling or punctuation errors.
0	There is a redundant preposition "for" in the phrase "to be planned." Also, it would be more appropriate to say that the socks are ready "to wear" instead of "to put on to be planned," as being planned isn't something that one typically does with socks. A corrected version could read: "The socks are ready for you to put on."
1	The sentence "It is easy to play sonatas on this violin" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "it," which refers to the idea that playing sonatas on this violin is easy. The verb is "is," which agrees with the singular subject "it." The phrase "to play sonatas on this violin" functions as a complement to the linking verb "is" and describes what it is easy to do. This sentence has a clear structure and follows standard rules for English syntax.
1	The sentence "This violin is difficult to play sonatas on" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "This violin" is a noun phrase that refers to a specific violin. * "is" is a linking verb connecting the subject ("this violin") to its complement ("difficult to play sonatas on"). * "difficult" modifies the infinitive phrase "to play sonatas on," indicating the degree of challenge associated with playing sonatas on the violin. * "to play sonatas on" is an infinitive phrase acting as the complement of the adjective "difficult." It functions as an adverbial of manner, describing how the action (playing) is performed (on the violin). Overall, the sentence conveys a clear meaning and follows standard English grammar rules.
0	The sentence is missing a verb after "my father" for the second clause. A corrected version could be: "My mother is easy to please; she pleases my father easily."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It contains a coordinating conjunction (",") that separates two independent clauses ("it had started to rain" and "he had no umbrella"). Each clause has its own subject-verb agreement, which is necessary for grammaticality. Additionally, there is no punctuation or spelling error in the sentence. Therefore, I would rate this sentence as grammatically correct and assign it a score of 1.
0	This sentence contains multiple errors. The first error occurs after "that" - a noun or pronoun is required here but instead we have "robbery," which is a gerund (verb ending in "-ing") used as a noun. A possible correction could be "the robbery." However, even if we make this change, the overall structure of the sentence remains unclear. It seems there may be some missing words or phrases for the sentence to make sense. For example, one way to rephrase it would be: "It's terrible that the cops spoke to the janitor about the robbery yesterday."
0	The sentence contains multiple errors that make it difficult to understand the intended meaning. Firstly, there's no clear connection between the three clauses - "Every student", "and he wears socks", and "is a swinger". It seems like the second clause ("and he wears socks") might be missing a subject or needs to be connected more clearly to one of the other clauses. Additionally, using the term "swinger" without context can lead to misinterpretations as it has various meanings based on the context (e.g., someone who frequently changes partners or dancing style). Thus, the overall structure and clarity need improvement. A possible revision could be: "Each student arrives wearing socks, demonstrating their unique swing dance moves."
1	The sentence "That girl was given my binoculars by him." is grammatically correct. Here's a breakdown of why: - "That girl" refers to a specific female individual who has been previously mentioned or is known to the speaker and listener. It is a demonstrative determiner followed by a singular noun. - "was given" is the past tense form of the verb "to give," which indicates that the action occurred in the past. In this case, it shows passive voice because we don't know the exact subject performing the giving action. - "my binoculars" denotes possession; here, "my" functions as a possessive adjective modifying the plural noun "binoculars." - "by him" represents the agent (the one doing the action) in the passive construction. "Him" is a pronoun referring to a male individual, while "by" serves as a preposition indicating agency.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Bill," who is negated by "didn't." The verb is "allege" which means to assert something without proof. The indirect object is "that," followed by a clause beginning with "Roger had eaten anything." Both clauses have subjects ("Bill" and "Roger") as well as verbs ("had eaten" and "alleged"). Additionally, the use of "anything" implies that no specific food was mentioned beforehand, making it clear why there would be no need for an article (a, an) or quantifier (some, many).
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Nobody," which is a negative form of "somebody." It's followed by "who" introducing a relative clause modifying the subject. The verb "hates" agrees with the singular subject "nobody." The prepositional phrase "to eat anything" functions as the direct object of the verb "hates." Finally, the adverbial infinitive phrase "should work in a delicatessen" describes where someone who doesn't hate eating anything should work. Therefore, there are no grammatical errors in this sentence.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. Here's a breakdown of the structure: * Everybody (subject) + around here (adverbial phrase modifying the subject) + who ever buys anything on credit (relative clause modifying the subject) * talks (predicate verb) + in his sleep (prepositional phrase modifying the predicate verb)
0	The sentence contains a small error related to pronoun agreement. It should be "the name of someone" instead of "somebody." In modern standard English, we use "someone" as a singular indefinite pronoun while referring to people; hence it requires a singular verb or singular possessive determiner (such as "his," "her," or just "'s") following it. Here, using "somebody" breaks that rule since "somebody" implies another person, which would require a different formulation altogether for grammatical consistency.
1	The sentence "No writer, and no playwright, meets in Vienna" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * There is a subject ("no writer" and "no playwright") and a verb ("meets"). * The sentence uses the present simple tense correctly to describe a general truth or rule (that there are no writers or playwrights meeting in Vienna). * The punctuation is also correct, including the comma after "writer," which separates two independent clauses that are connected by the coordinating conjunction "and." * Therefore, the sentence is grammatically correct.
0	The sentence contains a grammatical error. It should be "No writer nor any playwright **meets** IN Vienna," not 'meets in'. In American English, it's also common to say "No writer, nor any playwright, does meet in Vienna."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "That", which refers to the idea or concept that someone might marry a student being discussed. The verb is "is," which agrees with its singular subject. The phrase "any student" functions as the direct object of the sentence. Overall, there are no grammatical errors or awkward phrasings in this sentence.
1	The sentence "Felicia kicked the ball off the bench" is grammatically correct. Here's a breakdown of why it works: * "Felicia" is the subject of the sentence, which refers to the person who performed the action. It is correctly identified as a proper noun (name). * "kicked" is the verb that describes what Felicia did. This word agrees with the singular subject "Felicia." * "the ball" serves as the direct object of the sentence because it receives the action from the verb "kicked." Using the definite article "the" before "ball" indicates that we have previously introduced or specified which ball we are referring to. * "off" functions as an adverb modifying the verb "kicked," specifying the direction of her kick. * "the bench" is a prepositional phrase acting as an oblique; it explains where the ball went after being kicked off. Again, using the definite article "the" before "bench" shows familiarity with the specific location.
1	The sentence “I sent the package halfway around the world” is grammatically correct. It contains a subject (“I”), a verb (“sent”) and an object (“the package”). Additionally, it uses a prepositional phrase (“halfway around the world”) to provide more information about where the package was sent. All of these elements work together smoothly to create a coherent and complete thought.
0	The phrase "gave the ball out" is incorrect because it implies that the ball was somehow inside Sam, which he then expelled. A more appropriate way to express what I believe is intended would be "Sam took the ball out of the basket."
1	The sentence "Sam offered the ball out of the basket" is grammatically correct. Here's a breakdown of why: * "Sam" is the subject of the sentence and it is a proper noun, so it starts with a capital letter. * "offered" is the past tense of the verb "to offer," which indicates that the action took place in the past. It agrees with the subject "Sam." * "the ball" is a noun phrase serving as the direct object of the sentence. It receives the action of being offered by Sam. * "out of" is a preposition followed by the noun phrase "the basket." Together they form a prepositional phrase indicating where the ball came from or its origin. * Overall, the structure of the sentence follows standard English syntax rules, making it a grammatical sentence.
1	The sentence "Park Square has a festive air" is grammatically correct. It consists of a subject ("Park Square") and a predicate ("has a festive air"). Both the subject and the predicate are expressed by noun phrases, which is perfectly acceptable in English grammar. Additionally, there are no spelling or punctuation errors, making it a well-formed sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "The" is a definite article that agrees with its plural noun "worker." * "Worker" is a singular common noun referring to someone who performs work or labor. * "Will have" indicates future tense, indicating something that has not yet happened but is expected to happen. * "A job" refers to employment or a specific task or duty assigned to someone. It agrees with the subject "the worker" through verb agreement rules (singular). Overall, the sentence conveys a clear meaning without any grammatical errors.
0	The sentence contains a pronoun error. It should be "you all" or "you guys" instead of just "you." Here's why: When referring to more than one person as the object of a verb, we often use the form "you all" or "you guys." In this case, it would make sense for the speaker to say something like "No one can forgive that comment to you all," indicating that multiple people were offended by the comment. Without the "all" or another pluralizing term, the sentence implies that only one person was addressed, which doesn't fit with the idea that "no one" could have forgiven the comment.
1	The sentence "We launched the rocket to the moon, but it blew up before it got there" is grammatically correct. The subject-verb agreement is consistent throughout the sentence, punctuation is used correctly, and word choice and syntax are appropriate for standard American English. Additionally, the sentence has a clear meaning that can be understood by native speakers of English.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no spelling errors or punctuation marks that need correction. Additionally, the sentence structure follows standard English syntax rules, making it a well-constructed and coherent statement.
1	The sentence "I lent the book partway to Tony" is grammatically correct. In this sentence, "lent" is the past tense of the verb "to lend," which means to give something temporarily to someone. Here, the speaker gave the book to Tony for some time before getting it back or expecting to get it back later. Additionally, "partway" functions as an adverb modifying how the action was performed, meaning that the speaker only partially lent the book (perhaps by allowing Tony to borrow just a few chapters). This word choice also implies there may be more to come regarding who gets access to the rest of the book or when they will receive it. Overall, the structure, grammar, syntax, and vocabulary usage align with standard English conventions.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "the farmer," which is doing the action of loading something (a verb), and that something is "the cart." Furthermore, we have a prepositional phrase "with apples" indicating what was being loaded into the cart. All parts of speech are used correctly here, so I would classify this as a correct English sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "The" is a definite article used before singular nouns. In this case, it correctly precedes "farmer." * "Farmer" is a common noun that refers to someone who cultivates land or raises crops for a living. It is appropriately used here as the subject of the sentence. * "Dumped" is the past tense of the verb "to dump," which means to drop something carelessly or throw away without concern. It indicates what action the farmer took. * "The" is again used as a definite article, this time before "cart." Since we assume there is only one cart being referred to in this context, using "the" is appropriate. * "Cart" is a common noun referring to a vehicle with two wheels drawn by a horse or other animal. While "with apples" specifies what was inside the cart, the word itself does not require any additional articles because it already includes the word "apples" after it. Thus, no further modification is necessary.
0	The verb "carved" does not agree with its subject "Martha." Since "Martha" is singular, the past tense of the verb should be "carved," but it requires an object to complete the meaning (e.g., Martha carved a toy). Therefore, we need to add an article before "baby" or rephrase the sentence as follows: "Martha carved a toy for the baby out of wood."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The present tense verb "cuts" agrees with its subject "bread," which is a singular third-person noun. Additionally, the word order is appropriate for a simple declarative statement.
0	The verb "broke" does not make sense in this context because it typically means to cause something to break or become broken. Additionally, people cannot be "broken." A more appropriate verb might have been "hurt," which would change the sentence to "Janet hurt Bill's finger."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence, "Janet," is performing the action described by the verb, "broke." Additionally, the direct object of the sentence, "the cup," clearly identifies what was broken. There are no grammatical errors or awkward phrasings that would detract from the clarity or coherence of this sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("the visitor"), an action verb ("rang") and an object ("the bell"). The word order follows standard English syntax rules. Additionally, all of the words used in the sentence are spelled correctly and there are no punctuation errors present.
0	The phrase "pulled free" is grammatically incorrect because it lacks a clear subject or object. It's unclear what was pulled or who did the pulling. A more complete version of the sentence might be something like "We pulled the boat free," which includes both a subject (we) and an object (the boat).
1	The sentence "That movie always shocks people" is grammatically correct. Here's a breakdown of why: * "That movie" serves as the subject of the sentence and refers to a specific film that is known or has been previously mentioned. * "always" functions as an adverb modifying the verb phrase "shocks people." It indicates that the action of shocking happens regularly over time. * "shocks" is the main verb of the sentence, indicating that the movie has an impact on people that causes surprise or astonishment. * "people" is the direct object of the verb "shocks," referring to the individuals who experience the shock caused by the movie. Overall, the sentence follows standard English grammar rules and uses appropriate vocabulary to convey its meaning effectively.
1	The sentence "That movie always shocks" is grammatically correct. It consists of a subordinating conjunction ("that"), a noun phrase ("that movie") acting as the subject, and a verb phrase ("always shocks") that describes what the subject does. There are no spelling errors or awkward phrasings to draw attention, so it seems perfectly fine for casual conversation or formal writing.
0	The sentence "Sharon came the room" is incorrect because it lacks a preposition to connect "came" and "room". A correct version of this sentence would be "Sharon came into the room" or "Sharon came out of the room", depending on the intended meaning.
1	The sentence "Bill sent a package to Tom" is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("Bill"), a verb ("sent") that agrees with the subject in number (both singular), and a direct object ("a package"). Additionally, it includes a prepositional phrase ("to Tom") which indicates where or to whom the action was directed. All of these elements combine to form a complete thought, making this a well-formed English sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "that acorn," which is singular. The verb that agrees with a singular subject is "will grow." The object of the preposition "into" is "an oak tree," which is also grammatically correct. Therefore, there are no errors in this sentence.
1	The sentence "He turned into a frog" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "he," which is the pronoun referring to a male person or animal. The verb is "turned," which indicates that the subject has undergone some sort of transformation. The preposition "into" introduces the new state or condition of the subject, which is "a frog." Therefore, there are no grammatical errors in this sentence, making it a correct usage of English language rules.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "I," which is the person performing the action. The verb is "mixed," which describes the action being performed. The direct object of the sentence is "the sugar," which is what is being acted upon by the verb. Finally, we have the prepositional phrase "into the butter" which tells us where the action took place or the goal of the action. Overall, the structure of the sentence is clear and easy to understand, making it a grammatically correct sentence.
0	The sentence "Brian threw the fence with the stick" is grammatically incorrect because we cannot throw a fence with a stick. We can say that Brian threw something (e.g., a ball) with a stick or that he knocked down the fence using some tool or equipment, but saying that he threw the fence itself with a stick does not make sense.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence, "Mira," is clearly identified as the one doing the action (condemning), which is indicated by the verb "condemned." We also have a direct object, "Terry," who receives the action of being condemned, and a prepositional phrase "for the accident" that provides additional information about why Terry was condemned. All of these elements work together to form a complete sentence that is easy to understand.
1	The sentence "We investigated the area for bombs" is grammatically correct. Here's a breakdown of why it works: * "We" is a subject pronoun used to indicate the person or people performing the action (investigating). * "investigated" is the past tense of the verb "investigate," which means to examine something carefully in order to discover more about it. In this case, the subjects ("we") are examining the area for bombs. * "the area" refers to a specific location that has been previously mentioned or understood from context. Using the definite article "the" indicates that there is only one particular region being discussed. * "for bombs" explains what the investigators were looking for during their examination. This prepositional phrase modifies the verb "investigated." Overall, the structure and word choice create a clear, concise sentence without any grammatical errors.
1	The sentence “I sensed his eagerness” is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is “I,” which is a pronoun that refers to the speaker or writer. The verb “sensed” is a past tense form of the verb “to sense.” It indicates that the action was completed in the past. The object of the sentence is “his eagerness,” which consists of the possessive determiner “his” and the noun “eagerness.” This phrase functions as the direct object because it receives the action of the verb “sensed.” Overall, the structure of the sentence is clear and concise, making it easy for readers to understand the intended meaning.
1	The sentence "They praised the dedication in the volunteers" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "They" refers to a plural subject, which can be one or more people. In this case, it likely refers to multiple individuals who have observed the volunteers. * "praised" is the past tense of the verb "to praise," which means to express approval or admiration for someone or something. It agrees with the plural subject "they." * "the dedication" is a noun phrase that functions as the direct object of the sentence. "Dedication" is a countable noun that takes the definite article "the" when referring to a specific instance of dedication (in this case, the dedication shown by the volunteers). * "in the volunteers" is a prepositional phrase modifying "dedication." The preposition "in" indicates location or source and shows where the dedication was found (i.e., among the volunteers).
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The past tense of the verb "to be" (is) is used correctly with the subject "the earth." Additionally, the passive voice ("was believed") is used appropriately here.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence, "Sarah," is clearly identified as a proper noun. The verb, "smiled," agrees with the singular subject in number and tense. Additionally, the phrase "a charming smile" functions as a predicate nominative, reiterating the description of the action being performed by the subject. Overall, there are no grammatical errors or awkward phrasings in this sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Sandra," which is connected to the verb "beamed" through the third-person singular present tense suffix "-ed." The object of the verb is "a cheerful welcome," which describes what Sandra did. Overall, the sentence has a clear structure and meaning, making it grammatically sound.
1	The sentence "You've really lived it up" is grammatically correct. It consists of a subject ("you"), an auxiliary verb ("have") that creates the present perfect tense when combined with the past participle form of the main verb ("lived"), and an adverb phrase ("really") modifying the verb. Additionally, "it up" functions as a complement to the verb "lived." Overall, the structure and usage of words make for a proper sentence construction.
0	The verb "lift" needs to agree with its subject in number. In this case, the subject is "paperback books," which is plural. Therefore, the verb should be "lift" instead of "lifts." A corrected version would be: "Paperback books lift onto the table easily."
0	In present tense, we use 'lift' as the verb when referring to one person or thing doing the action (singular) and 'lift**s'** for multiple persons or things performing the action (plural). Since there seems to be more than one book being referred to here ("the books"), the correct form of the verb should have an -"s": "The books lift**s** onto the table." However, even after changing the verb form, it still sounds unnatural because a plural subject usually takes a plural object, so two separate actions would sound better: "Lift the books onto the table," which implies that someone else is carrying out the action of placing them on the table.
1	The sentence "Jessica loaded boxes under the wagon" is grammatically correct. However, without additional context it's unclear whether the intended meaning is that Jessica put boxes underneath the wagon or that she loaded boxes onto the wagon. But assuming the sentence is conveying what the speaker intends to say, there are no grammatical errors in this sentence.
1	The sentence "Jessica loaded boxes on the wagon" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Jessica," a proper noun that refers to a person. The verb is "loaded," which is in the past tense and agrees with the subject. The direct object of the sentence is "boxes," a plural noun that takes the preposition "on" followed by the indirect object "the wagon." Each element of the sentence has a clear function and contributes to the overall meaning.
1	The sentence "Jessica crammed boxes at the truck" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Jessica," and the verb is "crammed." The direct object is "boxes," which follows the verb and receives the action. The prepositional phrase "at the truck" tells us where the action took place. Therefore, there are no grammatical errors in this sentence.
0	The verb "butter" requires a direct object to complete its meaning. In this case, the direct object of the sentence is missing. A more grammatically correct version would be "Lora butterED the toast," where "the toast" is the direct object receiving the action of being buttered by Lora.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence, "Carla," is a proper noun that agrees with the verb "shoveled." Additionally, the past tense form of the verb accurately describes a completed action performed by the subject on the object "the walk."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence, "Nora," is the person performing the action described by the verb, "sent." The direct object of the sentence, "the book," receives the action of being sent. Both the subject and verb agree in number (singular), making for a complete and coherent sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Nora," who is performing the action of sending something. The indirect object is "Peter," who is receiving the direct object, which is "the book." The word order follows standard English syntax rules, making it a well-formed sentence.
1	The sentence "Carla slid the book" is grammatically correct. It consists of a subject ("Carla"), a verb ("slid") that agrees with the subject in number (both singular), and a direct object ("the book"). Additionally, all words are spelled correctly and punctuation marks are used appropriately.
0	The sentence "Carla slid at the book" is grammatically incorrect because the preposition "at" is used incorrectly here. When someone or something slides, it moves along a surface. Therefore, we need to use the preposition "on" or "over" instead of "at". A corrected version could be: "Carla slid on the book." However, without additional context, this correction may also not make perfect sense since people usually don't slide on books as they are not typically smooth surfaces.
1	The sentence "Amanda carried the package to Pamela" is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple sentence with a subject ("Amanda"), a verb ("carried"), and an object ("the package"). Additionally, it contains a prepositional phrase ("to Pamela") that provides more information about where Amanda took the package. All elements are used correctly, making the sentence grammatically sound.
0	The verb 'drive' requires a subject that can perform the action of driving. In this case, 'packages' is the subject but it cannot drive because packages are inanimate objects. Therefore, the sentence is grammatically incorrect as it stands. A possible correction could be "People easily drive packages to New York" or "Packages are easily delivered to New York by truck."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It consists of a noun ("the chair") and a verb ("pushed"), which expresses that something or someone moved the chair. Since both parts are used correctly, there's no need for correction.
1	The sentence "We offered a job to her." is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "we", which is a plural noun referring to more than one person. The verb "offered" is in the past tense and agrees with the plural subject. The object of the preposition "to" is the pronoun "her". This sentence correctly uses standard English grammar rules for subject-verb agreement and word order.
0	The sentence "A job offered" is missing a subject and verb to form a complete thought. It's unclear who or what is offering the job. To make it grammatically correct, we could add a subject and rephrase the sentence as follows: "Someone offered a job."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Brown," who is performing the action of presenting. The direct object of the sentence is "a plaque," which is what is being presented. Finally, "to Jones" indicates the indirect object of the sentence, or the person receiving the gift. All elements are present and arranged correctly, so the sentence is grammatical.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Carmen," who is performing the action of buying something. The direct object of the sentence is "dress," which is what Carmen is buying for someone else. The indirect object of the sentence is "Mary," who is receiving the dress that Carmen has bought. All of these elements combine to form a complete and coherent sentence.
1	The sentence "Carmen obtained the spare part at the hardware store" is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("Carmen"), a verb ("obtained"), and an object ("the spare part") that expresses a complete thought or action. Additionally, there are no spelling errors, punctuation errors, or misused words in the sentence.
1	The sentence "Michelle kept the desk with the papers" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "Michelle" is a proper noun and serves as the subject of the sentence. * "kept" is the past tense of the verb "keep," which indicates that Michelle performed some action on the object of the sentence. * "the desk" is the direct object of the sentence, meaning it receives the action of the verb. * "with the papers" functions as a prepositional phrase modifying either "desk" or "papers." It tells us something about their relationship to each other (i.e., they were together). Prepositions such as "with" can introduce phrases that modify various parts of a sentence, including its objects.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence, "Frances," is doing the action described by the verb "hid." We know what or who was hidden (the presents) because of the object pronoun "the" which comes before "presents." Finally, we have a prepositional phrase that tells us where the hiding occurred ("in the drawer"). Overall, the structure of the sentence is clear and easy to understand.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It consists of a subject ("the needle"), a verb ("poked") and an object ("the cloth"). Additionally, each word is spelled correctly, punctuation is used appropriately, and there are no awkward or unnatural phrasings.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence, "Carrie," is a proper noun and the singular third-person pronoun is used correctly with it ("touched"). Additionally, the object of the verb, "that cat," is also grammatically correct as it uses a demonstrative determiner before a plural countable noun. Overall, there are no grammatical errors or awkward phrasings in this sentence.
1	The sentence "Herman whipped the sugar and the cream" is grammatically correct. In this sentence, the subject is "Herman," the verb is "whipped," and there are two objects - "the sugar" and "the cream." This structure follows standard English syntax rules for a simple sentence. Additionally, all words are spelled correctly, and punctuation is used appropriately.
1	The sentence "Linda taped the picture to the wall" is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("Linda"), a verb ("taped") that agrees with the subject in number, and an object ("the picture"). Additionally, it includes the preposition "to," which indicates where the action was performed (in this case, on "the wall"). All of these elements form a complete thought, making the sentence grammatically sound.
1	The sentence "Linda taped the picture onto the wall" is grammatically correct. Here's a breakdown of why it works: * "Linda" is the subject of the sentence, referring to the person who performed the action. * "taped" is the verb (past tense), indicating that the action was completed in the past. It agrees with the subject in number (singular) and matches the context of the sentence. * "the picture" serves as the direct object; it receives the action described by the verb. In this case, Linda applied tape to the picture. * "onto" is a preposition showing the relationship between two objects or actions in space and time. Here, it indicates the location where the picture now resides after being taped—on the wall. * "the wall" functions as the indirect object because it answers the question "where?" regarding the destination of the direct object (the picture).
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "The child" is a noun phrase that consists of the definite article "the" followed by the singular noun "child." It functions as the subject of the sentence. * "and" is a coordinating conjunction that connects two elements (in this case, "the child" and "her mother") that have equal grammatical rank. * "Her mother" is another noun phrase that consists of the possessive pronoun "her" followed by the plural noun "mother." It functions as the second element in the coordinate structure initiated by "and." * "clung" is the verb of the sentence, which describes the action performed by both "the child" and "her mother." Since it follows a coordinate structure ("the child and her mother"), we can use the singular form because the subjects share the same verb when they perform the same action. * Together is an adverb modifying how the child and her mother clung to each other.
1	The sentence "This flyer and that flyer differ" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "this flyer and that flyer," which is a compound noun phrase connected by the conjunction "and." The verb "differ" indicates that there is some contrast between the two flyers being discussed. There is no grammatical error or awkward phrasing in this sentence, so it can be labeled as grammatically correct.
0	The word "apart" is incorrect in this context. Instead of saying "differ apart," it should say "differ from each other." The corrected sentence would be: "This flyer and that flyer differ from each other."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. Here's a breakdown of why: * "The jeweler" (American spelling) or "the jeweller" (British spelling) is a singular noun that refers to a person who sells jewelry. It is in its standard form here. * "scribbled" is the past tense and third-person singular form of the verb "to scribble," which means to write carelessly or hastily. In this context, it describes how the subject wrote something. * "the contract" is a countable noun referring to a written agreement between two parties. Since there can be only one unique thing being referred to by "the contract," we know it must be a specific document previously mentioned or understood from the context. * "with his name" tells us what was included along with writing the contract. Specifically, the jeweler added their own signature or identifying information to the document.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The verb "grew" is used correctly to indicate that the gardener caused something (the acorn) to develop or become larger over time. In this case, it means that the acorn was nurtured by the gardener until it became an oak tree.
1	The sentence "I shaped a loaf" is grammatically correct. It consists of a subject ("I"), a verb ("shaped") in past tense form, and an object ("a loaf"). No errors can be found regarding word choice, spelling, or punctuation; therefore, it is a valid English sentence that conveys clear meaning.
0	This sentence is missing a direct object, which is necessary to complete the meaning of the verb "amuse." A corrected version might be "The children amused us," or "The children amused themselves." Without a direct object, it's unclear who or what was being amused.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence, "Susan," is the person who is doing the action (whispering). The verb of the sentence, "whispered," describes the action that the subject is performing. Finally, "the news" is the direct object because it is what Susan whispers to someone else. All of these components work together to form a complete and coherent sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence, "Susan," is performing the action of whispering, which is indicated by the verb. The object of the verb is "Rachel." There is a preposition "at" that indicates where the action was directed. All elements of the sentence have clear roles and functions, so it's grammatically valid.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Ellen," which is a proper noun. The verb is "said" which agrees with the singular subject. The clause "that melons were selling well" is a dependent clause acting as the direct object of the sentence. It contains the plural noun "melons" and the verb phrase "were selling." Both of these elements agree with each other and are used correctly. Overall, there are no grammatical errors or awkward phrasings in this sentence.
0	The sentence is not grammatically complete or clear as it does not specify what "the present conditions" refers to. A more specific object or thought needs to be added after "conditions." For example, a better way to phrase the sentence could be "Ellen commented on the current weather conditions," assuming that was the intended meaning.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Ellen," who is doing the action of warning. The indirect object is "Helen," who receives the warning, while "skating on thin ice" describes what Helen was warned against. Each part plays a clear role in the sentence structure, making it easy to understand and follow.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Cynthia," which is a proper noun referring to a person. The verb is "nibbled," which is in past tense and agrees with the subject. The object of the sentence is "the carrot." There are no grammatical errors or awkward phrasing in this sentence.
1	The sentence "Cynthia chewed" is grammatically correct. It consists of a proper subject ("Cynthia") and a past-tense verb ("chewed"). No grammatical errors or awkward phrasings can be identified.
1	The sentence "Paul laughed at Mary" is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple sentence with a subject (Paul), an auxiliary verb (laughed), and an object (Mary). There are no spelling errors or awkward phrasings, so it receives a score of 1 for grammaticality.
0	The error in this sentence lies in the object of the verb "wink." In standard English, we do not wink our lips; rather, we wink our eye(s). So a corrected version would be "Linda winked her eye" or simply "Linda winked," assuming context makes clear what she winked (e.g., at someone).
0	The verb "pound" requires a direct object to complete its meaning, but in this sentence, there is no noun or pronoun that receives the action of pounding. A corrected version could be "My heart is pounding *in* me," although typically we would simply say "My heart is pounding."
1	The sentence "Sharon fainted from hunger" is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple sentence structure where the subject (Sharon) is followed by the verb (fainted) and the prepositional phrase (from hunger). All words are spelled correctly, and there are no punctuation errors or awkward phrasing. Therefore, I would classify this sentence as being grammatically correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It consists of a subject ("the witch"), an auxiliary verb ("poisoned") that agrees with the subject in number (singular), and an object ("the children"). There are no spelling or punctuation errors, so it meets all the requirements for being a well-formed English sentence.
1	The sentence "A grandfather clock ticked in the hallway" is grammatically correct. Here's a breakdown of why: * "A grandfather clock": This phrase uses the indefinite article "a" before a singular noun to indicate that it refers to any grandfather clock, rather than a specific one. Since "grandfather clock" is a countable noun and we're referring to just one instance of it, using "a" is appropriate. * "ticked": This verb describes the sound made by the clock. It agrees with its subject ("the grandfather clock") in number (singular) and tense (simple past). * "in the hallway": This prepositional phrase indicates where the clock was located when it ticked. It consists of the preposition "in," which takes the noun "hallway" as its object. Overall, each word in the sentence functions appropriately within its grammatical context, making it a correct English sentence.
0	The verb "squeak" typically does not take a direct object; it describes the sound that something makes when it is rubbed or pressed together quickly and lightly. Therefore, saying "I squeezed the door" would be more appropriate if you mean to say that you caused the door to make a squeaking noise by applying pressure or force to it.
1	The sentence "Over the fire there bubbled a fragrant stew." is grammatically correct. Here's why: * The subject of the sentence is "a fragrant stew," which is modified by the adjective "fragrant" to describe what kind of stew it is. * The verb phrase is "bubbled over the fire," where "bubbled" is the past tense of the verb "to bubble" that describes the action taken by the subject, and "over the fire" is a prepositional phrase indicating where the action took place. * Overall, the sentence has a clear structure, appropriate word choice, and proper grammar usage.
1	The sentence "Soaring temperatures are predicted for this weekend." is grammatically correct. Here's why: - The subject of the sentence is "temperatures," which is a plural noun that agrees with the verb "are predicted." - The verb tense used is future tense, indicated by "are predicted" to describe something that will happen in the future (this weekend). - The adjective "soaring" describes the temperature, indicating it will be very high. - The prepositional phrase "for this weekend" provides additional information about when the soaring temperatures will occur.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. There is a subject ("the fort"), a verb ("fluttered"), and a modifying phrase ("with many flags"). The word "fluttered" correctly agrees with its singular subject "fort." Additionally, the preposition "with" introduces a prepositional phrase that describes how or why the fort was fluttering. Overall, there are no errors in grammar, usage, or mechanics in this sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple declarative sentence with a subject ("the voices") and a verb ("echoed"). Additionally, it contains a prepositional phrase that modifies the noun ("in the hall"). All elements fit together well to form a coherent thought, making for a proper English sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("the stream") and a verb ("twists"), which agree in number (singular). Additionally, the phrase "through the valley" functions as an adverbial complement, providing information about where or how the action of the verb takes place. Overall, the structure and syntax of the sentence are clear and unambiguous.
0	The past tense of the verb "present" is "presented," but it needs to be followed by the word "itself." However, there is no noun or pronoun that has been presented beforehand for "itself" to refer back to. A better way to phrase this sentence would be "A wonderful opportunity presented itself yesterday."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "a wonderful opportunity," which is singular. The verb that agrees with a singular subject is "presented." Therefore, the verb tense is consistent with the subject-verb agreement rule. Additionally, the time expression "yesterday" provides clear context for when the event occurred. Overall, the sentence is well-structured and understandable.
1	The sentence "Out of the box jumped a little white rabbit." is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("a little white rabbit"), a verb tense that indicates past action ("jumped"), and a prepositional phrase that modifies the verb ("out of the box"). All elements of the sentence work together to convey a complete thought, making it a well-formed sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Penny," which is a noun that refers to a person (a girl's name). The verb is "skated" which agrees with the singular subject "Penny." The preposition "around" introduces the location where Penny was skating. Finally, the noun phrase "the rink" functions as the object of the preposition "around." Overall, this sentence has a clear structure and proper word usage.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Jackie," who is performing the action indicated by the verb "accompanied." The object of the sentence is "Rose," who is receiving the action of being accompanied. Both the subject and object are clearly identified, and there are no grammatical errors or awkward phrasing in the sentence. Therefore, it can be considered a well-formed English sentence.
0	The verb "was" does not agree with its subject "many information." In this case, the subject is plural ("information") so the verb should also be plural ("were"). A corrected version of the sentence would read: "Many pieces of information were provided."
0	The word "advice" is uncountable, so it should be used with a singular verb. Therefore, the correct form of the sentence would be "John offers much advice." Alternatively, if "advice" is being used to mean individual pieces of advice, it could be made countable (e.g., "John offers many advices"), but this usage is less common and might be considered incorrect in formal writing.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It uses a comparative structure ("more delicious") to compare two things (the cakes that Jones and Smith got), which is followed by a clause indicating what they are being compared to (the one that Smith got). Additionally, the verb tense is consistent throughout the sentence, making it easy to understand and follow.
0	The sentence contains a minor error in its verb agreement. The subject of the sentence is "we," which is plural. However, the verb "recommend" is in its singular form. To fix this issue, change "recommend" to "recommends." A corrected version would be: "We recommend eating less cake and pastry."
1	The sentence “I saw that gas can explode” is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is “I,” which is the person performing the action. The verb is “saw,” indicating past tense. The object is “that gas can explode,” which functions as a noun clause acting as the direct object of the sentence. This means that the speaker witnessed a situation where gas could potentially explode. Overall, the structure of the sentence is clear and coherent, making it grammatically sound.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "he," a singular third-person pronoun. The verb "washed" agrees with the subject in number (singular) and person (third). The object of the sentence is "her," another third-personal pronoun. There are no grammatical errors or awkward phrasings that would detract from the clarity or meaning of the sentence.
0	The verb 'wash' needs to be followed by a direct object indicating what is being washed. In this case, it seems that the speaker intended for 'you' to be the subject of the sentence, but grammatically it appears as if 'you' is being used as the direct object instead. A better way to phrase this would be "Wash yourself!" or "I will wash you."
0	The sentence "They have no in" is grammatically incorrect because it lacks a complete thought or predicate verb that specifies what the subject (they) does not possess. A corrected version could be "They have no idea," which includes a noun phrase ("an idea") to complete the meaning of the sentence.
0	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in this sentence. The verb "are" does not agree with its plural subject "some of my jobs." It should be "Some of my job**s** are in jeopardy" or simply "My jobs are in jeopardy," depending on what the speaker intends to convey.
0	The verb tense does not agree with the subject of the sentence. In the first part of the sentence, the past tense ("was") is used, but in the second part, the present tense ("met") is used. Additionally, there should be a relative pronoun such as "who" or "that" between "the policeman" and "met." A corrected version would read: "It was the policeman who met several young students in the park last night."
0	The sentence "did the policeman meet in the park?" is grammatically incorrect because it lacks a proper question word to begin the interrogative sentence. A more appropriate way to phrase the sentence would be "Did the policeman meet someone in the park?" or "Did the policaman have a meeting in the park?"
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "John," which is a proper noun and the person performing the action. The verb or predicate is "put," which indicates what John is doing to something else. The direct object is "old books," which tells us what John is putting. Finally, we have the prepositional phrase "in the box" that gives more information about where John placed the old books. All parts of speech are used correctly and there is no awkward phrasing, so I would rate this sentence as grammatically correct.
0	This sentence is missing a verb. A correct version could be "The monkeys are proud of their leader." or "The monkeys were proud of their leader." In its current form, it's grammatically incomplete.
0	The sentence "John sounded very" is grammatically incomplete as it lacks a complement to describe what exactly John sounded like or how he sounded (e.g., "John sounded very loud," "John sounded very tired"). Therefore, it requires revision for proper grammatical structure.
1	The sentence "I don't know if I should agree" is grammatically correct. It consists of a complete thought expressing uncertainty about making an agreement. There are no spelling errors or incorrect word usage that would make it unacceptable in standard English.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence, "John," is doing the action indicated by the verb, "bought." Additionally, we have a direct object, "a book," which tells us what John bought. Finally, there's a prepositional phrase, "on the table," that gives more information about where the action took place. All these elements together form a complete and coherent sentence without any grammatical errors.
1	The sentence "John called the president a fool" is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("John"), a verb ("called") that agrees with the subject in number, and a direct object ("the president"). Additionally, it includes an adjective ("fool") to describe the noun phrase "the president." All of these elements form a complete thought, making this a complete sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "I," which is the person who forgot something. The verb is "forgot," which indicates past tense. The object of the sentence is "how good beer tastes." This phrase functions as the direct object because it answers the question "What did you forget?" In addition, the word order follows standard English syntax rules, making this a complete and coherent sentence.
1	The sentence "This teacher is a genius" is grammatically correct. It consists of a subject ("this teacher") and a predicate ("is a genius"). Both the subject and predicate contain appropriate words that agree in number (singular) and tense (present). Additionally, there are no spelling errors or missing punctuation marks in the sentence. Therefore, it can be considered as a valid and proper English statement.
0	The verb tense used in this sentence is incorrect. In standard English, we would say "A good friend remains to me by him," but even that sentence sounds awkward because it's unclear what "by him" means in this context. It might be better to rephrase the entire sentence to avoid confusion. For example: "He has remained a good friend to me."
1	The sentence "John ate his noodle quietly" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "John" is a proper noun that serves as the subject of the sentence. It agrees with the verb in number (singular) and person (third). * "ate" is the simple past tense form of the verb "eat," which indicates completed action in the past. This verb agrees with the singular subject "John." * "his" is a possessive determiner that shows ownership or association between the subject "John" and the object "noodle." * "noodle" is a countable noun that refers to a type of food. * "quietly" is an adverb that describes how John performed the action of eating. Overall, all elements of the sentence agree in number, gender, and meaning. Therefore, it is grammatically correct.
1	The sentence "A smith hammered the metal" is grammatically correct. Here's a breakdown of why it works: * "A smith" is a singular noun phrase that refers to a person who makes things out of metal. It uses the indefinite article "a", which indicates that we are introducing a new entity into the conversation or text. * "hammered" is the past tense of the verb "to hammer". In this context, it means that the smith used forceful blows to shape the metal. * "the metal" is a definite noun phrase that refers to a specific piece of metal that was being shaped by the smith. The use of the definite article "the" signals that the reader already knows which metal is being referred to. Overall, the sentence has a clear subject ("A smith"), a predicate ("hammered the metal") that describes what the subject did, and proper use of articles before both noun phrases. Therefore, I would label this as a grammatically correct sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence, "Sandy," is singular, so the verb must also be singular. In this case, "removed" is the past tense of the verb "remove," which agrees with the singular subject "Sandy." Additionally, the object of the sentence, "her ballet shoes," is possessive and correctly uses the possessive determiner "her" to indicate ownership of the noun phrase "ballet shoes." Overall, there are no grammatical errors or awkward phrasings in this sentence.
1	The sentence "This week will be a difficult one for us." is grammatically correct. Here's why: - "This" refers to a specific week that has been mentioned or implied beforehand. It could also refer to the current week without any prior mention since it is commonly used as a demonstrative pronoun. - "week" is a noun referring to seven consecutive days starting from Sunday (or Monday depending on regional conventions). - "will be" indicates future tense, showing that something is expected to happen later. - "a difficult one" modifies the word "week," indicating its quality or characteristics. - "for us" shows who is affected by the difficulty of the week. Therefore, all elements are well-constructed, making the whole sentence grammatically correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence, "Benny," is clearly identified. The verb tense is consistent throughout the sentence ("worked" indicates past tense), and the prepositional phrase "in a shoe factory" gives necessary context for where Benny worked. Additionally, there is no punctuation or spelling errors present in the sentence.
1	The sentence "Everyone hoped that she would sing" is grammatically correct. Here's a breakdown of why it works: * "Everyone" serves as the subject of the sentence, indicating all individuals involved in the situation. * "hoped" functions as the verb, expressing what everyone collectively felt or desired. * "that" introduces a subordinate clause, which contains additional information about the main clause (everyone hoping). * "she" acts as the object of the verb "hoped," specifying who was being anticipated to perform an action. * "would sing" represents the infinitive phrase acting as the predicate for "she." It indicates her expected future action.
1	The sentence "This proved a decisive factor" is grammatically correct. It consists of a noun phrase ("this") followed by a verb ("proved") in past tense, and another noun phrase ("a decisive factor"). There are no spelling or grammatical errors in the sentence, so it can be considered to be correctly written.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("the crocodile"), a verb ("devoured") and an object ("the doughnut"). There are no spelling or punctuation errors either.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "John," who is modified by the adjective "afraid." The verb is "is," which agrees with the singular subject "John" in number. The object of the preposition "of" is "Bill." There are no grammatical errors or awkward phrasings in this sentence.
0	The sentence "John put under the bathtub" is incorrect because it lacks a direct object for the verb "put." A more complete version of the sentence would be something like "John put the mat under the bathtub," where "the mat" serves as the direct object. Without a direct object, the sentence is grammatically incomplete.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "John," who is performing the action of placing something or someone (in this case, "Kim") in a specific location ("behind the garage"). Both proper nouns are capitalized correctly, and the verb agrees with the number of the subject. Additionally, prepositional phrase "behind the garage" provides more information about where Kim was placed.
0	The verb 'depends' requires a preposition such as 'on' to follow it when used transitively (i.e., when followed by an object). Therefore, the correct form of the sentence would be "Kim depends on Sandy."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence, "John," is the person performing the action described by the verb, "put." The direct object of the sentence, "the book," receives the action of the verb. Finally, "in the box" describes where the action took place, making it a prepositional phrase that modifies the verb. Overall, each part of the sentence has a clear role and contributes to the meaning of the sentence as a whole.
1	The sentence "John taught English Syntax to new students." is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "John" is a proper noun that serves as the subject of the sentence. It is correctly capitalized. * "taught" is the past tense of the verb "teach," which agrees with the subject "John." * "English Syntax" functions as the direct object of the sentence, receiving the action of being taught by John. Both words are capitalized because they refer to specific subjects within academia (a language and a field of study). * "to" introduces the prepositional phrase "to new students," indicating the recipients of John's teaching. Preposition usage is appropriate here. * "new students" is another plural noun functioning as the indirect object of the sentence, showing who received the instruction from John.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "John," who is doing the regarding. The verb is "regards" which is conjugated correctly for the third-person singular subject. The object of the verb is "Bill." We know that "Bill" is being regarded as something because of the preposition "as," followed by the noun phrase "a good friend." All elements fit together well to form a complete thought.
1	The sentence "Kim put in the box" is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple sentence with a subject ("Kim") and a verb ("put"). Additionally, there is a prepositional phrase that functions as an adverbial of place ("in the box"), providing more information about where the action took place. Overall, each word has been used correctly, so no corrections need to be made.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "the chickens," which is plural. The verb "seem" agrees with the plural subject, as do the pronouns "they" or "them" if they were used later in the sentence. Additionally, the prepositional phrase "of the farmer" correctly modifies the verb to show what the chickens are fond of. Overall, there are no grammatical errors in this sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "the rules," which requires a plural verb form. In this case, "require" is used correctly as the verb because it matches the plural subject. Additionally, the prepositional phrase "to the executives" modifies the noun "executives." It uses the proper preposition "to" followed by the objective form of the noun, indicating direction or recipient. Therefore, I would rate this sentence as grammatically correct.
0	The verb tense used in the first part of the sentence ("That Fred was unpopular") does not agree with the verb tense used in the second part of the sentence ("nominated"). Additionally, there should be a conjunction (such as "and" or "so") connecting the two clauses. A corrected version might read: "Fred was unpopular, so he was nominated by Bill."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It uses the present continuous tense (were taking) to indicate that the action of looking was happening at a specific point in the past. The phrase "at possible FTA" is also correct because it indicates they were examining potential free trade agreements.
0	The preposition "against" does not fit well in this context. It seems that the speaker wants to express that John gave them money for a book. In such cases, we usually use the prepositions "for" or "towards." Hence, the corrected version could be either "John paid me for the book" or "John paid towards the book," depending on what exactly was meant by it.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "the committee," which is a plural noun taking a singular verb ("will study") because it refers to a single group acting as a unit. The infinitive phrase "setting up" functions as the direct object of the verb "study." Finally, the prepositional phrases "of the feasibility" and "of a national computer network" modify the verb by telling what the committee will study and providing additional information about that topic, respectively. All elements of the sentence function correctly within their syntactic roles, making the sentence grammatical.
0	The verb "made" is a transitive verb that requires an object to complete its meaning. In this case, the pronoun "them" serves as the direct object of the verb "made." However, there is no need for another auxiliary verb such as "be" after "made." Therefore, the sentence "We made them be rude" is grammatically incorrect. A correct version would simply be "We made them rude."
1	The sentence "After reading the pamphlet, Judy threw it into the garbage can." is grammatically correct. There are no spelling errors or misplaced words. Additionally, the sentence follows a logical order and has appropriate verb tense agreement.
0	The verb "studying" should agree with its subject "Students," but it is incorrectly modified by the present participle phrase "while at university." Instead, use the past tense form "read" to indicate that the action occurred in the past. A correct version would be: "Students studied Conrad's Heart of Darkness while they were at university."
1	The sentence "I read some of the book" is grammatically correct. The subject "I" is followed by a verb tense that indicates past action ("read"), and there is a proper use of an article ("the") before a singular noun ("book"). Additionally, "some of the book" correctly shows a specific part being referred to from the whole entity. Overall, it's a well-structured sentence without any errors or awkward constructions.
1	The sentence "Most of the fruit is rotten" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "Most" is a determiner that indicates quantity or extent. It modifies the noun phrase "the fruit." * "Of" is a preposition indicating relationship or possession. In this case, it shows that most of the fruit (not all) has some kind of relationship to what follows. * "The" is a definite article used before singular countable nouns when referring to something specific. * "Fruit" is a plural noun referring to the edible part of plants. * "Is" is a linking verb connecting the subject ("most of the fruit") to its complement ("rotten"). * "Rotten" is an adjective describing the state or condition of the fruit.
0	The sentence contains a double negative, which can lead to confusion about the intended meaning. To convey that neither student performed poorly, it's better to say, "Both students succeeded" or "Neither of the students failed." Adding "the" before "students" makes the statement clearer and grammatically correct.
0	In this sentence, the error occurs with the word "some." It's incorrect to say "some of water" because we need a determiner before "water," such as "the" or "a." The corrected version would be "I drank some of the water" or "I drank some water."
0	The noun "hair" should be plural in this context because it refers to individual strands coming from someone's head rather than a single piece of hair. Additionally, there is no article ("a", "an", or "the") needed before "golden." A better way to phrase the statement would be: "It is golden hair." Alternatively, if only one strand was meant, we could say "It is a gold **hair**," where "*hair*" is singular and "*gold*" functions as an adjective describing the color.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence ("the boy") is clear, and the verb tense is consistent throughout (past tense). Additionally, the prepositional phrase "in the doorway" provides necessary context for understanding which boy is being referred to. Overall, there are no errors in grammar or usage that would require correction.
1	The sentence "That dog is so ferocious, it even tried to bite itself." is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "that dog," which is singular, so the verb "is" agrees with the subject. Additionally, the reflexive pronoun "itself" correctly refers back to the antecedent "dog." Overall, there are no grammatical errors or awkward phrasing that would require correction.
0	The verb 'wash' requires an object to complete its meaning, but 'yourself' is a reflexive pronoun that already includes the idea of an object within itself (i.e., oneself). Therefore, using both together creates redundancy and results in incorrect grammar. A correct version would be either 'He washed himself' or 'He washed you.'
0	The sentence contains a grammatical error known as a dangling modifier. In this case, "easy to please" is intended to modify "Kim," but it's actually closer to "John." To fix this error, we could say "John is easy to please; just ask Kim." or "Kim is easily pleased by John."
0	The sentence "There seemed to be intelligent" is grammatically incorrect because it lacks a noun or pronoun after the verb "be." A more appropriate way to phrase the sentence could be "There seemed to be intelligence," assuming that the intended meaning of the original sentence was referring to some form of intelligence as a quality or ability possessed by someone or something unspecified.
1	The sentence "John tried to please Stephen" is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple tense verb phrase ("tried") followed by an infinitive phrase ("to please Stephen"). Both the subject ("John") and the object ("Stephen") are clear and correctly placed within the sentence. There are no spelling or punctuation errors present. Therefore, I would classify this as a correct sentence.
0	This sentence is grammatically incorrect because of the word 'fountain'. The phrase 'believed John to be' indicates that what follows will be a noun clause acting as the direct object of the verb 'believed', which requires a subject and predicate within it. A 'fountain' can function as a noun but here, due to contextual absurdity, we understand that the intended meaning was likely 'John to be a gardener (or similar) who tends to the fountain in the park.' However, without rephrasing or additional information for clarification, the current structure does not make logical sense.
0	The verb "tries" is present tense third person singular, which requires a subject that also has third person singular agreement (e.g., he, she, it). In this case, the subject of the sentence is "it," so grammatically, there's no issue here. However, using the pronoun "it" without specifying what "it" refers to can create confusion for readers as they may not know what or who "it" is referring to. For clarity and better writing, consider rephrasing the sentence by explicitly stating what "it" represents.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "John," which is a noun in the third person singular form. The verb "tries" agrees with the subject because it is also in the third person singular form (base form + 's'). The infinitive phrase "to leave the country" functions as the direct object of the sentence. Therefore, there are no grammatical errors in this sentence.
1	The sentence "Under the bed seems to be a fun place to hide" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "Under the bed" functions as an adverbial phrase of location, modifying where the action (hiding) takes place. It uses the preposition "under" followed by the article "the" and the noun "bed." This structure is common and acceptable in English. * The verb "seems" indicates that the subject ("place") appears or gives the impression of being something specific - in this case, a fun place to hide. * "To be" serves as a linking verb connecting the subject ("place") with its complement ("a fun place to hide"). Both parts agree in number and tense. * Finally, "a fun place to hide" is a predicate nominative, providing additional information about the subject. Using the indefinite article "a" before "fun" is appropriate here because it refers to any such place rather than a particular one.
0	The verb "is" should be used instead of "to be" because the subject "there" is singular. Also, "sheep" should be pluralized as "sheeps" when we use it with a determiner like "some." However, "sheep" can function as both a plural and uncountable noun without a determiner (e.g., "Sheep graze on the hills"). In this case, though, since there's a determiner ("there is believed to be"), the plural form is needed. So the corrected sentence would read: "There are believed to be sheep in the park," or better yet, "It is believed that there are sheep in the park."
0	The verb tense used in this sentence is incorrect. Instead of saying "I hope to would study," it should be either "I hope to study" (present tense) or "I hoped to study" (past tense). Therefore, the corrected sentence could be either "I hope to study in France" or "I hoped to study in France."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence, "John," is a proper noun and the singular third-person pronoun is used correctly with the verb "can." Additionally, the direct object of the sentence, "the ball," follows the transitive verb "kick" appropriately.
0	The verb "rain" is an intransitive verb that doesn't take a subject as its direct object. Instead, it requires a weather subject such as "it." Therefore, the correct sentence would be "It will rain tomorrow," or "John will get rained on tomorrow."
0	The verb tense is incorrect in this sentence. Instead of "expect there to **will** rain," it should be "expect there **to be** rain." In addition, a more natural way to phrase this would be "We expect it to rain" or "It's expected to rain."
1	The sentence "John was found in the office" is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("John"), a helping verb ("was") that agrees with the singular subject, a past participle verb form ("found"), and a prepositional phrase ("in the office") indicating location. All of these elements combine to create a complete thought or independent clause. Therefore, there are no errors in grammar, syntax, word usage, or punctuation.
0	The verb tense used in this question is incorrect. In English, we use the simple past tense to describe a completed action in the past, such as "The child was in the school." Alternatively, if we want to ask about a present state or condition, we would say "Does the child be in the school?" instead of "Did the child be in the school?" However, even though the latter formulation is grammatically possible, it's less common than using the auxiliary verb "is" for questions about present states or conditions. So, the corrected version of this sentence could be either "Was the child in the school?" (to refer to a past event) or "Is the child in the school?" (to refer to the present).
1	The sentence "It did not rain" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "it," which is used as a dummy subject to form a weather verb construction. The negation "not" correctly follows the auxiliary verb "did." Finally, the past tense verb "rain" completes the sentence. Therefore, there are no grammatical errors in this sentence.
0	The sentence contains a double negative ("not" and "never"), which can make it unclear what the intended meaning is. It would be better to rephrase the sentence using only one negative, such as "John doesn't want to leave the town." or "John wants to stay in the town."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It has a clear subject ("Mary") and verb ("likes") for each clause, and uses appropriate punctuation (a comma followed by a conjunction) to separate them. Additionally, the verb forms used appropriately reflect the subjects' attitudes towards the activity of touring art galleries.
1	The sentence "They needn't take this exam" is grammatically correct. The word "needn't" is a contraction of "do not need," which functions as a negator here. It indicates that taking the exam is unnecessary or optional for them. Therefore, there is no mistake in this sentence.
1	The sentence "Ann may spend her vacation in Italy" is grammatically correct. Here's a breakdown of why it works: * "Ann" is a proper noun (a name) that serves as the subject of the sentence. It is correctly capitalized. * "may spend" indicates possibility or permission, which fits the context since it refers to where someone might go on vacation. * "her" is a possessive pronoun indicating ownership, referring to Ann in this case. * "vacation" is a noun representing a period of time spent away from home or business for pleasure. * "in" shows spatial relationship, implying that Italy is the location of Ann's vacation. * "Italy" is another proper noun, denoting a country in southern Europe. Since it begins with a capital letter, there is no error here either.
1	The sentence "They love to play golf, but I do not." is grammatically correct. In the first clause, "they" is a plural subject that agrees with the verb phrase "love to play," which is also in the present tense. Similarly, in the second clause, "I" is a singular subject that agrees with the verb "do not," which is used here as a negator for the verb phrase "do like to play golf." Therefore, there are no grammatical errors in this sentence.
1	The sentence "George has spent a lot of money, hasn't he?" is grammatically correct. It is a question that uses subject-auxiliary inversion ("has spent" instead of "spent") followed by a tag question to confirm or check understanding.
0	The sentence contains an error in verb tense agreement. The past simple form of the verb "can" is "could," which agrees with the subject "he." However, using "scarcely could" creates a negative meaning that implies it was difficult for him to do anything worth mentioning. A better way to phrase the sentence while maintaining the intended meaning would be "As a statesman, he scarcely did anything worth mentioning." Alternatively, if one wants to maintain the original structure but fix the verb tense agreement issue, they can say "Scarce(ly) had he done anything worth mentioning as a statesman."
1	The sentence "We never found any of the unicorns" is grammatically correct. Here's a breakdown: * "We" is a subject pronoun. * "never" is an adverb modifying the verb phrase "found." * "found" is the past tense of the verb "find," indicating that the action took place in the past. It agrees with the subject "we." * "any" is a determiner used to refer to an unknown or unspecified amount or number. In this case, it refers to an unspecified number of unicorns. * "of the unicorns" is a prepositional phrase specifying which unicorns were being searched for. It consists of the preposition "of," followed by the definite article "the," and the noun "unicorns." The sentence has a clear structure, appropriate word choice, and proper use of grammar rules. Therefore, I would rate it as 1 (correct).
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no spelling errors or punctuation marks missing. Additionally, the structure of the sentence is clear and easy to understand. Therefore, I would rate it as correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no spelling errors or punctuation marks missing. Additionally, the word order follows standard English syntax rules. Furthermore, the use of tenses is consistent throughout the sentence - "somebody" (subject) "struck" (past tense verb) the "unidentified victim" (object). Finally, there is a clear time reference provided for when the action took place - "during the early morning hours".
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It consists of a noun phrase ("the car") and a verb phrase ("was driven"). The past tense "was driven" indicates that the action occurred in the past. Additionally, subject-verb agreement is maintained since both parts of the sentence match in number (singular).
1	The sentence "Ricky can be relied on" is grammatically correct. Here, "can be relied on" is a present passive construction that functions as an adjectival phrase modifying the noun "Ricky." It means that Ricky has the quality or characteristic of being reliable, so there's no mistake here.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The past participle of the verb "sleep" can be used as an adjective to describe the state of the bed after someone has slept in it.
0	The verb tense used in this sentence does not make logical sense. The past tense of the verb "weigh" would be "weighed," which suggests that the action occurred entirely in the past. However, something cannot be weighed (past tense) "by the book." It might have made more sense if the present participle form of the verb ("weighing") were used instead, but even then, it's unclear what exactly is being measured or compared to a book. So, without further context, I assume this sentence is incorrect as written.
1	The sentence "Who do you think Tom saw?" is grammatically correct. It is a question asking about the object of Tom's observation. The word order follows the rules for subject-auxiliary verb inversion in questions. Therefore, I would return 1 to indicate that the sentence is correct.
1	The sentence "he had spent five thousand dollars" is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple past perfect tense verb phrase ("had spent") and a noun phrase ("five thousand dollars"). The subject-verb agreement is also correct, as "he" is singular and "had spent" is a singular form of the past perfect tense. Therefore, I would classify this sentence as being grammatically accurate.
0	The pronouns used in this sentence do not agree. It's unclear who "her" refers to because there's no clear female antecedent mentioned earlier in the sentence. Additionally, since we don't know if "Fed" is a male or female name, it would be better to use gender-neutral language such as "they" instead of "he" or "she." A corrected version could read: "Fed knows which politician they should vote for."
0	The sentence contains a grammatical error known as a pronoun reference problem. Specifically, it's unclear who the subject of the sentence is - "he" could refer to anyone, so we don't know for sure who fixed the computer. A corrected version might be something like "John fixed the computer," or another name or clearer description could replace "he."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It uses a clause ("whose efforts to achieve peace") as the object of the preposition "of" within the larger noun phrase "the world's honoring of whose efforts." While it may be challenging to understand who exactly the pronoun "whose" refers to without more context, that does not make the sentence incorrect from a grammatical standpoint.
0	The verb "does" must agree with the subject "your friend," which is plural. Therefore, the sentence should read, "Which houses do your friends live in?" or "Which house does your friend live in?" depending on whether the person being referred to has one or multiple residences.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The relative pronoun "whom" is used correctly to introduce a relative clause modifying the noun phrase "the baker." The verb tense is also consistent throughout the sentence, with past tense verbs ("bought," "left") indicating completed actions in the past. Additionally, there are no punctuation or spelling errors in the sentence.
1	The sentence "I found the place where we can relax." is grammatically correct. It has a clear subject ("I"), verb ("found"), and object ("the place"). Additionally, it uses proper punctuation and capitalization. Therefore, there are no errors to correct.
0	The phrase "with whom" creates a redundancy in this sentence because it already includes "with." A corrected version would be "Jack is the person Jenny fell in love with" or "Jenny fell in love with Jack," depending on the intended meaning of the original sentence.
1	The sentence "There is a bench to sit on" is grammatically correct. It has a subject ("there"), a linking verb ("is"), and a predicate noun phrase ("a bench to sit on"). Although some people might prefer to say "a bench **for** sitting on," both versions of the phrase are commonly used and widely accepted as standard English.
1	The sentence "I met the man who grows peaches" is grammatically correct. Here's a breakdown of why it works: * "I met" is in the past tense and indicates that the speaker had an encounter with someone in the past. * "the man" refers to a specific male individual known to both the speaker and listener. * "who" introduces a relative clause modifying "the man." It signals that what follows will provide additional information about him. * "grows peaches" completes the relative clause by describing the man as someone who cultivates peaches. This phrase uses the present tense correctly since it describes the ongoing nature of his occupation or hobby.
0	The sentence contains a minor error in subject-verb agreement. The subject of the sentence is "you," which requires a singular verb form. In this case, "did" is already the correct form for past tense of "do." However, the phrase "without getting his approval" functions as a participial phrase modifying "you." When we remove that phrase to clarify the subject, it becomes clear that there's still something missing: "[You] chose...?" We need to add what was chosen to make the sentence complete. A corrected version could be: "Which topic did you choose without getting his approval?" or "Without getting his approval, you chose which topic?"
0	The sentence contains a pronoun error. It should be "you" instead of "Mary." Here's the corrected version: "Which topic did you get bored because he or she talked about?" Or better yet: "What topic made you feel bored because the person talking wouldn't stop discussing it?"
1	The sentence "That is the reason why he resigned" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "that," which refers to something previously mentioned or understood. "Is" is a linking verb that connects the subject to its complement, "the reason." "Why" introduces a dependent clause that provides additional information about the reason for his resignation. Finally, "he resigned" is the predicate of the sentence, consisting of the subject pronoun "he" and the past tense verb "resigned." Therefore, there are no grammatical errors in this sentence.
1	The sentence "It bothers me that John coughs" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "it," which refers to the situation or fact that John's coughing is bothering someone (in this case, the speaker). The verb "bothers" agrees with its singular subject, and the subordinate clause "that John coughs" provides additional information about what is causing the annoyance. Overall, the sentence has a clear structure and follows standard English grammar rules.
0	The verb "to please" should be followed by a subject complement (a noun or adjective that describes or identifies the subject), rather than an object ("John"). Therefore, the grammatically correct form of this sentence would be "John is easy to please."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Kim," who is described as being eager using the adjective "eager." The infinitive phrase "to please Tom" functions as the direct object of the sentence, telling us what or whom Kim is eager to do something for (in this case, please Tom). Both the grammar and syntax are correct here!
1	The sentence "That we invaded Iraq really bites." is grammatically correct. Here, "that" is a conjunction used to introduce a subordinate clause, "we invaded Iraq" is the subject of the sentence, and "really bites" is the verb phrase expressing emotion or judgment about the action. Therefore, I would give it a score of 1 for being grammatically correct.
0	The sentence "It annoys me that Fido barks" contains a grammatical error. In this sentence, the subject of the clause following "that" should be in the nominative case. Therefore, the correct form of the pronoun "it" should be used instead of "Fido," which is in the accusative case. A corrected version of the sentence would read: "It annoys me that he (Fido) barks."
1	The sentence "Who achieved the best result was Angela." is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is a relative clause ("who achieved the best result") which modifies the noun phrase "the one who achieved the best result". This noun phrase functions as the subject of the sentence, and it agrees with the verb "was" in number (singular). Therefore, there are no grammatical errors in this sentence.
1	The sentence "It was the peasant girl who got it." is grammatically correct. Here's a breakdown of why: - "It" serves as a pronoun referring to something previously mentioned or implied. In this case, we can assume that there was some context provided beforehand that necessitated using "it". - "was" is an auxiliary verb used here for past tense and passive voice. - "the peasant girl" is a noun phrase serving as the subject complement of the sentence. "Peasant girl" functions as a compound adjective modifying "girl", while "the" is a definite article indicating a specific instance of a peasant girl. - "who" introduces a relative clause, which provides additional information about the antecedent ("peasant girl"). - "got" is the main verb in the sentence, conjugated in the simple past tense form. - "it" is the direct object of the verb "got". Overall, all elements within the sentence function appropriately according to their roles, making the sentence grammatically sound.
0	The sentence contains a couple of errors. First, it uses the plural form of the noun ("people") but pairs it with the singular pronoun ("anyone"). Second, there's redundancy in using both "kind" and "type". Here's a corrected version: "That type of person is hard to find anyone to take care of." However, even this revised sentence isn't ideal because we usually use "to find someone who can..." instead of "to find someone to...". So, a more natural way to phrase it would be: "It's hard to find someone who can take care of such a person."
1	The sentence "A sick owl doesn't hunt mice" is grammatically correct. It follows the standard structure of a simple declarative sentence, consisting of a subject ("a sick owls"), an auxiliary verb ("doesn't"), and an object complement ("hunt mice"). Additionally, all words are spelled correctly, and there are no punctuation errors or awkward phrasings that might suggest a grammatical issue. Overall, the sentence conveys its intended meaning clearly and effectively, making it a valid example of proper English usage.
1	The sentence appears grammatically correct. It uses appropriate verb tense ("will be admitted"), a clear subject ("each candidate"), and proper prepositions ("of"). Additionally, the wording effectively conveys its intended meaning that all candidates expressing interest in semantics will gain admission to the department. Therefore, it receives a score of 1 for being grammatically sound.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. Each author's contribution that is written in a language other than English will indeed provide a summary in English, as stated.
0	The sentence contains a minor error in verb tense agreement. The word 'got' should be changed to 'get' to match the present tense of the first part of the sentence ("we even get"). A corrected version would read: "I'm sure we even get these tickets!"
0	The sentence contains a contraction error. It should be "I'm not even sure if/whether we have gotten these tickets" instead of "I'm even sure we got these tickets." The use of "even" before "sure" is also unnecessary as it doesn't add any meaning to the sentence. Additionally, the past tense "gotten" may sound awkward to some speakers; using "have gotten" or simply "got" would be more common.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There is a clear subject ("I"), verb ("helped"), and object ("him"). Additionally, the subordinating conjunction "that" introduces a clause which modifies the reason why the action of helping was done. Overall, there are no grammatical errors or awkward phrasings in this sentence.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The clause "It isn't because Sue said anything bad about me" sets up a reason for something, which is completed by the second independent clause "that I'm angry." This structure is called a complex sentence, where one clause cannot stand alone without the other. Both clauses contain subjects ("it" and "I") and verbs ("isn't" and "am"), so they can both function independently as complete thoughts while still being connected to form a single sentence. Additionally, there are no spelling, punctuation, or word usage errors.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It contains two independent clauses connected by a comma followed by the conjunction "and." The first clause is "That he was hungry," which functions as a noun clause acting as the subject of the second clause, "John whined." A comma is used to separate the two clauses because they are both complete thoughts that could stand alone as individual sentences if necessary (although it's more common for the first clause to be a dependent clause instead). In addition, there is no punctuation error or misspelled word in the sentence.
0	The sentence contains two issues related to word order. In English grammar, when we give someone something, the verb "give" should be followed by the indirect object (the person receiving the item) and then the direct object (the thing being given). Therefore, the corrected version of the sentence would be: "I gave Mary a book after the party."
0	The second part of the sentence after the conjunction 'as for' should be a complete clause or phrase. Here, it seems that there is only half a clause ('I really like her'). A more grammatically correct way to express this idea would be: "Because she's so pleasant, as for Mary, I really like her." However, even with this revision, the sentence may still sound awkward and unnatural. It might be better to say something like: "She's so pleasant; I really like Mary."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are two independent clauses joined by the conjunction "but," which shows a contrast between them. Both clauses contain a subject ("he" and "it") and a verb phrase ("may hate" and "doesn't matter"). Additionally, there is no missing punctuation or misspelled words. Therefore, the sentence is acceptable in standard English grammar.
0	The sentence contains a mistake related to subject-verb agreement. In this case, "would" agrees with the singular noun "John," but the phrase "with no job" requires a plural verb because it refers to jobs. A corrected version of the sentence might read, "Without a job, John wouldn't be happy."
0	The correct phrase is "much of the manuscript remains to be typed," not "left to type." The word "left" implies that it has already been done or completed, whereas "remains to be done" means there is still work to do.
1	The sentence "He's a more reliable man" is grammatically correct. Here, we have a contraction ("he's") followed by a comparative adjective ("more reliable"). This structure indicates that the subject (he) has a higher degree of reliability compared to others. Therefore, there are no grammatical errors in this sentence, so I am returning 1 for a correct sentence.
0	The sentence contains a grammatical error known as a double negative. The phrase "any trouble" already implies negation, so adding another negative ("don't") results in incorrect usage. A corrected version of the sentence would be: "I don't want any trouble."
1	The sentence "They may grow as high as bamboo" is grammatically correct. The subject "they" refers to some unspecified entities that have the ability or potential to grow very tall. The phrase "as high as" functions as a preposition here, indicating the height of these entities will be comparable to something else (in this case, bamboo). Bamboo itself can grow quite tall, so using it as a point of comparison makes sense in context. There are no obvious grammatical errors or awkward phrasings, making this a valid English sentence.
0	The sentence contains several grammatical and punctuation errors that make it difficult to understand. Here's a corrected version: "Some of them made as many as twenty errors." * "as" should be replaced with "as many as" for clarity and accuracy. * There should be a numeral instead of spelling out "twenty" since it refers to a specific number. * A comma is needed after "made" to separate the introductory phrase from the main clause.
0	The pronoun used in this sentence is incorrect. The reflexive pronoun for the subject "Sally" should be "herself," not "himself." Therefore, the grammatically correct version of this sentence would be "Sally kissed herself."
1	The sentence "Drew believes I think Rosie loves magazine ads." is grammatically correct. Here's a breakdown of why: * "Drew" is the subject of the first clause, and it is in the third person singular form (believes), which agrees with the plural noun "Rosie" later on in the sentence. * Each verb ("believes," "think," and "loves") is conjugated correctly based on its corresponding subject. * There is no misplaced modifier or ambiguous pronoun reference. * All words used in the sentence have clear meanings that make sense in context. Therefore, there are no missing or unnecessary words. Overall, the structure and syntax of the sentence follow standard English rules, so it can be considered grammatically correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It contains a list of five names followed by a verb ("left") that agrees in number with the subject (five people). There are no punctuation or spelling errors, and the word order is appropriate for standard English.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It uses the subjunctive mood ("we'll make it") to express a hope or desire about the future, which is followed by the preposition "without" and the noun phrase "snow." This structure correctly conveys that the speaker hopes for no snow during the winter.
0	The subject of the second clause ("Betsy is pretty") is "Betsy," which is a proper noun referring to a female person. However, the pronoun used in the first clause ("that shows herself") suggests that the subject is feminine as well, implying that "blue leather" refers to some kind of sentient being that can display itself, which is incorrect usage. A more appropriate way to phrase the sentence would be "The blue leather reveals how pretty Betsy is."
1	The sentence "Gwen hit the baseball" is grammatically correct. It contains a subject (Gwen), a verb (hit), and an object (the baseball). There are no spelling or punctuation errors, and the word order follows standard English syntax rules.
0	The sentence contains a spelling mistake. The word "hit" should be "have." A correct version of the sentence would be: "I have that you knew the answer." However, even after fixing the spelling error, the revised sentence remains ungrammatical and does not make sense in standard English. It appears to mix up several different grammatical structures without any clear meaning or purpose.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It uses the correlative conjunction "or" to connect two independent clauses, each containing a first-person singular present perfect tense verb ("I've lost") followed by its direct object ("my wallet" and "my mind").
1	The sentence "It was a brand new car that he bought" is grammatically correct. Here's why: - The subject of the sentence is "it," which refers to something previously mentioned or understood from context. - The verb phrase "was a brand new car" contains a linking verb ("was") followed by a predicate noun ("a brand new car"). This structure is used to describe the subject. - The relative clause "that he bought" modifies the predicate noun "car." It uses the relative pronoun "that" to introduce the clause and shows the relationship between the action (buying) and the participant (he). Overall, the sentence has clear syntax and proper use of grammatical structures, making it a valid English sentence.
1	The sentence "He likes cookies and he hates crumb cake." is grammatically correct. The subject-verb agreement is consistent throughout the sentence (he likes, he hates), and each clause contains a clear subject ("he") followed by a verb ("likes" or "hates"). Additionally, the objects of the verbs ("cookies" and "crumb cake") are both correctly used as plural nouns following singular subjects. There are no punctuation errors, misspelled words, or incorrect word usage in the sentence. Therefore, it can be concluded that the sentence is grammatically correct, and I would assign it a score of 1.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The verb "chased" is in the past tense and agrees with its subject "they." The preposition "with" indicates that the man possesses or is associated with the car. Therefore, there are no errors to correct.
1	The sentence "I didn't have a red cent" is grammatically correct. This phrase is an idiomatic expression that means someone did not have any money at all.
0	The sentence contains two independent clauses that need to be connected by a conjunction or punctuated correctly as separate sentences. Additionally, there is no determiner before "Blackwell." A corrected version could be: "The book of poems takes a very long time to read, and it comes from Blackwell." Or alternatively: "The book of poems and the one from Blackwell both take a very long time to read."
1	The sentence "the one with a red cover takes a very long time to read" is grammatically correct. There are no spelling errors or punctuation issues. Additionally, the syntax of the sentence follows standard English structure, making it easy to understand.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject "John" is followed by the verb "has," which agrees with the singular subject. The prepositional phrase "of dogs" clearly explains what John fears. All elements contribute to a clear, complete thought that follows standard English syntax rules.
0	In this sentence, we have a subject-verb agreement error. The subject of the sentence is "the building," which is singular. Therefore, the verb must also be singular. However, the verb used here is "is" which is a singular form of to be but it agrees with plural noun 'roof'. So, a corrected version would be either "The building's roof is leaking" or "The building leaks."
0	The adjective "dark" is redundant because "black" already implies darkness. Also, there should be a possessive apostrophe after "panther," but before the final "s." A correct version would be: "The panther's coat is black."
1	The sentence "Colin asked if they could get a mortgage" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "Colin" is the subject of the sentence, which is a proper noun and correctly spelled. * "asked" is the past tense of the verb "ask," indicating that Colin performed the action of asking something. * "if" introduces a dependent clause expressing a condition or uncertainty. * "they" refers to a group of people who can potentially perform the action described by the main clause. It agrees with the plural subject implied by "could." * "could" is the modal auxiliary verb used here to indicate possibility or permission. It also agrees with the plural subject "they." * "get" is the infinitive form of the verb following the modal auxiliary verb "could." * "a mortgage" is a singular countable noun phrase referring to a type of loan commonly taken out for purchasing real estate. Overall, all elements of the sentence are properly constructed and agree with one another, making it grammatically correct.
0	This sentence contains a misplaced modifier error. The phrase "the man I saw" suggests that the action of robbing the bank was performed by the same person who got into the cab, but the original sentence structure implies that the man only witnessed the robbery. To fix this issue, we could rephrase it as "The man who I saw get into the cab later robbed the bank." or "I saw the man get into the cab who robbed the bank."
1	The sentence "I know you eat asparagus." is grammatically correct. It consists of a subject ("I"), a verb ("know"), and an object clause ("you eat asparagus"). There are no spelling or punctuation errors, and all words are used correctly. Therefore, it receives a score of 1 for being grammatically correct.
1	The sentence "John's drum will always bother me" is grammatically correct. Here, "John's drum" is a genitive noun phrase that indicates possession. It tells us that the drum belongs to John. "Will always" expresses future tense and certainty about the action taking place. Finally, "bother" is a verb that means to annoy or disturb someone, which takes the first-person singular pronoun "me" as its object. Therefore, there are no grammatical errors in this sentence.
1	The sentence "An evil thought struck Dave" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "Evil" is a adjective describing the noun "thought." * "Struck" is the past tense of the verb "strike," which means to hit or affect someone suddenly. In this context, it implies that Dave was suddenly affected by an evil thought. * "Dave" is a proper noun serving as the direct object of the sentence, receiving the action of being struck by the evil thought. Overall, the sentence has a clear subject ("an evil thought"), a verb ("struck"), and an object ("Dave"), making it a complete and grammatically correct sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence, "John," is performing the action described by the verb, "put." Additionally, we have a direct object, "the book," which is receiving the action of the verb. Finally, there is a prepositional phrase, "on the table," that tells us where the action took place. All of these elements combine to form a complete and proper English sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence, "Phillip," is the person performing the action (gave), which is indicated by the past tense verb "gave." The indirect object of the sentence, "the soldier," receives the direct object of the sentence, "the medal." Both the use of articles ("the") and word order follow standard English conventions.
0	The verb "thinks" requires a subject and an object in the form of a clause starting with a verb in base form (also known as the infinitive). In this case, "Andy to eat salmon flavored candy bars" does not follow the pattern for a proper clause because it uses the incorrect infinitive form "to eat." It should be "Andy to eat salmon-flavored candy bars" or "that Andy eats salmon-flavored candy bars."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence, "Heidi," is followed by a verb in the third person singular form ("thinks"). The subordinate clause "that Andy should eat salmon flavored candy bars" contains a proper subject-verb agreement as well. Additionally, all words are spelled correctly, and there are no punctuation errors or awkward phrasings to detract from the clarity of meaning.
1	The sentence "He danced" is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple sentence with a subject ("he") and a verb ("danced"). Both the subject and verb agree in number (singular), making the sentence grammatically sound.
0	The verb "did" needs to agree with its subject in number. In this case, the subject "Calvin" is singular, so the verb should be "did" **not** "does." Additionally, a pronoun such as "he" or "his" isn't necessary after the subject when forming a question; it would actually make the sentence ungrammatical. So, a grammatically correct version of the sentence would be simply "Did Calvin do his homework?"
1	The sentence "Sylvia was slapping Jeff upside the head in martial arts class" is grammatically correct. It contains a complete thought and all of its elements are arranged properly to convey meaning. Here's a breakdown of the sentence structure: * Subject: Sylvia (a noun phrase) * Verb: was slapping (a verb phrase) * Direct object: Jeff (a noun phrase) * Preposition: upside (a preposition) * Object of the preposition: the head (a noun phrase) * Location: in martial arts class (a prepositional phrase) All of these components work together to create a coherent sentence that accurately conveys the intended message.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The conditional structure "if + past simple, would + infinitive" is used to express hypothetical or unlikely conditions in the present or future. In this case, "If I am a rich man" implies that the speaker is currently not rich but imagines what they would do if they were wealthy, making it a hypothetical condition.
1	The sentence "If he were a rich man, he'd buy a diamond ring" is grammatically correct. It uses the subjunctive mood to express hypothetical or unlikely situations. In this case, "were" is used instead of "was," which is standard for expressing unreal conditions in English.
1	The sentence "John is likely to leave" is grammatically correct. Here's a breakdown of why: - "John" is a proper noun that refers to a person, so it functions as the subject of the sentence. - "is likely" serves as the auxiliary verb (also known as a helping verb), which helps express tense and voice. In this case, it indicates likelihood or probability. - "to leave" is an infinitive phrase acting as the predicate of the sentence, describing what action John is likely to take. Overall, the structure of the sentence follows standard English grammar rules, making it a valid English statement.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It consists of a subject ("The manager") and a verb ("laughed"). The subject refers to a singular noun, so the past tense verb "laughed" agrees with it in number.
0	This sentence is missing a subject, which makes it grammatically incorrect. A complete sentence requires both a subject and a predicate (verb). For example, to make this into a complete sentence, we could say "The ship was sunk."
0	The sentence contains a common grammatical error known as a tense shift. The verb "did" indicates that the speaker is asking about a past event, but the verb phrase "you think" should be changed to its past tense form "thought." A corrected version of the sentence would read, "Who did you **think** kissed the gorilla?" This helps maintain consistency in the tense used throughout the sentence.
1	The sentence "Have you seen my model airplane collection?" is grammatically correct. It consists of a question tagged with a helping verb ("have") to form a yes-no question. Additionally, it has a subject ("you"), a main verb ("seen"), and an object ("my model airplane collection"). All elements follow standard rules for word order (SVO) and punctuation.
1	The sentence "It seems that Lucy was mugged" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "it," which refers to a situation or state of affairs. The verb phrase "was mugged" is in the passive voice and agrees with its singular subject "Lucy." The word "that" introduces a subordinate clause modifying the subject "it." Overall, the sentence has proper syntax, grammatical agreement, and clear meaning.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The past tense of the verb "eat" agrees with the subject "I." Additionally, the relative clause "that was filled with lima beans" modifies the noun "salad" appropriately. There are no obvious spelling or punctuation errors in the sentence.
1	The sentence "There were four men arriving at the station when I pulled up" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * The subject of the sentence is "there," which is a dummy pronoun used to introduce the existence or appearance of something. It agrees with the verb "were." * "Four men" is the actual subject of the sentence, and it agrees with the plural form of the auxiliary verb "to be," i.e., "were." * The present participle phrase "arriving at the station" modifies the noun "men," indicating that they were on their way to the station. This construction is called the progressive aspect, which shows ongoing action. * The conjunction "when" introduces a subordinate clause that describes the time of the main clause. * Finally, "I pulled up" is another independent clause describing the speaker's actions. Overall, the sentence has proper agreement between subjects and verbs, uses appropriate tenses, and contains no grammatical errors.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Jean," which is a noun in the third person singular form. The verb that follows it ("is") agrees with the subject because it is the appropriate third person singular form of the verb "to be." Additionally, the infinitive phrase "to dance" correctly functions as the direct object of the sentence, following the transitive verb "reluctant."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "I", which is implied and understood rather than explicitly stated. The verb is "want", which agrees with its subject in number (both singular). "Her" is a possessive pronoun that refers back to a female person who has previously been mentioned or is known from context. Finally, "to dance" is an infinitive phrase acting as the direct object of the sentence, receiving the action of the verb "want".
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence, "Jean," is the person doing the action (persuading), and the object of the sentence, "Robert," is the person receiving the action. The verb "persuaded" agrees with the singular subject "Jean." There are no grammatical errors or misspellings in this sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Jean," who is expressed as wanting something. The infinitive phrase "to do the Macarena" functions as the direct object of the sentence, indicating what Jean wants Bill to do. The structure is clear and concise, making it a proper English sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "the children," which is a plural noun. The verb that agrees with a plural subject should also be in its plural form, so "admire" (third-person present tense) is used correctly here. Additionally, there is no misplaced modifier or missing punctuation marks, making the entire structure clear and concise for readers to understand.
1	The sentence "Who has Peter talked with?" is grammatically correct. It is a question asking about the person or people that Peter has spoken to. The word order follows standard English syntax rules for forming questions by inverting the subject ("Peter") and auxiliary verb ("has").
1	The sentence "Heidi likes her violin" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "Heidi" is a proper noun that refers to a specific person. It starts with a capital letter and has no articles (a, an, or the) before it. * "likes" is a verb in the present tense that indicates a preference or enjoyment of something. In this case, it shows that Heidi enjoys playing the violin. * "her" is a possessive determiner that agrees with the gender of the subject ("Heidi") and modifies the following noun ("violin"). * "violin" is a common noun that names a musical instrument played with a bow. Overall, the sentence follows standard English grammar rules for word order, agreement between subjects and verbs, and use of determiners and prepositions.
0	The pronoun "himself" does not agree with its antecedent "Mary." In order for a reflexive pronoun to be grammatically correct, it must refer back to the subject of the sentence or clause and match the gender and number of that noun. Here, since "Mary" is female, the correct form would be "herself," so the corrected sentence should read: "John thinks that Mary loves herself."
0	The sentence contains a small error related to pronoun agreement. It's more appropriate to say "Which pictures of him does John like?" instead because the verb 'does' agrees with the third-person singular pronoun 'he' or 'him'. Using 'himself' here would imply that John likes selfies or photos of himself taken by someone else.
0	The indefinite article "an" should be used instead of "any" before a vowel sound. In this case, "owl" starts with a consonant letter but has a vowel sound (/aʊ/). Therefore, the corrected sentence is "An owl hunts mice."
0	This sentence contains a double negative ("didn't" and "no indefinite article"), which creates confusion and makes it unclear whether or not the subject ate dinner. The corrected sentence could be "No man ate dinner" or "Any man didn't have to eat dinner," depending on the intended meaning.
1	The sentence "A pilot could be flying this plane" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "a pilot," which is singular, so the verb must also be singular. In this case, "could be flying" is the third-person singular form of the verb "to fly," which agrees with the subject "pilot." Additionally, all of the words are spelled correctly, there are no missing or extra punctuation marks, and the word order follows standard English conventions. Therefore, I would rate this sentence as grammatically correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It contains a relative clause ("whoever they were") that modifies the noun phrase "everybody who attended last week's huge rally." This clause provides additional information about the people being referred to. The use of the singular "they" (referring back to "whoever") is also grammatically acceptable here, as it allows for gender-neutral language when referring to someone whose gender is unknown or irrelevant. Overall, the sentence is clear, concise, and well-constructed.
1	The sentence "Anybody who attended last week's huge rally signed the petition" is grammatically correct. Here are some reasons why it's correct: * The subject of the sentence is "anybody," which is a singular pronoun that refers to an unspecified person. This is followed by the relative clause "who attended last week's huge rally." Relative clauses modify nouns or pronouns and provide additional information about them. In this case, the relative clause modifies "anybody" and tells us more about the person being referred to. * The verb tense used in the sentence is past tense, as indicated by "attended" and "signed." Since both actions happened in the past, using past tense for both verbs is appropriate. * The word order follows standard English syntax rules. The subject comes before the verb, and the object (the petition) comes after the verb. Additionally, there are no missing words or unnecessary repetitions. Overall, the sentence is well-constructed and does not contain any grammatical errors.
0	The subject of the sentence is "Any tiger," which is a singular noun. However, the verb "has" that follows it is plural. This mismatch between the number of the subject and the verb makes the sentence grammatically incorrect. A corrected version would be "Any tiger has orange fur and is marked with black stripes." Alternatively, to keep the original structure, we could say "All tigers have orange fur, marked with black stripes."
0	Albinism in animals refers to a genetic condition that causes a lack of pigmentation in the skin, hair, or eyes. In the case of tigers, albinism would result in a white coat rather than an orange one. Therefore, it's incorrect to say that any albino tiger has orange fur; they would have white fur instead. The rest of the sentence is grammatically correct but semantically flawed due to the misinformation about albino tigers.
0	The sentence contains a vague pronoun reference. It's unclear what the subject of the second clause ("you") refers to - it could be anyone, since the first clause doesn't specify who is supposed to pick the flower. A corrected version might read: "Pick any flower that you see." This way, the subject of both clauses (the implied "you") is clear.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. Here's a breakdown of the structure: * "Any" functions as a determiner, referring to an unspecified pilot currently on duty. * "pilot" is the subject noun that the sentence revolves around. * "on duty today" describes when the set of possible pilots is limited to those working during the current day. * "could be" represents modal auxiliary verbs indicating possibility or ability in the past, present, or future. In this case, it refers to potential actions in the present. * "flying" serves as the verb phrase for what any of these pilots might do while on duty. * "this plane" points to a specific aircraft being referred to by the speaker or writer. In summary, the sentence conveys the idea that among all available pilots scheduled for work today, any one of them has the capability or authorization to operate the mentioned airplane.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It contains a complete thought (also known as an independent clause), which can stand alone as a sentence: "You may pick every flower." There is also a dependent clause that adds additional information to the main clause: "but leave a few for Mary." Together they form a complex sentence. Each part of the sentence follows standard subject-verb agreement rules, and all words are spelled correctly. Additionally, punctuation marks are used appropriately throughout the sentence. Therefore, I would rate it as grammatically correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It contains two independent clauses ("The Dodgers beat the Red Sox" and "were beaten by the Giants") that are connected by a coordinating conjunction ("and"). Each clause has a subject ("The Dodgers," "they" or "was beaten" implies "the Dodgers" as the subject) and a verb ("beat," "were beaten"), so they can stand alone as separate sentences if needed. Additionally, each clause expresses a complete thought about the Dodgers playing against different teams (Red Sox and Giants), making it easy to understand what happened without needing additional context.
1	The sentence "In which car was the man seen?" is grammatically correct. It contains a preposition ("in"), a possessive adjective ("which") that refers to "car," a verb form of the linking verb "was" (third person singular), the subject noun phrase "the man," and the past participle "seen." Each word is used correctly and contributes to a coherent meaning.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "The man" is a noun phrase that serves as the subject of the sentence. It is singular and agrees with the verb tense used later in the sentence. * "who Mary loves and Sally hates" is a relative clause modifying "the man." Both clauses ("loves" and "hates") share the same subject (implied to be "Mary"). Although it might seem unusual for two contrasting emotions to be connected by "and," there is no grammatical error here since they both describe different people's feelings towards the same person. * "computed" is the past tense form of the verb "compute," which means to calculate or determine something mathematically. In this case, it indicates that the action took place in the past. Therefore, I would rate this sentence as grammatically correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The clause "which Mary made" provides additional information about the noun it modifies, "the kennel." It can be removed without changing the meaning of the rest of the sentence, so we know that it's a nonessential relative clause (also called an unrestrictive relative clause). A comma would typically set off such a clause from the rest of the sentence, but commas are often omitted in informal writing when they aren't needed for clarity. In this case, no commas are necessary because there's only one relative clause, and its position in the sentence makes clear where it belongs.
1	The sentence "Tom said he would and Bill actually did eat a raw eggplant" is grammatically correct. It contains two independent clauses ("Tom said he would..." and "Bill actually did eat a raw eggplant") connected by a conjunction ("and"). Each clause has a subject ("Tom", "Bill") and a verb ("said", "did eat"), so they can stand alone as separate sentences if needed. Additionally, there are no spelling or punctuation errors in the sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("the wealthy young man"), a verb ("bought"), and an object ("that piano"). Additionally, it includes a prepositional phrase ("for his secret fiancée") which provides more information about the action of buying. All of these elements work together to form a coherent and complete sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It consists of a noun phrase ("the dog") followed by a verb phrase ("stole the turkey"). Both phrases contain all necessary components (determiner, adjective, noun for the noun phrase; auxiliary verb, main verb, determiner, noun for the verb phrase) and form a complete thought, making it a well-formed simple sentence in English.
1	The sentence "a tall building" is grammatically correct. It consists of a determiner ("a"), an adjective ("tall"), and a noun ("building"). The subject-verb agreement is also correct as there is no verb present in the sentence. Therefore, it returns 1 for being grammatically correct.
1	The sentence "This building is tall" is grammatically correct. Here, we have a subject ("this building") followed by a linking verb ("is"), which is used to connect the subject to its complement. In this case, the complement is the adjective phrase "tall," which describes the quality of the building being referred to. Therefore, there are no errors in grammar or syntax in this sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "I" and the verb is "like." The object of the verb is "the book," which follows both the definite article "the" and a possessive pronoun ("which") that refers back to "you." There are no missing words or punctuation errors, so the sentence can be understood clearly by any native speaker.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("Captain Wentworth"), a verb ("wrote"), and an object ("a letter to Anne Elliott"). The structure of the sentence is clear and easy to understand. There are no spelling errors or misplaced words. Therefore, I would rate this sentence as grammatically correct and assign it a score of 1.
0	In English, we use a auxiliary verb (also called a helping verb) before the subject when asking questions, except for subjects that begin with who or what. Since the subject here is "Alison," and it does not start with who or what, the correct form of the question would be "She asked **is** Alison coming to the party."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The past perfect tense ("had been") is used appropriately to indicate that the action of being offended occurred before another past action (implied but not stated). Additionally, the word order, punctuation, and spelling are all correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Fanny," which is the person doing the action. The verb of the sentence is "regretted," which describes a past feeling or emotion from Fanny. The preposition "having" introduces a gerund clause, "to talk to Aunt Norris." Gerund clauses function as nouns in a sentence; here it serves as the direct object of the verb "regretted." Overall, each word has been used correctly according to its part of speech, there are no missing words, and the structure follows standard English grammar rules.
1	The sentence "Knowing the country well, he took a short cut" is grammatically correct. There is no punctuation or grammar error in this sentence. It contains an independent clause "he took a shortcut," which expresses a complete thought, and it is modified by the introductory phrase "knowing the country well." This type of construction is common in English writing to provide additional context about the subject before stating the main action they take. Therefore, there is no need for a comma after "short cut" because it does not introduce another independent clause.
1	The sentence "He left the train with somebody else's wallet in his pocket." is grammatically correct. Here, we have a simple sentence with one independent clause ("he left the train") and one dependent clause ("with somebody else's wallet in his pocket"). Both clauses contain proper subject-verb agreement, use appropriate verb tenses, and follow standard syntax rules for word order. There are no spelling errors or missing punctuation marks. Therefore, I would rate this sentence as grammatically correct and assign it a score of 1.
1	The sentence "Magnus went to Ireland" is grammatically correct. It consists of a proper noun (Magnus), a past tense verb (went), and a place name (Ireland). There are no spelling errors or misplaced words, so I would rate it as 1 for being grammatically correct.
0	The sentence is missing a preposition such as 'to' after 'send'. A correct version would be "Who did John send the book to?" or "To whom did John send the book?"
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It contains a simple subject ("the idea") and a predicate ("dismayed the Prime Minister that the Dome was dull"). Additionally, it uses proper punctuation to separate clauses. Therefore, there are no errors to correct.
0	This sentence is grammatically incorrect because it uses a double negative ("did not" and "without") which creates confusion about the intended meaning of the sentence. A corrected version could be: "He came right in without even knocking."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence, "Harriet," is a proper noun and the object, "Mr. Knightley," is also a proper noun. Both are correctly spelled and capitalized. Additionally, the verb "admired" agrees with the singular subject "Harriet." There are no punctuation or grammar errors, making this a well-constructed English sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It consists of a subject ("the book") and a predicate ("is boring"). The verb "is" agrees with its singular subject "book," and the adjective "boring" correctly describes the book.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no spelling errors or punctuation issues. Additionally, the word order follows standard English syntax rules, making it a well-structured question.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Emma," who is performing the action of making food for someone named "Harriet." Both names are proper nouns and capitalized correctly. The verb "made" agrees with the singular subject "Emma," and "some food" is a valid object phrase indicating what was made. Overall, there are no errors or awkward constructions that would require correction.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple sentence structure: subject ("the window") + verb ("was broken") + preposition ("with") + object ("a hammer"). There are no spelling or punctuation errors present in this sentence as well. Therefore, it can be concluded that the sentence "The window was broken with a hammer" is grammatically correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The verb "lay" is used correctly here because it requires a direct object ("motionless"), indicating that something or someone is being placed down (in this case, the fugitive is deliberately remaining still). Additionally, the phrase "in order to avoid discovery" provides logical reasoning for why the fugitive is lying motionless. Overall, the sentence has proper syntax, word choice, and punctuation, making it a valid English sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "the guard," which is singular. The verb that agrees with a singular subject is "marched." The object of the verb is "the prisoners," and it is followed by the preposition "round" and the noun "yard." All parts of speech are used correctly, so this sentence is grammatically correct.
1	The sentence "Frank Churchill crossed the street" is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("Frank Churchill"), a verb ("crossed") and a direct object ("the street"). Additionally, there are no spelling or punctuation errors. Therefore, it can be considered as a valid English sentence.
1	The sentence "Emma and Harriet were attacked yesterday" is grammatically correct. It consists of a complete thought, or independent clause, that contains two simple subjects (Emma and Harriet) joined by a coordinating conjunction (and), as well as a verb tense that clearly indicates when the action took place (yesterday). There are no spelling errors, punctuation errors, or other grammatical issues present in this sentence.
1	The sentence "Fiona might be here by 5 o'clock" is grammatically correct. Here, "might" is used as an auxiliary verb to express possibility or uncertainty about Fiona arriving. Additionally, "be" is correctly conjugated for the third person singular subject ("Fiona") and present tense. Finally, the prepositional phrase "by 5 o'clock" provides a clear time reference for when Fiona may arrive. Overall, there are no grammatical errors in this sentence.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It contains two independent clauses joined by the conjunction "and". Each clause has its own subject ("I" and "of the opinion") and verb phrase ("am expecting" and "is a desirable one"). Additionally, the use of the preposition "of" followed by the gerund form "expecting" is also grammatically correct, indicating that the speaker holds a positive view towards getting the job.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It consists of two independent clauses ("Pat was awarded the Golden Fleece Award" and "he was very upset about it") that are connected by a comma and the conjunction "and." This structure is called a compound sentence, which is a type of complex sentence. In addition to being grammatically correct, the sentence also makes sense logically. Therefore, I would rate it as 1 (correct).
0	The sentence contains two grammatical errors. Firstly, "kim" should be capitalized as it is a proper noun. Secondly, "beating" should be replaced with "beats" or "beat", depending on whether the action is happening now (beats) or has already happened (beat). Additionally, there should be a conjunction such as "and" to connect the two actions. A corrected version of the sentence could read: "Kim alienates cats and beats his dog." However, even with these corrections made, the content of the sentence raises ethical concerns due to the depiction of animal cruelty.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject "they" agrees with the verb "knew." The clause "that pictures of each other would be on sale" correctly follows the conjugated verb as a subordinate clause. There are no grammatical errors or awkward phrasings in this sentence.
0	The sentence contains a pronoun "he" which doesn't have a clear antecedent. It's unclear who "Terry" is or what specific articles were involved. A corrected version of the sentence could be: "Which article did Terry fail to read before filing?"
1	The sentence "I want to try and buy some whiskey" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * The subject of the sentence is "I," which is a proper first-person singular pronoun. * The verb "want" agrees with the subject "I." * The infinitive phrase "to try and buy some whiskey" functions as the direct object of the sentence. This infinitive phrase contains two verbs ("try" and "buy") connected by the conjunction "and." Both verbs have their own objects, namely "some whiskey." * All words are spelled correctly. * Punctuation is used appropriately.
0	The sentence contains a grammatical error. It should be "She goes to buy some whiskey" instead of "she goes and buying some whiskey." In this corrected version, "to" indicates the purpose or intention of going, which makes the sentence grammatically correct.
0	The verb "is" must agree in number with its subject. Here, the subject of the sentence is "Kim and Terry," which is plural. Therefore, the correct form of the verb to use would be "are." So a corrected version of the sentence would read: "Kim and Terry are happy."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence, "Kim," is doing the action of giving money to two different people, "Bobbie" and "Jean." The objects of the sentence are "a dollar" and "a dime," which indicate the specific amounts that were given. Each object has a clear recipient, making the meaning of the sentence clear. There are no grammatical errors or awkward phrasings, so I would rate this sentence as correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no spelling errors or awkward phrasings that would detract from its clarity. Additionally, the use of tenses indicates that the action (putting up the picture) will take place before tomorrow.
1	The sentence appears to be grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("the girl in the red coat"), a verb ("will put"), and an object ("a picture of Bill"). Additionally, it utilizes appropriate tense (future), proper punctuation, and clear syntax.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no spelling errors or punctuation marks that need to be corrected. Additionally, the syntax and word choice follow standard English conventions. Therefore, I would rate this sentence as being correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject "Ann" is clearly identified, the verb "bought" agrees with the singular subject, and the direct object "a first edition of Richard III" provides more detail about what was purchased. The prepositional phrase "for $1000" modifies the verb by telling us how much she paid. All in all, the sentence is clear, concise, and properly constructed according to standard English rules.
1	The sentence "John became deadly afraid of flying" is grammatically correct. The word "deadly" is used here as an adverb to modify the adjective "afraid," which is a common usage in English to mean "extremely." Therefore, there is no error in this sentence.
1	The sentence "What John promised is to be gentle" is grammatically correct. However, it might sound a bit awkward because we usually use infinitive verb forms (to + base form of the verb) as subjects only in more formal or literary contexts. In everyday speech and writing, it would be more common to say something like "John's promise was to be gentle." Nonetheless, the original sentence is still grammatical, so I will mark it as correct.
0	The sentence contains a minor error known as a question fragment. A complete sentence requires both a subject and a predicate (verb). In this case, "Henri wants to buy" is the main clause that forms the predicate of the sentence, but there is no clear subject or verb for the relative clause "which books about cooking". To fix this, we could ask a specific question such as "Which books about cooking does Henri want to buy?" This formulation includes subjects ("books", "Henri") and verbs ("does want", "cooking") for each clause within the sentence.
1	The sentence "I will fix the computer for Carol" is grammatically correct. Here's a breakdown of why it works: * "I": This is a first-person singular pronoun used as the subject of the sentence. It agrees with the verb "will fix." * "will fix": This is the future tense of the verb "to fix," indicating that the action has not yet occurred but is expected to happen. In this case, "fix" means to repair or mend something. * "the": This is a definite article referring to a specific computer that has already been mentioned or is known to both the speaker and listener. * "computer": This is a noun referring to a programmable electronic device designed to accept data, perform prescribed mathematical and logical operations at high speed, and produce a result in the form of processed data, either alone or in conjunction with peripheral equipment. * "for": This preposition indicates purpose or benefit, meaning that the action of fixing the computer is done on behalf of someone else (Carol). * "Carol": This is a proper noun referring to a female person. In this context, it functions as the indirect object of the sentence, receiving the benefit of the fixed computer.
1	The sentence "Smith loaned a valuable collection of manuscripts to the library" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * The subject "Smith" is the person who performed the action. It is in the third-person singular form and agrees with the past tense verb "loaned." * The verb "loaned" indicates that Smith transferred ownership or possession of something (the collection) to someone else (the library). * The direct object "a valuable collection of manuscripts" receives the action of the verb "loaned." This phrase includes an article ("a") followed by a descriptive adjective ("valuable"), which modifies the noun "collection," which in turn is modified by another prepositional phrase ("of manuscripts"). All these elements follow standard rules for word order and agreement. * Finally, the indirect object "to the library" specifies the recipient of the action. The preposition "to" introduces the prepositional phrase, which contains the definite article "the" and the plural noun "library." Again, all these elements conform to grammatical conventions.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It contains a simple subject ("the paper") and a verb in the past tense ("is cut"). The doer of the action (Mary) is indicated using the preposition "by." There is no ambiguity or confusion for the reader.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. Both "was from six to nine" and "it took place from six to nine" are valid ways of expressing that something happened between six o'clock and nine o'clock. The first option uses a verb phrase ("was") along with a prepositional phrase ("from six to nine"), while the second option uses the passive voice of the verb "take" together with another prepositional phrase. Both forms follow standard English grammar rules and convey the intended meaning clearly.
1	The sentence "Suddenly, there arrived two inspectors from the INS" is grammatically correct. However, it might sound more natural to say or write "Suddenly, two inspectors from the INS arrived." In general, subject-auxiliary inversion (e.g., "there arrived") can be used for emphasis or literary effect, but it's less common in everyday speech and writing. Nonetheless, the original sentence is still grammatical and meaningful, so I will assign a score of 1.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It consists of two independent clauses ("The soup cooks" and "thickens") that are connected by a comma to form a compound predicate. Both clauses describe the same subject (the soup), so it's appropriate to use a compound predicate here. Additionally, the verb tense is consistent throughout the sentence, making it even more grammatically sound.
1	The sentence "I gave money to the charity" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * The subject of the sentence, "I," is a pronoun that refers to the speaker or writer. It agrees with the verb "gave." * The verb "gave" is a past tense form of the verb "give." It indicates that the action occurred in the past. * The direct object of the sentence, "money," is the noun phrase that receives the action of the verb. It follows the pattern of "give + direct object." * The preposition "to" introduces the indirect object of the sentence, "the charity." This noun phrase identifies who received the benefit of the action. Overall, the sentence has a clear structure and uses standard grammatical forms.
1	The sentence "John asked." is grammatically correct. It consists of a proper noun (John) followed by a verb in past tense (asked). There is no subject-verb agreement issue or any other grammatical errors in this sentence. Therefore, it can be considered as a valid English sentence.
0	The sentence "I saw even the student" is grammatically incorrect because of the misuse of the word "even." In this context, "even" implies a surprising or unexpected situation, which requires a comparative element to make sense. For example, it would be appropriate to say "I saw even the quietest student," indicating that the speaker was surprised by the behavior of the usually reserved individual. Therefore, without any additional information for comparison, using "even" is unnecessary and confusing. A correct version could simply be "I saw the student."
0	This sentence is grammatically incorrect because it lacks a main verb that connects to both of the subjects ("John" and "Mary"). A corrected version could be "John whispered that Mary had left." or "John saw Mary leave," depending on what the intended meaning is.
0	In English, we typically use if-clauses to express a question about the future, rather than wondering clauses. A more appropriate way to phrase the sentence would be "Mary wonders if Bill will come." This construction indicates that Mary is uncertain about whether or not Bill will arrive.
0	The verb "will" indicates future tense, but it needs to be followed by a base form of the verb (e.g., "Sophie will go to the theater."). In this case, "theater" is being used as a noun, so we need to add a preposition such as 'to' before it. Additionally, if we want to use "theater" as a verb meaning "to perform or present on stage," we would still need to change the word order ("Sophie will theatre in").
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of both clauses is "John", who performs two actions - finishing the cake and drinking the lemonade. Both verbs ("finished" and "drank") agree with their corresponding subjects in tense (past) and number (singular). Additionally, there is a conjunction ("and") connecting the two independent clauses, making it clear that they are related but separate thoughts. Overall, the structure and usage of grammar elements in this sentence make it a well-formed and coherent statement.
0	This sentence is grammatically incorrect because of the reflexive pronoun "herself." In this context, it would need to be replaced by a regular personal pronoun such as "she" since there is no emphasis on the subject doing the action (liking) to themselves. A corrected version could read: "She likes Mary's mother."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "each of the boys," which is plural. The verb that agrees with a plural subject is "fought." The prepositional phrase "with some of the other boys" functions as the object of the verb. It indicates that each boy fought with some (but not all) of the other boys. Therefore, there is no error in this sentence.
0	The pronoun used to refer back to "John's mother" should be "she," not "himself." Therefore, the grammatically correct version of this sentence would be "John's mother likes herself."
0	The pronoun used to refer to a single male person should be "himself," but it must agree in number with its antecedent "Mary." However, since "Mary" is grammatically singular and feminine, using "herself" would have been appropriate. Thus, the corrected version of the sentence should read as follows: "Mary revealed herself to John."
1	The sentence "Mary believes that Bill saw himself" is grammatically correct. There are no spelling errors, punctuation errors, or grammatical errors in the sentence. Additionally, the meaning of the sentence is clear and unambiguous. Therefore, I would classify this sentence as being grammatically correct and assign it a score of 1.
1	The sentence "John heard that they criticized themselves" is grammatically correct. It consists of a noun phrase ("John"), a verb phrase ("heard") indicating past tense, a conjunction ("that"), another verb phrase ("they criticized") indicating past tense, and a reflexive pronoun ("themselves"). All elements are used appropriately, making the sentence grammatical.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence, "Mary," is followed by a verb, "thinks." The verb agrees with the singular subject. Following the verb is a clause, "that she is smart," which contains another subject, "she," and predicate, "is smart." Both subjects agree with their verbs in number (singular), tense (present), and person (third). All parts of speech follow standard rules for usage and form, so no changes to spelling or punctuation are needed.
1	The sentence "Henry found that Bill is sad" is grammatically correct. In this sentence, "found" is used as a verb indicating discovery or realization, while "that Bill is sad" is a noun clause acting as the direct object of the sentence. It's clear who (Henry) did what (discovered), and why it happened (Bill being sad). All elements of the sentence function appropriately according to their intended meanings, making it a valid construction in standard English.
0	The phrase "proud of" suggests that John has a positive feeling about something or someone (in this case, Mary). However, when using "considers", it implies that the subject (John) holds a certain opinion or judgment regarding the object (Mary), rather than expressing a direct emotion towards her. A more appropriate way to convey John's pride would be: "John feels proud of Mary." Alternatively, if John regards Mary as being arrogant or haughty, one could say, "John considers Mary proud," although that doesn't seem to fit the intended meaning based on the provided context.
0	The correct form of this sentence should be "You should sit there before." In this corrected version, "there" comes after "sit," because it's the destination or location where the action takes place. Also, we use "before" to indicate that something happens earlier than another thing, so here it means one must take a seat first (at that location) before doing anything else.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "there," which is used as a placeholder indicating the existence or presence of something (in this case, a nurse). The verb "is" agrees with the singular subject, and "a nurse" is a properly formed noun phrase that functions as the direct object of the sentence.
0	The verb "hopes" requires a singular noun as its subject, but "everyone" is plural. Therefore, the correct form of the verb should be "hope." Additionally, there needs to be a preposition linking "everyone" and "to sleep," so the corrected sentence would read: "Everyone hopes for everyone else to get some sleep."
1	The sentence "Everyone hopes that he will sleep" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "everyone," which is a singular, third-person pronoun. Therefore, it requires a singular, third-person verb form following it, such as "hopes." Additionally, the subordinate clause "that he will sleep" contains a coreferential pronoun "he" referring to an unspecified person who is the object of everyone's hope. Overall, the sentence follows standard English grammar rules, making it correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It uses the past perfect tense ("remembered") to indicate that one action (Churchill remembering) happened before another action (Churchill giving the speech), which is appropriate for the intended meaning of the sentence. Additionally, there are no spelling or punctuation errors in the sentence.
0	The verb "promise" requires a base form of the verb that follows it, so the sentence should be "John promised Mary to shave himself." Additionally, "shave" should have an apostrophe indicating possession ("shaves himself"). However, since there was no option for partial credit, I gave 0 as the overall score because even if we fix the first issue, the second one still remains unaddressed.
1	The sentence "John convinced Bill that Mary should sleep" is grammatically correct. It contains a main clause "John convinced Bill" and a subordinate clause "that Mary should sleep." Both clauses contain a subject ("John," "Mary") and a verb ("convinced," "should sleep"). Additionally, the verb tenses agree within each clause and across both clauses. Therefore, there are no grammatical errors in this sentence.
0	This sentence is grammatically incorrect due to a misplaced modifier. The phrase "while you did so Mary" does not make sense in this context because it is unclear what action "you" and "Mary" were doing together. Additionally, there seems to be a missing verb before "Mary." A possible correction could be: "I saw Bill while you were talking to Mary," or "I saw Bill as you both did something."
0	The sentence contains a grammatical error known as a misplaced modifier. In this case, "Bill" is being incorrectly identified as what "Mary did," when it should be connected to the verb phrase "was given." A corrected version of the sentence would read: "What Mary did was give Bill a book" or "Mary gave Bill a book."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple tense verb ("sniffed") and its subject ("bears"). No additional information is provided about the number or type of bears, but that does not make the sentence incorrect.
1	The sentence "to steal talismans from witches is dangerous" is grammatically correct. It consists of an infinitive phrase ("to steal talismans") followed by a linking verb ("is") and an adjective ("dangerous"). There are no grammatical errors or awkward phrasings that would make it difficult for a native speaker to understand the intended meaning. Therefore, I would rate this sentence as being grammatically correct and assign it a score of 1.
0	The sentence "Anson demonized" is grammatically incomplete as it lacks a direct object or an infinitive verb to complete its meaning. For example, one could say "Anson demonized the proposal," or "Anson demonized running for office." Without such additional context, the sentence remains unclear and incomplete.
0	The verb "kick" requires a singular or plural object to show who or what was kicked. In this case, the reflexive pronoun "yourselves" is plural but there is no corresponding singular or plural subject for it to refer back to. A possible correction could be "you kicked yourself," where "yourself" agrees with the singular subject "you."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "The book" is a noun phrase acting as the direct object of the verb "read." * "that I said" is a relative clause modifying the noun "book." It contains the subject "I," which refers to the speaker, and the past tense verb "said," indicating prior speech about the book. * "that I'd never read" is another relative clause modifying the same noun "book." It also contains the subject "I," which refers to the speaker, and the contraction "I'd" (short for "I had"), followed by the negated present perfect participle "never read." This implies that the speaker has not yet read the book even after saying they would do so. Overall, the sentence conveys a complex idea about a specific book using two nested relative clauses to provide additional context and meaning.
0	The verb "demonized" does not agree with its subject "Anson." Additionally, there is no preposition that correctly follows "demonized," making "up" incorrect. Lastly, the phrase "the Khyber" lacks context; it may be a proper noun but needs to be clarified or expanded upon for the sentence to make sense. A corrected version could be: "Anson denounced the situation."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The phrase "it is not true that" negates the possibility of the speaker attending the party, which is expressed using the modal verb "might." This implies a level of uncertainty about whether or not the speaker will actually go to the party.
0	The sentence "Kick you!" is grammatically incorrect because it lacks a subject. A complete sentence requires both a subject and a verb. In this case, the intended meaning seems to be that someone wants to kick the person being addressed, so a more appropriate way to phrase the sentence would be "He kicks you" or "I'll kick you."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Jason," who is performing the action of persuading someone. The indirect object is "the doctor," who is being persuaded by Jason to do something. The direct object is "to treat Medea," which describes what the doctor is being asked to do. All elements are used correctly and flow smoothly in the sentence.
0	The sentence contains a couple of errors. Firstly, there should be no comma after "firstly." Secondly, the verb tense needs to be consistent throughout the sentence - since the subject of the second clause ("you") is the same as that of the first clause, it should also be in the past tense (i.e., "got" instead of "get"). Therefore, the corrected sentence would read: "Who did you describe accurately?"
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "The Peter" is a valid way to refer to a specific person named Peter, although it might sound more natural to say "that Peter" or simply "Peter." However, since "we all like" implies that there may be multiple Peters being referred to here, using "the" could also indicate that only one particular Peter is being discussed - namely, the one who everyone likes. * "was at the party" correctly uses the past tense of the verb "to be," which agrees with its subject "the Peter." Therefore, I would rate this sentence as grammatically correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It consists of a noun phrase ("the government's imposition") and a gerund verb phrase ("of a fine"). Together, these form a complete grammatical structure that can function as a subject or object within a larger sentence. For example, "The government's imposition of a fine was long overdue" would be a complete sentence using this noun phrase as its subject.
1	The sentence "Did Athena help us?" is grammatically correct. It consists of a question tag ("did") followed by the subject ("Athena"), the auxiliary verb ("help"), and the object ("us"). All words are spelled correctly, and there are no punctuation or agreement errors. Therefore, I would rate this sentence as being grammatically correct.
1	The sentence "You wanted to meet the man I saw" is grammatically correct. Here's a breakdown of why it works: * "You" is the subject of the first clause, which is implied but understood as "you wanted something." * "wanted" is the past tense of the verb "to want," indicating that the action occurred before now. It agrees with the singular subject "you." * "to meet" forms an infinitive phrase acting as the direct object of the first clause. This infinitive phrase sets up what was desired or wanted. * "the" acts as a definite article referring to a specific man. * "man" is a noun that serves as the direct object of the second clause (implied by "I saw"). * "I" is the subject of the second clause. * "saw" is the simple past tense form of the verb "to see," indicating that the speaker witnessed the man previously. * Overall, the structure of the sentence uses embedded clauses effectively while maintaining proper grammar rules.
0	The sentence contains a spelling mistake. The word "demonized" should be "denounced." Additionally, if we want to say that Anson criticized David daily, it would be more appropriate to use the present tense (i.e., "Anson denounces David every day"). So the corrected sentence can be either of the following: * Corrected Sentence #1: Anson denounced David every day. * Corrected Sentence #2: Anson denounces David every day.
0	The word "programme" should be spelled as "program." Additionally, it would sound more natural to say "there is a program about Euripides on the radio (specifically, Radio 4) tonight," instead of using the possessive form "Radio 4's."
1	The sentence "Medea denied poisoning the phoenix" is grammatically correct. Here's a breakdown of why it's correct: * "Medea" is a proper noun that refers to a character from Greek mythology, so it is capitalized correctly. * "denied" is a past tense verb indicating that Medea has previously made a denial regarding something. It agrees with the subject "Medea." * "poisoning" is a gerund (verb acting as a noun) used here as the direct object of the sentence, meaning the action performed by Medea. * "the" is a definite article referring to a specific phoenix being discussed. * "phoenix" is a common noun referring to a mythical bird that is said to live for hundreds of years before dying and rising again from its own ashes. Therefore, the sentence is grammatically correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. There are no spelling errors or awkward phrasings that need to be corrected. Additionally, the word choice is appropriate for describing something being concealed underground. Overall, it's a clear and concise sentence.
0	The sentence "Extremely frantically, Anson danced at Trade" is grammatically incorrect because it lacks context about what or where "Trade" refers to. Additionally, there is no verb agreement between the subject (Anson) and the verb (danced). It would be more appropriate to say "Extremely frantically, Anson danced at the trade show."
0	The sentence contains multiple errors that make it difficult to understand. It seems that there are two missing subjects or pronouns for the verbs "ask" and "gave." A possible correction could be: "What (or whom) did Medea ask, and what (or whom) did she give?" This version clarifies that there are two separate actions being described.
1	The sentence "It's Anson that I like" is grammatically correct. In this sentence, "it" is a dummy subject used to form the grammatical structure of the sentence. The real subject is "Anson," which follows the verb "like." This construction is often used when the speaker wants to emphasize the identity of the subject. Therefore, there is no need for any corrections in this sentence.
0	The verb "try" should be followed by an infinitive form of a verb (e.g., "to poison"), but instead it's incorrectly followed by the bare infinitive ("poison"). Additionally, there should be a preposition between "tried" and "the nurse," such as "to." A corrected version could read: "Medea tried to get the nurse to poison her children" or "Medea attempted to poison her children through the nurse."
0	The verb tense used in this sentence is incorrect. It should be "I felt as though I knew you" or "I feel that I know you". In the first option, past continuous tense ("was knowing") would also work. The issue here lies in mixing different tenses without a clear reason for doing so within one coherent thought.
0	The sentence contains a double subject ("he" and "can") which is incorrect in standard English. It should be either "Will he be able to do it?" or "Can he do it?" depending on the intended meaning.
0	This sentence is grammatically incorrect because it lacks a main verb for the subject "I." Additionally, there seems to be a misplaced subordinate clause "that she was happy" which would require its own predicate if used as a separate sentence or rephrased appropriately within the original one.
1	The sentence "Anson believed himself to be handsome" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Anson," which is a proper noun that refers to a person's name. The verb phrase "believed himself to be handsome" contains the past tense form of the linking verb "to believe." Additionally, it uses the reflexive pronoun "himself" correctly as the object of the preposition "of" to indicate that Anson has that belief about himself. Overall, there are no grammatical errors or awkward phrasing in this sentence, making it a suitable candidate for a score of 1.
1	The sentence "We arrived about six o'clock" is grammatically correct. The word "about" functions as an adverb here, indicating that the arrival time was approximately six o'clock. There is no grammatical error or awkward phrasing in this sentence.
0	The verb tense in this sentence is incorrect. "Gilgamesh has fought the dragon" would be grammatically correct because it uses the present perfect tense to indicate that the action of fighting a dragon began in the past and continues up until now (perhaps metaphorically). Alternatively, if Gilgamesh's battle with the dragon was entirely in the past, one could say "Gilgamesh fought the dragon."
0	The reflexive pronoun "himself" is incorrectly used here; it should be a regular subject pronoun instead. A better way to phrase the sentence would be "Anson thought he was happy."
1	The sentence "Fortunately Hermione passed biology" is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("Hermione"), an adverb ("fortunately") that modifies the verb, and a verb phrase ("passed biology"). There are no spelling errors or misplaced words, so it can be understood easily by native speakers of English.
0	The sentence contains a double negative ("might not" and "but"), which can result in confusion about the intended meaning. To maintain proper grammar and clarity, it's better to use either "I might go to the party or I might stay home and wash my hair," or "I am not going to the party because I will be washing my hair."
0	The verb "thought" requires an object pronoun such as "me," not a reflexive pronoun such as "myself." Additionally, using "myself" here implies that the speaker was also involved in whatever action or preference is being referred to, which is unlikely to be true based on the context provided. A corrected version of the sentence would read: "I thought he liked me."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "the butler," which is the person performing the action. The verb is "sent," which describes the action that the subject is doing. The direct object of the sentence is "the poison," which is the thing being acted upon. Finally, "to Dinah" tells us where the action was directed. All of these elements come together to form a complete sentence that is both clear and easy to understand.
0	This sentence contains redundant phrases that make it unnecessarily wordy and difficult to understand. The phrase "happens to" can be removed because it doesn't add any meaning to the sentence. Additionally, the phrase "to seem to be" is also unnecessary as "seems to be" already conveys the same idea. A clearer version of this sentence would be "Jason seems sick."
0	This sentence is grammatically incorrect because it contains a word order error. The proper structure of a question in English requires that the auxiliary verb (in this case, "did") comes before the subject ("you"). Additionally, there seems to be some missing information; a more complete version of the sentence might be something like "What did you ask [them] when you saw [that they were in trouble]?" As it stands, however, the provided sentence does not make sense in English.
1	The sentence "We linguists love to argue" is grammatically correct. It consists of a subject ("we"), a helping verb ("do"), a main verb in its present participle form ("arguing"), and the object of the verb ("to argue"). All elements are used correctly, so no corrections need to be made.
0	The sentence "He can will go" is grammatically incorrect because it contains two auxiliary verbs ("can" and "will") that perform similar functions. In English grammar, we typically use only one auxiliary verb to form a tense or express modality. A possible correction for the original sentence could be "He can go" (which implies ability) or "He will go" (which indicates future time reference).
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect. It should be "How fierce WAS the battle?" or "How fierce IS the battle?" depending on whether one is referring to a past or present battle respectively. In addition, it would also be more natural to say "How intense was/is the battle?" as that is a more common way of expressing such a sentiment in English.
0	The sentence contains a mistake known as a question fragment. It's missing necessary information to form a complete question. A corrected version could be: "Which king did you ask about?" or "Which city did you ask me if that king had invaded?"
0	The sentence contains a few errors. Firstly, "some" is unnecessary before "disgruntled old pigs." Secondly, it should be "these ditches," not "those ditches," since they're presumably referring to specific ditches nearby. Lastly, there's no need for the word "that" after "ditches." A corrected version of the sentence would read as follows: "A group of disgruntled old pigs in these ditches are what humans love to eat." However, even if grammatically correct, the content could still be considered offensive or culturally insensitive due to its reference to eating potentially sentient beings.
0	This sentence is grammatically incorrect because the subject and verb have been reversed - it should be "The monkey is eating the banana." In English, we cannot say that a non-animate object (like a banana) performs actions on animate objects (like monkeys).
0	The sentence lacks necessary context to be considered grammatically correct. It's unclear what or who should be burned. Additionally, using an imperative mood without a clear subject can sometimes lead to confusion. In general, it would be better to include more information in the sentence for clarity. For example, "Burn the leaves!" or "Burn the papers!" would both be complete sentences that convey a specific action involving particular objects.
1	The sentence "It stinks that Aphrodite is omnipotent" is grammatically correct. There are no spelling errors or punctuation issues. Additionally, the word order follows standard English syntax rules. In this sentence, "it" serves as the subject, while "stinks" functions as a linking verb connecting the subject to its complement, which is the clause "that Aphrodite is omnipotent." This clause contains the noun phrase "Aphrodite," which refers to the Greek goddess of love and beauty, and the adjective "omnipotent," meaning all-powerful. Overall, the sentence expresses a negative opinion about Aphrodite's power, but it does so using proper grammar.
1	The sentence "Agamemnon seems to be a maniac" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "Agamemnon" is a proper noun referring to a character from Greek mythology. Proper nouns start with a capital letter. * "seems" is a linking verb connecting the subject ("Agamemnon") to its complement ("a maniac"). * "to be" is an infinitive phrase acting as the complement of the linking verb "seems". It describes the state or condition of the subject. * "a maniac" is a noun phrase functioning as the object complement of the sentence. It provides more information about the subject by describing what kind of person he is. Overall, all the words are spelled correctly, and they follow the rules of grammar. Therefore, I would rate this sentence as grammatically correct and assign it a score of 1.
1	The sentence "Will Anson come to the party?" is grammatically correct. It consists of a question tag "will" followed by the subject "Anson" and the base form of the verb "come". The question is asking whether or not Anson will attend the party. There are no spelling errors, punctuation errors, or grammatical errors in this sentence.
1	The sentence "I wondered who Medea had poisoned" is grammatically correct. Here's a breakdown of why it works: * "I wondered" is in the past tense first-person singular form of the verb "to wonder," indicating that the speaker is expressing curiosity about something that happened in the past. * "who" is a relative pronoun used to introduce a clause that describes someone or something whose identity is unknown or unstated. In this case, it refers to the person (or people) whom Medea poisoned. * "Medea" is a proper noun referring to a character from Greek mythology known for her vengeful actions against those who wronged her, including poisoning individuals. * "had poisoned" is the past perfect tense of the verb "to poison." It indicates that an action was completed before another past action took place. Here, it suggests that whoever Medea poisoned died or suffered harm before some other event occurred. Overall, the sentence conveys a clear meaning without any grammatical errors.
1	The sentence "I inquired when could we leave" is grammatically correct. However, it may sound more natural to say or write "I asked when we could leave." Both "inquire" and "ask" can mean to seek information about something, but "ask" is generally used in everyday conversation, while "inquire" might be considered slightly more formal.
0	The sentence needs a direct object to make it grammatically complete. Currently, we have an action ("kicked") but no clear indication of what was being kicked. A more complete version might be "They kicked the ball."
0	The past tense of "eat" is "ate," so the verb form is correct if we're referring to something that happened in the past. However, the subject ("monkey") and the verb do not agree in number. In present tense, the subject-verb agreement would be "The monkey eats the banana." But since the original sentence is in past tense, it should read "The monkey ATE the banana**s**.**" With the necessary pluralization, the corrected sentence becomes:** Correct Sentence: The monkeys ate the bananas.
0	The correct sentence should be "I would like to **be able** to swim." or simply "I'd like to swim," as the auxiliary verb "could" is unnecessary here since it conveys a similar meaning to "would like."
1	The sentence "I kicked myself" is grammatically correct. It consists of a subject ("I") and a verb ("kicked"), which agrees in number (first person singular). Additionally, it uses the past tense form of the verb appropriately to indicate that the action occurred in the past. Therefore, there are no grammatical errors in this sentence.
0	This sentence is incorrect because "bookcase" is a noun referring to a piece of furniture used for holding books, and it cannot perform the action of running. A more appropriate verb could be "fell," which would indicate that the bookcase has collapsed or tipped over.
1	The sentence "I shaved myself" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "I", which is the person performing the action. The verb is "shaved", which is the past tense of the irregular verb "shave". The object of the sentence is "myself", which refers back to the subject "I". This type of reflexive pronoun is used when the subject and the object refer to the same person. Therefore, the sentence is grammatically correct.
0	The phrase "muscle bound" is actually an adjective that describes someone who has large muscles but is also stiff or awkward due to their size. In this case, it seems that the intended meaning was for Anson to become muscular, so the sentence would need to be rephrased as "Anson became muscular."
