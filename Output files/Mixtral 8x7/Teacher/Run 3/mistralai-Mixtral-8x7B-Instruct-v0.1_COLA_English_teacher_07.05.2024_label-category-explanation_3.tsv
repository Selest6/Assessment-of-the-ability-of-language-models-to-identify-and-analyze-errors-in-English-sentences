label	category	explanation
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct. It follows standard English syntax rules for word order (subject-verb-object) and uses proper verb tense agreement between "sailors" and "rode."
1	Syntax	The sentence "The weights made the rope stretch over the pulley" is grammatically correct. In terms of syntax (the arrangement of words to create meaningful sentences), the sentence follows standard English rules for word order and structure. It consists of a subject ("weights"), a verb ("made"), and two prepositional phrases ("over the pulley," "the rope stretch") that modify the verb. Overall, there are no errors or awkward phrasings in this sentence, making it syntactically sound.
1	Syntax	The sentence "The mechanical doll wriggled itself loose" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * The subject of the sentence is "the mechanical doll," a noun phrase consisting of an article ("the") followed by a noun ("doll"). This noun phrase is modified by an adjective ("mechanical"), describing what kind of doll it is. * The verb of the sentence is "wriggled," a past tense form indicating that the action occurred in the past. It agrees in number (singular) with the subject. * The reflexive pronoun "itself" refers back to the subject of the sentence, showing that the doll performed the action on itself. * Finally, "loose" functions as an adverb modifying how or where the doll wriggled - presumably free from something that was holding it down or together. Overall, the syntax of the sentence follows standard English rules for word order, agreement, and function, making it grammatical.
1	Syntax	The sentence "If you had eaten more, you would want less" is grammatically correct. It follows the standard structure for a conditional statement (if-clause followed by a main clause) and uses proper verb tenses throughout. In particular, it utilizes past perfect tense ("had eaten") in the if-clause to express an action completed before another past time event, and modal verb "would" together with base form of verb "want" in the main clause to indicate hypothetical or unlikely situations.
0	Semantics	The sentence is grammatically correct but semantically incorrect because it suggests a contradiction. It implies that the more someone eats, the less they desire or want something, which goes against our understanding of human behavior. In general, people who eat more tend to want more as well.
0	Semantics	This statement is semantically incorrect because it suggests a negative correlation between wanting something and eating it, when typically there's a positive correlation - if you want something (like food) more, you tend to eat more of it, not less.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a syntactic error known as a split subject-verb agreement. In the clause "the more John eat," the verb "eat" does not agree in number with its subject "John." To fix this issue, we need to change the form of the verb so it agrees with its singular subject, resulting in "the more John eats, the more he pays."
0	Syntax	This sentence contains a coordinating conjunction ("she") that does not properly connect two independent clauses. A comma splice error has occurred here. To fix it, we can either use a semicolon or period before "she," add a conjunction such as "and" after the comma, or split it into two separate sentences. Here's how we could revise it: - Mary listens to the Grateful Dead; she gets depressed. - Mary listens to the Grateful Dead, and she gets depressed. - Mary listens to the Grateful Dead. She gets depressed.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct. It follows a clear subject-verb-object structure. In this case, the subjects are "Mary" and "she", the verbs are "got" and "looked", and the objects are "angrier" (as an adjective modifying the subject) and "pictures". Additionally, there's a correlation between the two clauses using "the angrier" and "the more," making it a semantically coherent comparison as well.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct. Its structure follows standard English syntax rules for subject-verb-object word order, and all elements are used appropriately within the sentence. Additionally, there are no misspelled words or incorrect punctuation marks.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct. It follows standard subject-verb-object word order, uses proper verb tense agreement, and has no spelling or punctuation errors. Additionally, the use of comparative forms ("more" and "less") correctly modifies the adjectives "obnoxious" and "attention," respectively, indicating a gradual increase or decrease along a continuum.
1	Syntax	The sentence "John was lots more obnoxious than Fred" is grammatically correct. In this sentence, "lots more obnoxious" functions as a degree modifier, indicating the extent to which John is obnoxious compared to Fred. This construction is syntactically acceptable and commonly used in informal English. Therefore, there is no syntax error in this sentence.
1	Semantics	This sentence is grammatically correct and semantically meaningful. It conveys a clear message that as the number of people who receive beer increases, the number of people who become ill also rises. Therefore, it's appropriate to assign a score of 1 for this sentence since there are no grammatical or syntactical errors present. Additionally, I categorize it under Semantics because my analysis focuses on evaluating the meaning conveyed by the sentence rather than any other aspect of language use.
1	Semantics	This sentence is semantically correct because it conveys a clear meaning. It suggests a cause-and-effect relationship between two events - Bill smoking more and Susan hating him more as a result. While some may argue that excessive use of "more" can be grammatically incorrect due to repetition, it's commonly used in informal language for emphasis. Therefore, I would classify it under semantic rather than syntactic or morphological rules.
1	Syntax	The sentence provided is grammatically correct and conveys a clear meaning. Therefore, it can be labeled as correct (1). In terms of syntax, all elements of the sentence follow standard rules for word order, punctuation, and structure. For example, the subject ("the more pictures of him that appear in the news") precedes the verb ("becomes"), and there is proper use of articles ("the" and "a"). Overall, no errors or violations of syntactic rules can be identified in this sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Every senator seems to become more corrupt, as he talks to more lobbyists." is grammatically correct. Here's why: * The subject "every senator" agrees with the verb "seems," which indicates a singular subject. * The use of the present participle phrase "as he talks to more lobbyists" correctly modifies the main clause by describing the circumstances under which corruption occurs. * The word order is appropriate for a complex sentence structure. Overall, there are no syntax errors or other issues that would warrant changing the score from 1 (correct) to 0 (incorrect).
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a syntax error due to the misplaced clause "because he likes." In English grammar, dependent clauses such as these must be set off by a comma when they appear in the middle of a sentence. Additionally, it is unclear who or what John visits because of the lack of necessary information. A possible correction could be: "John visits Sally because he likes her," assuming contextual knowledge permits this interpretation.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Marianne did not leave" is grammatically correct. It follows standard English syntax rules for forming a negative sentence using the auxiliary verb "did" and the past tense form of the main verb "leave."
1	Semantics	The sentence "He could not have been working" is grammatically correct. Here, "could not have been working" expresses past unreal conditional mood, indicating a hypothetical or impossible situation in the past related to work by 'he'. Therefore, it falls under semantic analysis since grammar rules are followed accurately but involves interpreting the meaning based on context and tense usage.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a double negative (he can not), which creates confusion and makes it syntactically incorrect. A corrected version could be "He cannot have been working" or "He can't have been working."
1	Syntax	The sentence "You will believe Bob." is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "You" serves as the subject of the sentence, while "will believe" functions as the verb phrase. * "Bob" is a proper noun functioning as the direct object of the sentence. * Therefore, there are no syntactic errors in this sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence "John has not kissed Mary" is grammatically correct. It follows standard English syntax rules for subject-auxiliary verb-not-main verb-object (John-has-not-kissed-Mary). Additionally, there are no errors in morphology or semantics.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows the rules for subject-auxiliary verb inversion in questions, where the auxiliary verb "had" comes before the subject "I." This type of inversion can be used in certain types of subordinate clauses, including those beginning with "never" or other negative adverbs. Additionally, the word order within the noun phrase "a place like Bangor" is correct, and there are no spelling, punctuation, or morphological errors in the sentence.
0	Syntax	In English, we typically use object pronouns (me, you, him, her, it, us, them) after verbs instead of subject pronouns (I, you, he, she, it, we, they). The verb "look up" requires a direct object, but "it" is being used as a subject here. A correct version would be "Mickey looked it up."
1	Syntax	The sentence "There tended to be a lot of discussion." is grammatically correct. The subject-auxiliary inversion ("there tended") is used appropriately for passive voice, and the verb form "tended" agrees with its subject "there". Additionally, there is no ambiguity or incorrect meaning (semantic error), and all morphemes follow regular rules for word formation.
1	Other Category	The sentence "John tried to be a good boy" is grammatically correct. Therefore, it returns 1 for being correct. It does not contain any errors related to syntax (the arrangement of words), semantics (meaningful interpretation), or morphology (structure of individual words). Hence, we can categorize it under 'Other Category'.
1	Other Category	The sentence "John is eager." is grammatically correct because it follows standard subject-verb-object syntax rules (SVO) and has a clear meaning (semantically correct). Additionally, there are no morphological errors such as incorrect verb forms or pluralization issues. Therefore, based on these observations, I would categorize this question under "Other Category" since none of the specific error types appear in the provided sentence.
1	Other Category	The sentence "We want John to win." is grammatically correct. It consists of a main clause ("we want") and an infinitive phrase ("to win"), where "John" is the object of the verb "want" and the subject of the infinitive verb "win". Both syntax (word order) and semantics (meaning) are clear and unambiguous. Therefore, there is no mistake in this sentence.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object (SVO) word order in English. The subject ("the box") comes first, followed by the verb ("contained"), and then the object ("the ball"). Additionally, each phrase contains appropriate articles and prepositions. Therefore, there are no syntactic errors or other issues related to morphology or semantics.
0	Syntax	In English, we say "The tube was escaped from (by) gas," not "The tube was escaped by gas." This is because the verb "escape" requires a preposition such as "from" or "by" when used in the passive voice, and the subject needs to be placed after the auxiliary verb "was". Additionally, the agent performing the action ("gas") usually comes last in a passive construction using "by", but it can sometimes come earlier for emphasis.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Water bubbled up out of the kettle" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of syntax for English sentences. Here's a breakdown: * "Water" is the subject of the sentence. It is a noun that refers to a specific substance. * "bubbled" is the verb of the sentence. It indicates what the subject (water) did. In this case, the water was moving in a way that caused bubbles to form. * "up" is an adverb modifying the verb "bubbled." It tells us the direction in which the action occurred. * "out" is another adverb modifying the verb "bubbled," indicating where the bubbling motion originated from. * "of" is a preposition introducing the prepositional phrase "of the kettle." This phrase functions as an adjective describing what type of water we are talking about. Overall, all these elements work together to create a coherent sentence structure that makes sense in English. Therefore, I would rate the grammaticality of this sentence as 1, meaning it is grammatically correct.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct because it follows standard subject-verb-object (SVO) word order in English. Additionally, the verb tense ("leaked") agrees with the singular subject "the tub." The meaning of the sentence is clear and unambiguous, indicating proper semantic usage. Furthermore, there are no morphological errors such as incorrect inflections or misspelled words. Overall, this sentence demonstrates accurate syntax without any issues in other areas of language study.
1	Syntax	The sentence "What the water did to the bottle was fill it." is grammatically correct. Here, "what" functions as a relative pronoun referring back to the action performed by the water on the bottle, and the verb "was" introduces a subject complement clause ("fill it") that renames or describes the antecedent of "what". Although some people might prefer a slightly different wording such as "The water filled the bottle", there's nothing inherently wrong with using a passive construction here.
1	Syntax	The sentence "What the water did to the whole bottle was fill it." is grammatically correct. It follows the required structure for a cleft sentence, where the subject ("what") is followed by a relative clause ("the water did to the whole bottle"), and then the predicate ("was fill it"). Although some people might prefer using the past tense form "filled" instead of the base form "fill," both forms are acceptable here because they serve different grammatical functions (base form as linking verb complement, past tense as passive participle).
0	Syntax	In English, we don't use "the" before a mass noun (fluid) when it refers generically to its class or type; instead, we omit the article or use "some." Therefore, the corrected sentence would be "The tank leaked fluid freely" or "The tank leaked some fluid," depending on the intended meaning.
1	Syntax	The sentence "John lay the ball in the box" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "John" is a proper noun used as the subject of the sentence. * "lay" is the past tense of the verb "to lie," indicating that the action occurred in the past. * "the ball" is a noun phrase serving as the direct object of the sentence, receiving the action of being laid in the box. * "in the box" is a prepositional phrase modifying the location where the action took place. Overall, the syntax of this sentence follows standard English grammar rules, making it a grammatically correct sentence.
1	Other Category	The sentence "John owns the book." is grammatically correct. Therefore, I am returning a 1 for this example. This error falls outside of syntax, semantics, or morphology because it does not contain any grammatical errors related to those areas.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct. It demonstrates coordinated verb-phrase ellipsis, where a coordinate structure involves two infinitive phrases ("to leave" and "to stay") sharing the same subject ("Mary" and "Sue"). Each clause has its own independent thought, making it clear and unambiguous.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct. It contains a subordinating conjunction ("although") that introduces a dependent clause ("even though the courts didn't actually find Klaus guilty of murder"). This dependent clause modifies the main clause ("Most people probably consider Klaus guilty of murder"), providing additional context for the reader. Additionally, the use of pronouns ("he" and "his") is appropriate, referring back clearly to the antecedent "Klaus." Overall, the syntax of the sentence is clear and concise, making it easy to understand.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Mary beautifully plays the violin" is grammatically correct. In terms of syntax, it follows the standard structure of a simple sentence, consisting of a subject ("Mary"), an adverb ("beautifully") modifying the verb, and a direct object ("the violin").
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a misplaced modifier, "probably." In the current structure, it seems to modify "immediately," but what the speaker likely means is that John is probably going to quickly learn French without error. To convey this meaning correctly, move "probably" before "will": "Clearly, John will probably immediately learn French perfectly."
0	Syntax	In English, we do not use two prepositions (to and a) together in a row when giving something to someone. A more appropriate way to phrase this sentence would be "Sue gave Bill a book." or "Sue gave a book to Bill." The first option is preferred because it follows the typical word order for this type of sentence: subject + verb + direct object + indirect object.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct. Here's why: - "The men" is a noun phrase (NP) where "the" is a definite article and "men" is a plural countable noun. - "will all leave" is a verb phrase (VP) consisting of an auxiliary verb "will" followed by another auxiliary verb "all", and the base form of the main verb "leave". - The NP subject takes the third person plural -s inflection on the main verb "leave" indicating agreement between the subject and the predicate. Therefore, there are no syntax errors in this sentence.
1	Other Category	The sentence "John went home." is grammatically correct. Therefore, it returns a score of 1. Since there are no syntactic or semantic errors, and morphological issues do not apply here as well, we can categorize this question under "Other Category".
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a syntactic error related to word order. In particular, it is unclear whether "seriously" modifies the verb phrase "represented to the dean Mary" or if it describes the manner in which they represented themselves ("they represented themselves seriously"). To fix this issue, we can rephrase the sentence by adding a preposition such as "as": "They represented themselves seriously to the dean as a genuine linguist." Alternatively, we could move "seriously" before the subject-verb pair to clarify its meaning: "Seriously, they represented themselves to the dean Mary as a genuine linguist."
0	Syntax	In English, the subject (the person or thing doing the action) comes before the verb (the action itself), while the object (the person or thing being acted upon) comes after the verb. For example, we say "They love us," not "Us love they." The latter sentence is incorrect because it violates standard English syntax rules for word order by placing the object ("us") before the subject ("they").
1	Other Category	The sentence “It is nice to go abroad” is grammatically correct. Here’s why: * The subject pronoun “it” refers to a general situation or experience. * The verb phrase “is nice” consists of an auxiliary (or helping) verb “is” and the adjective “nice,” which functions as the complement of the linking verb. * The infinitive phrase “to go abroad” serves as the direct object of the verb phrase “is nice.” This phrase indicates the action being described by the adjective “nice.” Overall, the syntax (sentence structure), semantics (meaning), and morphology (word formation) of this sentence are all appropriate for standard written English. Therefore, I have labeled it as category “Other.”
1	Syntax	The sentence "Mary intended John to go abroad" is grammatically correct. In terms of syntax, it follows the standard structure of a sentence (Subject-Verb-Object), where "Mary" is the subject, "intended" is the verb, and "John to go abroad" serves as the object of the sentence. This construction demonstrates a correctly formed subordinate infinitive clause ("to go abroad") functioning as the direct object of the main clause.
1	Syntax	The sentence "I remembered having kissed Mary" is grammatically correct. It follows the rules for subject-verb agreement, word order, and tense consistency. Specifically, the past perfect continuous tense ("remembered having kissed") is used appropriately here to indicate a past action (kissing) that was completed before another past action (remembering). Additionally, there are no grammatical errors or awkward phrasings that would make the sentence difficult to understand. Therefore, it can be considered a well-formed sentence from a syntactic perspective.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct. It uses a coordinating conjunction ("either") to connect two clauses, each containing a subject and a verb. Additionally, the use of the auxiliary verb "will" before "not" (i.e., "won't") correctly forms a contraction for negation in the second clause. Therefore, there are no syntax errors in this sentence.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a syntactic error known as a missing word or phrase. In particular, there is no pronoun or noun indicating what “I” want after wanting to read Fred’s story. A corrected version would be, for example, “John wants to read Fred's story, and I also want to read it.”
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a pronoun "who" without an antecedent (the word it refers back to) clearly stated in the previous part of the sentence. Although it can be implied from context that "someone" could serve as the antecedent for "who," it would still lead to confusion about whether the speaker wants to invite the same person they couldn't decide on or if they want to find another person altogether. To fix this issue, rephrase the sentence so that the pronoun has a clear antecedent, such as: "We wanted to invite someone, but we couldn't decide whom to invite."
1	Syntax	The sentence "Mary will read Fred's story, and Joe will read Holly's." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of syntax for forming a complete sentence in English. It contains a subject ("Mary" and "Joe") and a verb ("will read"), and clearly expresses two separate actions that will be performed in the future. Additionally, each subject possesses a noun using the appropriate possessive form (Fred's and Holly's), which functions as the direct object of its respective clause. Overall, there are no grammatical errors or awkward constructions in this sentence.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a syntactic error known as a run-on sentence or a comma splice. This occurs when two independent clauses (clauses that can stand alone as complete sentences) are connected only by a comma. In this case, "Mary claimed that eating cabbage" and "Holly shouldn't" are both independent clauses. To fix the issue, we could use a period instead of a comma, making it two separate sentences, or add a conjunction such as "but" after the comma. For example: "Mary claimed that eating cabbage, but Holly shouldn't." Alternatively, "Mary claimed that eating cabbage was something Holly shouldn't do." would be grammatically correct while preserving some connection between the two ideas.
0	Syntax	The verb tense used in the second part of the sentence is inconsistent with the first part. "Came" in the second half of the sentence should agree with "came" in the first half, so it should be changed from "I also came to be" to "I also came." This way both verbs will match in past tense.
1	Syntax	The sentence "If I can, I will work on it." is grammatically correct. Here's why: * The if-clause "if I can" sets up a conditional relationship between two actions. This construction follows standard syntactic rules for conditionals in English. * The subject-verb agreement is correct in both clauses ("I can," "I will work"). * The word order (SOV) in the subordinate clause "I can" is typical of questions but may be used in certain types of statements such as conditions or exclamations. * Overall, there are no grammatical errors in terms of syntax, morphology, semantics, or any other category.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Joe's neuroses bother his patrons, and Sally does too" is grammatically correct. It uses a construction called ellipsis, where a word or phrase is left out because it has already been mentioned earlier in the sentence. In this case, "does too" refers back to "bothers," so we understand that Sally's behavior bothers people as well. This type of ellipsis is allowed in informal writing and speech, and helps make the sentence more concise without losing its meaning.
0	Semantics	The sentence is grammatically correct but semantically unclear. It is ambiguous whether "which book Lilly did it for him" refers to a book that both José and Lilly were supposed to read or if it means Lilly took another action related to the book on behalf of José. To avoid confusion, two separate sentences can be used instead: (1) "I know which book José didn't read for class." And (2) "I know that Lilly read the book he was supposed to read for class."
0	Semantics	The second sentence contains a pronoun "it" without a clear antecedent. It is unclear what "it" refers to, making the sentence difficult to understand. Therefore, I would rate this sentence as having incorrect semantics.
1	Syntax	The sentence appears to be grammatically correct. It contains a compound predicate ("I know...Mag read" and "Bob said...you hadn't") connected by the conjunction "and." Additionally, each clause has a clear subject and verb, and proper punctuation is used throughout. Therefore, there are no syntax errors present in this sentence.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a misplaced modifier, "that you hadn't." It is unclear what "that you hadn't" is intended to modify in the original sentence. A corrected version could be: "I know which book Mag read, and which book Bob read before you did (your report)."
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows the standard structure of a complex sentence, consisting of an independent clause ("I'm sure I would like him to eat fruit") and a dependent clause ("more than I would cookies"). Both clauses contain the necessary subject-verb agreement, and there are no misspelled words or incorrect punctuation marks. Additionally, the comparison between two things (fruit vs. cookies) using "more than" is semantically appropriate. Therefore, the sentence can be considered syntactically accurate.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Rusty talked about himself only after Mary did talk about him" is grammatically correct. It follows the rules for syntax, or word order, correctly. In this case, each clause (Rusty talked about himself; Mary did talk about him) has a subject ("Rusty," "Mary") followed by a verb ("talked"). Additionally, the coordinating conjunction "only" separates these two clauses properly, showing their relationship to one another.
0	Syntax	The repetition of the word 'talk' is unnecessary because it creates a redundancy in the sentence. A more appropriate way to phrase it would be as follows: "Fred talked about everything before Rusty did." This revised version eliminates the repeated verb and maintains the intended meaning.
1	Other Category	The sentence "John often meets Mary." is grammatically correct. Therefore, I am returning a 1 for this example. This category falls under other since there are no errors related to syntax, semantics, or morphology in this sentence.
0	Syntax	In standard English, it is more common to say "The problem is perceived easily" rather than "The problem perceives easily." The latter sentence implies that the problem has agency and can perceive things, which is not grammatically or logically correct in most contexts. Therefore, the original sentence is incorrect due to a syntax error.
1	Syntax	The sentence "A hundred men surrounded the fort" is grammatically correct. In terms of syntax (the arrangement of words to create meaningful sentences), there are no errors in subject-verb agreement or word order. The noun phrase "a hundred men" serves as the subject, and the verb "surrounded" correctly agrees with it in number. Additionally, the prepositional phrase "of the fort" adds more information about where the action took place without interrupting the flow of the sentence. Therefore, I would rate this sentence as syntactically correct.
0	Syntax	In standard English, we use the passive voice for a sentence like "I was elected" rather than the active voice ("we elected me"). This is because election results do not typically result from the actions of those who are being elected. However, there are contexts where it might make sense to say "We elected me," such as if someone has been chosen by their group to take on a particular role or responsibility. Without additional context, though, I would assume that this sentence contains a syntax error.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a misplaced relative pronoun "that." A noun or pronoun must come before a relative clause, but in this case, there is no clear antecedent for "that" to refer back to. It seems like it might be intended to modify "report," but grammatically speaking, it's unclear what "he submitted" is supposed to apply to. To fix the syntax error, we could rephrase the sentence as follows: "Which report, indicating his incompetence, did he submit?"
1	Syntax	The sentence "Mary has always preferred lemons to limes." is grammatically correct. In terms of syntax, it follows the standard structure for a comparative statement, with the subject ("Mary"), auxiliary verb ("has preferred"), comparison object ("lemons"), comparator ("to"), and second comparison object ("limes").
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a syntactic error because there is no noun or pronoun linking "which were whining" to the rest of the sentence. A possible correction could be "He let the cats that were whining out." Alternatively, if we want to keep using "which," it would have to refer back to a specific set of cats already introduced in the discourse. For example: "The cats had been meowing for hours when he finally decided to let the ones which were whining out."
1	Other Category	The sentence "What did Bill buy?" is grammatically correct. It is a question asking about a past action performed by someone named Bill. The word "what" functions as the subject of the sentence, while "did" is an auxiliary verb used to form questions in the simple past tense, and "Bill" is the object of the verb "buy." Therefore, there are no syntax, semantic, or morphological errors in this sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Mary saw the boy walking toward the railroad station." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules for English syntax (word order). In this case, the subject ("Mary") comes before the verb ("saw"), and the object ("the boy") comes after the verb but before the participle phrase ("walking toward the railroad station"). This structure creates a clear and coherent meaning.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a subject-verb agreement error. The verb "give" does not agree in number with its plural subject "a proof." It should be changed to "were given" so that it agrees with its plural subject. Additionally, there is a missing article before "John," making the corrected sentence read as follows: "A proof that the claim had been made was **given** by the fact that John had lied." However, even after fixing these errors, the sentence remains somewhat unclear, suggesting potential issues with semantic coherence or pragmatics beyond simple grammar rules.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains multiple issues with word order and phrasing that make it difficult to understand. A corrected version could be: "He attributed the fire that destroyed most of my factory to a short circuit caused by an overloaded transducer."
0	Syntax	The problem with this sentence lies in its syntax, specifically with subject-verb agreement. In this case, "the proposal" is singular, so it requires a singular verb form such as "is." Therefore, the correct version of this sentence would be: "The mayor regards as absurd the proposal to build a sidewalk from Dartmouth to Smith."
1	Syntax	The sentence "I want that Bill left to remain a secret." is grammatically correct. In terms of syntax, it follows the standard structure of a sentence, consisting of a subject ("I"), a verb ("want"), and an object clause ("that Bill left to remain a secret"). Additionally, the word order within each phrase is appropriate, making the overall sentence coherent and easy to understand.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a syntactic error because it has two instances of the verb "drives" right after each other without any intervening words or phrases. This creates a repeated subject-verb structure ("I know a man...Tom drives...") that is ungrammatical in standard English. To fix the issue, we could replace one instance of "drives" with another verb (e.g., "follows," "accompanies") or add some additional context to clarify the intended meaning (e.g., "I know a man whom Tom drives home as he usually does").
0	Syntax	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in this sentence. "Drowning cats" is a plural noun, but it does not agree with the singular verb form "is." It should be "drown" instead of "is," so the corrected version would read as follows: "Drowning cats, which is against the law, are hard to rescue" should be "Drowning cats, which is against the law, are hard to rescue." However, since there is still a mismatch between "drowning" (plural) and "which is" (singular), we must revise further: "Cats drowning, which is against the law, are difficult to rescue."
1	Syntax	The sentence "Muriel said nothing else than that she had been insulted" is grammatically correct. It contains a correlative conjunction "not only...but also", where "nothing else" corresponds to "but also". This construction emphasizes that Muriel's statement was limited to having been insulted. In other words, Muriel didn't say anything beyond stating that she had been insulted.
0	Semantics	The sentence contains a semantic error because it suggests that Rutherford understands himself, when what was likely intended was for Rutherford to be the understander rather than the one being understood. A corrected version could read as follows: "Rutherford understands himself."
1	Other Category	The sentence "I feel that Arch will show up" is grammatically correct, but it may be semantically awkward depending on the context. The verb "feel" can mean both physical sensations (e.g., "I feel a headache coming on") as well as emotional states or opinions (e.g., "I feel sad today"). In this case, using "feel" as an expression of opinion might sound odd if there's no clear reason for expressing uncertainty about whether Arch will appear. Instead, a more neutral statement could be used, such as "I think Arch will show up." However, since the grammar itself is technically correct, we would classify this under "Other Category".
0	Syntax	The subject-verb agreement rule in English states that a singular subject requires a singular verb and a plural subject requires a plural verb. In this case, the subject "the proof" is singular, but the verb "is" is plural. It should be replaced with the singular form "is", so the correct version would read: "The proof *is* difficult to find."
0	Syntax	This sentence has a syntactic error because it lacks clarity about which noun ("the lute" or "sings") the relative pronoun "which" refers to. Additionally, there should be a conjunction such as "and" between the two verb phrases "plays the lute" and "sings." A corrected version could read: "The madrigals that Henry plays on the lute and for which he sings sound terrible."
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct. Each clause follows subject-verb agreement rules and has a clear subject and predicate. Additionally, punctuation is used correctly to separate each independent clause.
0	Syntax	The sentence provided contains a syntactic error known as a run-on or fused sentence. It consists of two independent clauses ("Where did you go" and "who ate what") without proper punctuation or conjunction between them. To fix this issue, we can either insert appropriate punctuation (e.g., a period) and start a new sentence for the second clause, add a semicolon before the second clause, or include a coordinating conjunction such as 'and' after adding a comma. Here are examples of corrected versions: * Corrected Version 1: Where did you go? Who ate what? * Corrected Version 2: Where did you go; who ate what? * Corrected Version 3: Where did you go, and who ate what?
0	Syntax	The sentence contains multiple syntactic errors. Specifically, there is a missing determiner before both instances of "boy" and "president," making it unclear who or what is being referred to. Additionally, the phrase "guardian's employer" seems out of place and does not contribute meaningfully to the overall structure of the sentence. A possible corrected version could be: "Whose boy did we elect as the president of the guardian's company?" However, without further context, it is difficult to determine the intended meaning of the original sentence.
0	Semantics	The sentence contains a spelling error ("how sane is Peter?"). However, even if we correct the spelling mistake, there would still be a semantic issue because the word "sane" does not make sense in this context without additional information about what aspect of Peter's sanity is being questioned (e.g., "How sane does Peter seem to be lately?" or "How sane is Peter compared to his brother?")
1	Syntax	The sentence appears to be grammatically correct. It contains two independent clauses joined by the coordinating conjunction "and". Each clause has a subject ("I" and "my dad") and a predicate verb phrase ("live at the place where Route 150 crosses the River" and "lives at the place where Route 150 crosses the Hudson River"). Additionally, each clause includes additional prepositional phrases that provide more information about the location. Overall, the syntax of the sentence follows standard English rules for word order and structure.
0	Syntax	The pronoun 'it' in the second clause refers to 'the place', but 'Route 150 crosses the Hudson River' is a description of the location rather than the name of the place itself. Therefore, using 'it' here can be confusing as the reader may wonder what specific place the speaker is referring to. To make the sentence clearer, consider replacing 'it' with 'that same place'.
0	Syntax	The phrase "to make up to" is not grammatically correct in standard English. It seems like there might be a confusion between "make up to someone" and "make up to something." In this context, it appears that what was intended was "make amends with," so a more appropriate way to phrase the question would be "Who is she trying to make amends with now?" or "Who is she trying to reconcile with now?"
0	Syntax	The sentence contains two errors related to verb agreement and voice. The past participle "gotten" should be replaced by the simple past tense form "grew," as it follows the subject "wind." Additionally, the passive construction "was gotten" should be changed to active voice for clarity and precision. A corrected version could read: "The wind grew from a plot to negotiate an honorable end to the war in Vietnam."
1	Syntax	The sentence "Mike talked about politics yesterday to my friends" is grammatically correct. In terms of syntax (the arrangement of words to create meaningful sentences), it follows standard English word order, where a sentence typically consists of a subject ("Mike"), verb ("talked"), and object or complement ("about politics"). Additionally, adverbs such as "yesterday" usually appear towards the end of a clause but can sometimes come earlier for emphasis; here, its positioning after "politics" provides additional information regarding when the conversation took place without disrupting the flow of the sentence. Lastly, prepositional phrases led by "to," including the indirect object "my friends," tend to occur later within clauses, further supporting the syntactical soundness of the provided example.
1	Semantics	The sentence is grammatically correct and conveys a clear meaning without any ambiguity or error. Here's how we can break down each component of the sentence: * "It" refers to a previously mentioned situation or event related to firing teachers. * "was expected" indicates that people anticipated something happening. * "by the reporters" specifies who had the expectation. * "that" introduces a subordinate clause expressing what was expected. * "the principal" is the subject of the subordinate clause. * "would fire" indicates future tense action (firing) initiated by the principal. * "some teacher" identifies the direct object being fired. Therefore, there are no syntax, morphological, semantic, or other category issues with this sentence.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a pronoun error. The pronoun "she" is used instead of "he" to refer to Mike. This creates confusion as to who is being referred to. Changing "she" to "he" would make the sentence grammatically correct. Therefore, the sentence has incorrect syntax due to the use of the wrong pronoun.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a double negative ("didn't" and "never"), which results in an incorrect meaning. It can be corrected by saying either "Which girl did Mike quip ever wore this hat?" or "Which girl did Mike never say wears this hat?" depending on what is intended (past tense vs present tense).
1	Syntax	The sentence “We donated wire for the convicts to build cages with” is grammatically correct. It has a clear subject (“we”), verb (“donated”), and object (“wire”) and follows the rules of English syntax. Additionally, it contains prepositional phrases (“for the convicts,” “to build cages with”) that provide additional information about the action described by the verb. These elements work together to form a coherent and well-structured sentence.
0	Morphology	The verb "have" does not agree with its subject "I" in number. It should be "won't have any money" or "don't have some money." In present tense, we use "has" for third person singular subjects (he, she, it) and "have" for all other cases. However, when using a contraction such as "won't," the base form of the verb is used regardless of the subject.
1	Semantics	The sentence "Do you believe the claim that somebody was looking for something?" is grammatically correct and semantically meaningful. It has a clear syntactic structure, appropriate morphological forms, and makes sense in context. Therefore, there are no errors or issues related to syntax, morphology, or other grammatical components. However, I cannot evaluate whether the specific belief expressed by the sentence is true or false without additional information about the situation being referred to.
1	Semantics	The sentence is grammatically correct but has a problem with semantic meaning. Specifically, there is redundancy in using both "give" and "any money". It would be more appropriate to say "he tried to force me to give her money." Alternatively, if the intent was to emphasize the amount of money, it could be rephrased as "he tried to force me to give her any amount of money."
1	Syntax	The sentence "That Sam sometimes didn't sleep must have pleased somebody" is grammatically correct. It has a subject ("that"), a verb ("must have pleased"), and an object ("somebody"). Additionally, it uses the past tense consistently and employs proper punctuation. Therefore, there are no syntax errors or other issues related to morphology or semantics in this sentence.
0	Syntax	The pronoun used for the object position (in this case, "himself") should refer back to a previously mentioned noun or pronoun that serves as its antecedent. In the sentence "I talked to Winston about himself," there is no clear antecedent for "himself." It would be more appropriate to say "I talked to him about Winston" if referring to two separate individuals, or "I talked to Winston about himself" if Winston has already been established as the topic of conversation.
0	Syntax	The first issue with this sentence is related to subject-verb agreement. In the clause "that the fuzz wanted him worried", "wanted" should agree with its singular subject "the fuzz". However, it does not make sense for a plural noun ("fuzz") to want something from a singular pronoun ("him"). A possible correction could be changing "fuzz" into a singular form such as "fuzzy person" or making both "fuzz" and "him" plural. The second issue relates to word order and case marking on pronouns. It is unclear who exactly was worried by the fuzz because there is no clear relationship between the verb "worried" and either "John" or "Mary". To clarify the intended meaning, we need to rephrase the sentence so that the relationships among all elements become more explicit. For example: Corrected version: The fuzz wanted to worry John, but they did not have the same effect on Mary.
0	Syntax	The coordinating conjunction 'if' is used incorrectly in this sentence. It should connect two grammatically equal parts, but here it tries to link a subject ('Sam') to a verb phrase ('will be working'), making the sentence ungrammatical. A corrected version could be: 'I'll work on it if Sam does too.'
0	Syntax	The verb tense is inconsistent in this sentence. Specifically, the past tense ("chased") does not agree with the present tense ("run"). It should be either "The cat the dog chased ran away" or "The cat that the dog is chasing runs away," depending on whether the action occurred in the past or is currently occurring.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a preposition error. It should be "Here's a knife for you to cut up the onions with." Instead of placing "with" after "for," it should come after the verb phrase "cut up the onions."
0	Semantics	The sentence contains a semantic error related to negation scope. Specifically, it seems as if "which not everybody knows" refers to the fact that Fluffy is sick, but what's actually meant is that "not everybody knows that Fluffy is sick." Therefore, a possible correction would be: "Fluffy is sick, something that not everyone knows."
0	Semantics	The sentence "Maxwell is quite a doctor" is grammatically correct but semantically odd because it implies that Maxwell has some qualities that make him more than just an ordinary doctor, which may or may not be true based on context. In general, we don't use the word "quite" to describe someone as a professional unless they have exceptional abilities or qualifications beyond what is expected for their profession. A better way to phrase this sentence would be "Maxwell is a very skilled doctor" if he indeed possesses such skills.
0	Syntax	This sentence contains a redundant word "and" after "tall". A corrected version would be: "The younger woman might have been tall and the older one definitely was blond."
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct. It consists of two independent clauses ("Sally is tall, and may be blond" and "Sheila is short, and definitely is, blond") connected by a coordinating conjunction ("and"). Each clause contains a subject and a predicate, and follows standard English syntax rules for word order and structure. Additionally, the use of punctuation (commas) within each clause helps clarify meaning and separate phrases appropriately.
0	Syntax	The verb "try" needs to be followed by a base form of the verb (e.g., "I try to finish"). Therefore, it should be "I have to try finishing grading some papers." or "I have to try to finish grading some papers."
0	Syntax	This sentence contains a redundancy error in the phrase "for for". In English grammar, we only use "for" once when expressing purpose or possession. A corrected version could read: "The socks are ready for you to put on to plan." However, even with this correction, the revised sentence still has awkward wording. It would sound more natural as: "The socks are ready for you to put on," if the intended meaning is that they're prepared to wear; or "The socks are ready to be planned," if the intention is to indicate planning related to the socks themselves (such as deciding which pairs go together).
1	Syntax	The sentence “It is easy to play sonatas on this violin” is grammatically correct. In this sentence, the subject is “it,” which refers to the ability or ease of playing sonatas on the violin. The predicate consists of the verb phrase “is easy.” This verb agrees with its singular subject in number and person. The infinitive phrase “to play sonatas on this violin” functions as the direct object of the sentence, providing more information about what it is easy to do. Overall, the syntax of this sentence follows standard English rules for word order, agreement, and function.
1	Syntax	The sentence "This violin is difficult to play sonatas on." is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "This violin" is a noun phrase functioning as the subject of the sentence. * "is" is a linking verb connecting the subject to its complement. * "difficult to play sonatas on" is a predicate adjective phrase describing the subject. It contains the word "difficult," which modifies the infinitival phrase "to play sonatas on." * The preposition "on" introduces the prepositional phrase "on sonatas," which functions as an adverbial indicating where the action takes place. The sentence has a complex structure but all parts fit together correctly.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a syntactic error. Specifically, there is a missing conjunction between "please" and "my father." A corrected version would be: "My mother is easy to please both my father and..." Alternatively, if only one parent is being referred to, it could simply be: "My mother is easy to please."
1	Syntax	The sentence provided is grammatically correct. It contains a coordinating conjunction ("and") linking two independent clauses together, creating a compound sentence. Each clause has a subject (Bill, it) and predicate (had started to rain, had no umbrella), making them both complete thoughts. Therefore, there is nothing wrong from a syntactic perspective.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a misplaced modifier, "that robbery." A modifier should be placed as close as possible to the word or phrase it modifies. In this case, "that robbery" seems intended to modify "it," but "it" has already been specified as something the police discussed with the janitor. Therefore, the meaning of the sentence becomes unclear due to the misplaced modifier. This error falls under syntax because proper sentence structure requires correct placement of words within a clause or sentence.
0	Syntax	The error in this sentence lies in subject-verb agreement. The subject "Every student" is plural, but the verb "is" is singular. It should be changed to "are." Additionally, there is a comma splice between "he" and "wears," as well as unnecessary commas around "and he." A corrected version would read: "Every student who wears socks is a swinger."
1	Syntax	The sentence "That girl was given my binoculars by him" is grammatically correct. In terms of syntax, it follows the rules for word order and structure in a well-formed English sentence. The subject of the sentence is "that girl," the verb is "was given," and the direct object is "my binoculars." The prepositional phrase "by him" provides additional information about who performed the action. Therefore, there are no errors in this sentence related to syntax.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Bill didn't allege that Roger had eaten anything" is grammatically correct. The negation "didn't" correctly negates the verb "allege." The clause "that Roger had eaten anything" functions as the direct object of the sentence, providing additional information about what Bill did not allege. Additionally, the subject-verb agreement is correct (Bill is singular and "didn't allege" is a singular form). Therefore, there are no syntax errors in this sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows standard subject-verb-object word order, uses proper punctuation, and has no spelling errors or ambiguous pronoun references. Additionally, it utilizes a correlative conjunction ("not only...but also") correctly, making its syntax sound natural and fluent for native speakers.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct. Here's a breakdown of the syntax: * Everybody (subject) * around here (adverbial phrase modifying the subject) * who (relative pronoun introducing a relative clause) * ever (adverb modifying the verb in the relative clause) * buys (verb in the present tense, third-person singular, agreeing with the subject everybody) * anything (direct object) * on credit (prepositional phrase modifying the direct object) * talks (verb in the present tense, third-person singular, agrees with the subject everybody) * in his sleep (prepositional phrase modifying the verb talks). Therefore, there are no syntax errors in this sentence.
0	Semantics	The sentence contains a logical error. The phrase "the name of somebody" implies that there is only one specific person being referred to, but the clause "who had misgivings" suggests that multiple people could fit this description. Therefore, it would be more appropriate to say "I can't remember the names of some people who had misgivings."
1	Semantics	The sentence is grammatically correct but semantically odd because it suggests that there's a specific group of people who are writers and playwrights and they never meet in Vienna. It would be more natural to say "No writer or playwright meets in Vienna" if what is meant is that neither type of person ever meets there. However, without additional context, it is difficult to determine whether the original sentence is being used metaphorically or has some other intended meaning.
0	Semantics	The sentence contains a semantic error because it lacks context or information about what kind of people ("no writer" and "any playwright") are being referred to who meet (or don't meet) in Vienna. Additionally, without specifying when these individuals would be meeting, the statement appears vague and open-ended. To fix the issue, more specific details could be added to clarify the intended meaning. For example, "No contemporary writers or playwrights currently reside in Vienna."
0	Semantics	The sentence contains a logical fallacy known as undistributed middle term. This error occurs when there are two terms (marry and student) connected by a linking word or phrase (any), but only one of those terms shares a characteristic or relationship with the other. In this case, it's unclear what aspect of being a student would lead someone to believe they could be married to the speaker, making the statement confusing and misleading.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Felicia kicked the ball off the bench" is grammatically correct. In this sentence, the subject (Felicia) kicks the direct object (the ball) off the prepositional phrase (off the bench). This sentence follows standard syntax rules for English and does not contain any errors in morphological form or semantic meaning.
1	Syntax	The sentence “I sent the package halfway around the world” is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of English syntax. In this sentence, the subject (I) is followed by a verb (sent) and its direct object (the package), and then there is an adverb phrase (halfway around the world) modifying the verb. This structure is consistent with standard English syntax.
0	Syntax	The phrase "out of" creates a prepositional phrase that functions as an adverb modifying the verb "gave." However, it suggests that the ball was already outside of the basket before being given away. To indicate that Sam retrieved the ball from inside the basket prior to giving it away, use the phrasing "Sam took the ball out of the basket and then gave it away" or "Sam gave the ball that he had taken out of the basket."
1	Syntax	The sentence "Sam offered the ball out of the basket" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "Sam" is a proper noun and serves as the subject of the sentence. * "offered" is the verb, indicating past tense action. * "the ball" is the direct object of the sentence, receiving the action from the verb. * "out of the basket" describes where the action originated, serving as a prepositional phrase modifying the verb. This use of "out of" followed by a preposition is acceptable and clear. Therefore, no errors exist in terms of syntax.
1	Other Category	The sentence "Park Square has a festive air" is grammatically correct. It consists of a subject ("Park Square") and a predicate ("has a festive air"). Both nouns (Park Square, air) and the verb (has) agree in number, making it syntactically sound. Additionally, there's no ambiguity or logical fallacy present in the statement, rendering it semantically valid as well. Lastly, all morphemes within the words comply with their respective rules; thus, morphological accuracy is achieved too.
1	Other Category	This sentence is grammatically correct. It consists of a subject ("the worker") and a predicate ("will have a job"). The verb tense used here is future tense, indicating that the action (having a job) has yet to occur but is expected to happen in the future. No errors in syntax, semantics or morphology can be found within this sentence.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a grammatical error known as an agreement problem between subject and verb. In this case, "can" does not agree with its plural subject "no one." A grammatically correct version would be "No one can forgive those comments to you."
1	Syntax	The sentence "We launched the rocket to the moon, but it blew up before it got there" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of English syntax. It has a subject ("we"), a verb ("launched"), and an object ("the rocket") in the first clause, followed by another independent clause connected by a conjunction ("but"). Each clause contains a complete thought, making the overall structure clear and easy to understand. Additionally, the word order is appropriate for each clause, allowing for proper tense agreement between verbs and their subjects. Therefore, no corrections need to be made to this sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Sarah promised Catherine her old car, but then gave it to her son instead." is grammatically correct. It follows the rules for word order and arrangement in English grammar. In addition, each word is spelled correctly and all necessary punctuation marks are present. Therefore, there are no syntactic errors in this sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence "I lent the book partway to Tony" is grammatically correct. The verb tense is consistent (past tense), and the subject-verb agreement is correct. Additionally, there is a clear object ("the book") and indirect object ("Tony"). The word "partway," while unusual as an adverb in this context, could be interpreted as meaning that the action was only partially completed or done for a short period. However, it might sound more natural to say "I lent the book to Tony partway through." Nonetheless, the original sentence remains grammatical, albeit potentially ambiguous.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct because it follows standard subject-verb-object word order (SVO) in English ("The farmer" as the subject, "loaded" as the verb, and "the cart with apples" as the object). Additionally, there are no apparent morphological or semantic errors in the sentence.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct because it follows standard English syntax rules for word order. In this case, the subject ("the farmer") performs the action ("dumped"), which is directed towards the object ("the cart with apples"). Both the verb and its complement ("the cart with apples") agree in number (singular), making the sentence syntactically sound.
0	Semantics	The sentence "Martha carved the baby a toy out of wood" contains a semantic error because it implies that Martha carved the baby instead of the toy for the baby. A corrected version would be "Martha carved a toy out of wood for the baby."
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object (SVO) word order in English. The subject ("the bread") is followed by a verb ("cuts") that agrees in number with the subject, and there is a complement ("easily"), which modifies the verb. Additionally, the words are arranged in a logical way that allows for easy understanding.
0	Syntax	The verb "break" requires a direct object that denotes something breakable (e.g., "Janet broke the vase"). Here, "Bill" cannot be the direct object because people can't typically serve as direct objects for breaking actions. Additionally, "on the finger" creates ambiguity since it could mean either location or instrument; however, even if we interpret it as meaning "using her finger," there would still need to be a direct object denoting what was broken.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Janet broke the cup." is grammatically correct. In terms of syntax, it has a clear subject ("Janet"), a verb ("broke") and an object ("the cup"). The word order follows the standard SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) pattern found in English.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct because it follows standard subject-verb-object (SVO) word order and all words are used appropriately within their respective parts of speech. Additionally, there are no obvious spelling or punctuation errors present in the sentence.
0	Syntax	The sentence "We pulled free" is syntactically incorrect because it lacks a direct object or a preposition indicating what was pulled free. A more complete version could be "We pulled ourselves free."
1	Syntax	The sentence "That movie always shocks people" is grammatically correct because it follows standard English syntax rules for word order and structure. In this sentence, the subject ("that movie") precedes the verb ("shocks"), followed by its direct object ("people"). Additionally, the adverb ("always") is placed appropriately within the sentence to modify the verb. Overall, there are no errors in grammar or usage in this sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence "That movie always shocks" is grammatically correct. The subject "that movie" is followed by the appropriate verb tense "shocks." Additionally, there is no missing or extra punctuation marks, making the syntax of this sentence correct.
0	Syntax	In English, we usually use the structure "come into a room" or "enter a room", rather than just saying "come the room". The word "the" indicates that the listener already knows what specific room is being referred to, so it's unnecessary to include another preposition such as "into" or "in". However, without either of those prepositions, the sentence becomes ungrammatical because there needs to be some indication of movement towards or entry into the room. Therefore, the corrected sentence could be "Sharon entered the room" or "Sharon came into the room."
1	Other Category	The sentence "Bill sent a package to Tom." is grammatically correct because it follows standard English syntax rules for constructing sentences (Subject-Verb-Object). It has no morphological or semantic errors as all words used are correctly spelled and make logical sense in context. Therefore, I have labeled it as 1, indicating its grammatical accuracy.
1	Syntax	The sentence "That acorn will grow into an oak tree." is grammatically correct. It follows standard subject-verb-object word order (SVO), where "that acorn" is the subject, "will grow" is the verb phrase, and "into an oak tree" is a prepositional phrase acting as the object complement. Additionally, all elements within the sentence agree in number, tense, and meaning.
1	Syntax	The sentence "He turned into a frog." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules for English syntax. The subject "he" agrees with the verb "turned," and the preposition "into" introduces the noun phrase "a frog," creating a clear and coherent meaning. The word order is appropriate, and there are no grammatical errors or awkward constructions that would make the sentence difficult to understand. Overall, the sentence demonstrates proper syntactic structure and usage.
1	Syntax	The sentence "I mixed the sugar into the butter." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a simple sentence in English (Subject-Verb-Object). In this case, the subject is "I", the verb is "mixed", and the object is "the sugar". Additionally, the prepositional phrase "into the butter" modifies the verb by telling us where the action occurred.
0	Syntax	The sentence "Brian threw the fence with the stick" is syntactically incorrect because it implies that Brian used the fence as a tool or instrument to throw something else with, which does not make logical sense. A more appropriate way to phrase this would be "Brian threw the stick at the fence."
1	Syntax	The sentence "Mira condemned Terry for the accident" is grammatically correct because it follows standard English syntax rules. In this case, the subject (Mira) performs the action (condemned) on the direct object (Terry), followed by a preposition (for) introducing the reason or cause (the accident). All elements have been used correctly according to their grammatical function, making the sentence syntactically sound.
1	Syntax	The sentence “We investigated the area for bombs” is grammatically correct. In this sentence, “we” is the subject, “investigated” is the verb, “the area” is the direct object, and “for bombs” is a prepositional phrase acting as an adverbial indicating the purpose of the investigation. All elements are correctly structured according to English syntax rules.
1	Syntax	The sentence "I sensed his eagerness" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "I", followed by a verb tense form of "sense". The object is "his eagerness," which follows the transitive verb "sensed." This creates a complete thought, making it syntactically sound.
1	Syntax	The sentence “They praised the dedication in the volunteers” is grammatically correct. Here’s why: * “They” is a plural subject pronoun referring to more than one person. * “praised” is the past tense of the verb “to praise,” indicating that the action has already been completed. * “the dedication” refers to a specific instance or example of dedication. It serves as the direct object of the sentence, receiving the action of being praised from the subject. * “in the volunteers” modifies “dedication” by describing where it can be found. This prepositional phrase functions as an adjective phrase, answering the question “Which volunteers?” by specifying their dedication rather than themselves. Overall, the syntax of this sentence follows standard English rules for word order and structure, making it a grammatical sentence.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject ("the earth") is followed by a verb ("was believed") and a complement clause ("to be round"). The word order follows standard English syntax rules for declarative sentences.
1	Other Category	The sentence "Sarah smiled a charming smile" is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("Sarah"), a verb ("smiled"), and an object complement ("a charming smile"). The structure of the sentence is simple but clear, making it easy for native speakers to understand. Therefore, I will assign a score of 1 to indicate that the sentence is grammatically correct. As there are no errors related to syntax, semantics, or morphology, I will categorize this response as belonging to the "Other Category."
1	Other Category	The sentence "Sandra beamed a cheerful welcome" is grammatically correct because it follows standard English syntax rules for subject-verb agreement and word order. However, the specific meaning of the sentence may depend on context since "beaming a welcome" could potentially be interpreted as metaphorical or idiomatic. In terms of morphological structure, all words used in the sentence are correctly inflected based on their intended meanings. Therefore, I have labeled this response as belonging to the category "Other Category."
1	Other Category	The sentence "You've really lived it up." is grammatically correct in standard English. It contains a subject ("you"), an auxiliary verb ("have"), a main verb in past participle form ("lived"), an adverb ("really") modifying the verb, and a prepositional phrase ("it up") acting as an adverbial complement, indicating the manner or degree of the action.
0	Syntax	The verb "lift" requires a subject that can perform the action, but in this case, "paperback books" is plural while "onto the table" is singular. A better way to phrase it would be "Paperback books lift easily onto the table." or "One can easily lift paperback books onto the table."
0	Syntax	In present perfect tense, have or has must be followed by a past participle form of the verb. Here, 'lifted' is the past tense instead of past participle form (which would be 'lift'). So it needs to be changed as 'The books have been lifted onto the table'.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Jessica loaded boxes under the wagon." is grammatically correct. In terms of syntax, it follows the rules for word order and structure in English. The subject of the sentence is "Jessica," the verb is "loaded," and the object is "boxes," while "under the wagon" describes where the action took place. Therefore, there are no syntactic errors in this sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Jessica loaded boxes on the wagon" is grammatically correct. In terms of syntax, it follows the standard structure of a simple sentence, having a subject (Jessica), an auxiliary verb (loaded), and an object (boxes) followed by a preposition (on) and its complement (the wagon). All elements are correctly ordered and conjugated, making the sentence syntactically sound.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Jessica crammed boxes at the truck" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "Jessica" is a proper noun and serves as the subject of the sentence. * "crammed" is the verb or predicate of the sentence, indicating past tense action. * "boxes" is the direct object of the sentence, receiving the action of being crammed. * "at the truck" functions as a prepositional phrase modifying where the action took place. Overall, the syntax or arrangement of words in this sentence follows standard English rules for word order and structure.
0	Syntax	The verb "butter" requires a direct object to complete its meaning. In this case, the direct object should be the food being buttered. A more appropriate way to phrase the sentence would be "Lora butterred the toast."
1	Syntax	The sentence "Carla shoveled the walk." is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "Carla" is a proper noun and serves as the subject of the sentence. * "shoveled" is the past tense of the verb "shovel," indicating completed action in the past. It agrees with the subject "Carla" in number (singular) and person (third). * "the walk" is a noun phrase serving as the direct object of the sentence, receiving the action of being shoveled by Carla. Overall, the syntax (word order and grammatical structure) of the sentence follows standard English conventions.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Nora sent the book" is grammatically correct because it follows standard subject-verb-object (SVO) word order in English. The subject "Nora" comes first, followed by the verb "sent," and finally the object "the book." Additionally, each word is correctly formed and inflected for number and tense.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Nora sent Peter the book." is grammatically correct because it follows the basic structure of a simple sentence in English (Subject-Verb-Object). Here, 'Nora' is the subject who performs the action denoted by the verb 'sent'. 'Peter' receives the direct object 'the book', making the entire sentence meaningful without any ambiguity or errors in syntax, morphology, or semantics.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Carla slid the book" is grammatically correct. In terms of syntax, it follows the standard subject-verb-object (SVO) structure found in English. The subject ("Carla") performs the verb ("slid"), and there is a clear object ("the book"). Additionally, the past tense of the verb correctly indicates completed action in relation to time.
0	Syntax	The sentence "Carla slid at the book" is syntactically incorrect because it uses the preposition 'at' instead of a preposition such as 'on' or 'over', which would be more appropriate for describing sliding along or onto a surface such as a book. Additionally, the verb 'slid' implies motion along a surface, but there is no clear indication in the sentence about where Carla ended up after she slid. A possible correction could be "Carla slid on the book," assuming that was what the speaker intended to convey.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Amanda carried the package to Pamela." is grammatically correct. In terms of syntax, it follows the standard structure of a simple sentence (Subject-Verb-Object) where "Amanda" is the subject, "carried" is the verb, and both "the package" and "to Pamela" are objects. No grammatical errors or awkward constructions can be found in this sentence.
0	Syntax	The subject-verb agreement in this sentence is incorrect. In English, singular subjects require a singular verb, while plural subjects require a plural verb. Here, the subject "Packages" is plural, so the verb should be plural as well. A corrected version of the sentence would be: "Packages drive easily to New York." This error can also affect meaning (semantics), since it could lead readers to believe that individual packages have the ability to drive themselves, rather than being transported by drivers or vehicles.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct. In this simple sentence, "the" is a determiner, "chair" is a noun serving as the subject, and "pushed" is the verb in past tense. The syntax follows standard English rules for word order (subject-verb-object), making it clear what action is being performed by whom.
1	Syntax	The sentence "We offered a job to her." is grammatically correct. In this sentence, the subject is "we", the verb is "offered", and the object is "a job". "To" is used here as an infinitive marker introducing the indirect object "her". Therefore, there are no syntax errors or other issues related to morphology, semantics, or any other category.
0	Syntax	The sentence "A job offered" is grammatically incorrect because it lacks a finite verb. In order for the sentence to be complete, it needs a main verb to indicate what is happening or being done. For example, the sentence could be corrected as follows: "A company offers a job." Here, "offers" functions as the finite verb indicating that the subject (a company) is performing an action on the object (a job).
1	Syntax	The sentence "Brown presented a plaque to Jones." is grammatically correct. In terms of syntax, it follows the standard structure of Subject-Verb-Object (SVO), where "Brown" is the subject, "presented" is the verb, and "a plaque" is the object. Additionally, the prepositional phrase "to Jones" modifies the verb by indicating who received the plaque. Overall, there are no syntactic errors or awkward constructions in this sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Carmen bought Mary a dress" is grammatically correct. In terms of syntax (the arrangement of words to create meaningful sentences), the subject of the sentence ("Carmen") is doing the action ("bought"), which is indicated by the verb. Additionally, there is a direct object receiving the action of the verb ("Mary"), as well as an indirect object that explains what was bought for whom ("a dress"). All these components make up a proper simple sentence with a clear structure.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Carmen obtained the spare part at the hardware store" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Carmen," who is performing the action described by the verb "obtained." The direct object is "the spare part," which is being acted upon by the subject. Finally, the prepositional phrase "at the hardware store" tells us where the action took place. In terms of syntax, all of these elements are arranged correctly to form a coherent sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Michelle kept the desk with the papers" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "Michelle" is a proper noun and serves as the subject of the sentence. * "kept" is the verb, indicating past tense and action. * "the desk" is a noun phrase serving as the direct object of the sentence, receiving the action of being kept. * "with the papers" is a prepositional phrase acting as an adjectival phrase modifying "desk," providing additional information about it. Thus, syntactically, all elements fit together correctly, making the sentence acceptable.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject "Frances" is followed by a verb "hid," and then we have a prepositional phrase "in the drawer." Inside this prepositional phrase, there's a determiner "the" along with another noun "drawer." All these elements work together coherently as per English syntax rules.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct because it follows standard subject-verb-object (SVO) word order in English, where the subject ("the needle") comes first, followed by a verb ("poked"), and then the object ("the cloth"). Additionally, each word is used correctly in context and there are no spelling or grammar errors present.
1	Other Category	The sentence "Carrie touched that cat." is grammatically correct. Therefore, I am returning a 1 for this example. This error falls into the category of 'Other' because it does not involve any issues related to syntax (sentence structure), semantics (meaning), or morphology (word formation). Instead, it concerns the input being either right or wrong without further classification.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Herman whipped the sugar and the cream" is grammatically correct. In terms of syntax, it follows the standard structure of a sentence, consisting of a subject ("Herman"), a verb ("whipped"), and two objects ("the sugar" and "the cream") connected by the conjunction "and". Both subjects and verbs agree in number (singular), and there is no misplaced or dangling modifier. Additionally, the word order is appropriate for an active voice construction.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Linda taped the picture to the wall" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * The subject of the sentence is "Linda," a proper noun that refers to a person. Proper nouns always begin with a capital letter. * The verb in the sentence is "taped." This is a past tense verb that indicates that some action has been completed. In this case, the action being referred to is attaching or securing something (the picture) to another thing (the wall). * The direct object of the sentence is "the picture." A direct object is a word or phrase that receives the action of the verb. In this case, the action of taping is being done to the picture. * The preposition in the sentence is "to." A preposition is a word that shows relationships between other words in a sentence. In this case, the preposition "to" is showing the relationship between the picture and the wall. * The object of the preposition is "the wall." An object of the preposition is a word or phrase that follows a preposition and completes its meaning. In this case, the object of the preposition "to" is "the wall," indicating where the picture was attached. Overall, the sentence has a clear structure and all of the elements fit together logically and grammatically. Therefore, it can be classified as syntactically correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Linda taped the picture onto the wall" is grammatically correct. In terms of syntax, it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure (SVO) where "Linda" is the subject, "taped" is the verb, and "the picture onto the wall" serves as the object. Additionally, the prepositional phrase "onto the wall" modifies the action described by the verb, making clear where the taping took place. Overall, there's no glaring error or ambiguity present in the sentence, so I would rate its grammaticality a 1 for being completely accurate from a syntactic standpoint.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct because it follows standard subject-verb-object (SVO) word order ("the child" as the subject, "and" linking another noun phrase "her mother", and "clung" as the verb). Additionally, the pronoun "her" correctly agrees with its antecedent "mother".
1	Syntax	The sentence "This flyer and that flyer differ" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "This flyer" and "that flyer" are both noun phrases functioning as the subject of the sentence. * "Differ" is a verb that takes a plural subject, so it agrees with "this flyer and that flyer." * The coordinating conjunction "and" connects two similar elements ("this flyer" and "that flyer") together to form a compound subject. * Overall, the syntax (word order) and morphological agreement between the subject and the verb are all correct, making this sentence grammatical.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a grammatical error related to syntax. Specifically, there is an incorrect usage of the word "apart." A better way to phrase the sentence would be: "This flyer and that flyer differ in some ways." Alternatively, if the intended meaning was simply to contrast the two flyers, then "This flyer and that flyer are different" or even just "These flyers are different" could work as well.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct. Here's why: * The subject of the sentence is "the jeweler," which is a singular noun that agrees with the third-person singular verb form "scribbled." * The direct object of the sentence is "the contract," which follows the proper order after the verb "scribed." * The prepositional phrase "with his name" modifies the verb "scribbled" by telling us how it was done. Overall, there are no syntax errors or awkward phrasings in this sentence.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct. It follows the standard subject-verb-object (SVO) word order in English. The subject ("the gardener") precedes the verb ("grew"), which in turn precedes the object ("that acorn"). Additionally, there is a clear temporal relationship established between the action of growing and its result (an oak tree), making the semantics coherent as well. No morphological issues are apparent either.
1	Syntax	The sentence "I shaped a loaf" is grammatically correct. The subject "I" is the person who performed the action, the verb "shaped" indicates what action was taken, and the object "a loaf" describes what was acted upon. This follows the basic structure of an English sentence (Subject-Verb-Object), making it syntactically correct.
0	Syntax	In English, a verb must have a subject, and the number (singular or plural) of the subject and the verb must agree. In this case, the subject of the sentence is "the children," which is plural, but the verb "amused" is singular. A corrected version could be "The children were amusing."
1	Syntax	The sentence "Susan whispered the news" is grammatically correct because it follows standard English syntax rules. Here's a breakdown: * Subject: Susan (a noun phrase) * Verb: whispered (a verb) * Direct object: the news (a noun phrase) The subject comes before the verb, and the direct object comes after the verb, following the typical word order for declarative sentences in English (SVO). Therefore, there are no syntactic errors in this sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Susan whispered at Rachel" is grammatically correct. In this sentence, we have a subject ("Susan"), a verb ("whispered") and an object ("Rachel"). This structure follows the rules of English syntax. Additionally, there are no morphological errors (such as incorrect tense or pluralization) and the meaning of the sentence is clear. Therefore, it falls under the category of Syntax, indicating that the structure and arrangement of words in the sentence are correct according to the rules of English grammar.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Ellen said that melons were selling well" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "Ellen" is a proper noun and serves as the subject of the sentence. It is correctly modified by the past tense verb "said." * "That" introduces a subordinate clause, which functions as the direct object of the sentence. Within the subordinate clause, "melons" (the subject) agrees in number with the plural verb form "were selling." * The phrase "well" acts as an adverb modifying the verb "selling," indicating degree or extent. This use of "well" is appropriate since it describes how something is being done rather than evaluating whether something was successful or unsuccessful.
0	Syntax	The sentence "Ellen said about the present conditions" is syntactically incorrect because it lacks a proper object for the preposition "about." A more appropriate way to phrase the sentence could be "Ellen spoke about the current conditions," where "current conditions" serves as the object of the preposition "about."
1	Syntax	The sentence "Ellen warned Helen against skating on thin ice" is grammatically correct because it follows standard English syntax rules for word order and structure. In this sentence, the subject (Ellen) performs the action of warning (warned), the indirect object (Helen) receives the warning, and the prepositional phrase (against skating on thin ice) specifies what the warning is about. This clear and concise sentence effectively communicates its intended meaning without any errors or ambiguities in grammar or syntax.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Cynthia nibbled on the carrot." is grammatically correct. Here's why: * The subject of the sentence is "Cynthia," a proper noun. Proper nouns always begin with a capital letter. * The verb of the sentence is "nibbled," a past tense form of the verb "to nibble" indicating that the action took place in the past. * The object of the sentence is "the carrot," a determiner ("the") followed by a singular countable noun. This construction indicates that there is only one specific carrot being referred to. * The preposition "on" introduces a prepositional phrase modifying the verb "nibbled." It tells us where or what Cynthia was nibbling on. Overall, the syntax (structure) of this sentence is well-formed and follows standard English grammar rules.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Cynthia chewed" is grammatically correct because it follows standard subject-verb agreement rules in English. The subject "Cynthia" is a proper noun and agrees with the verb "chewed," which is in the simple past tense. Additionally, there are no apparent morphological or semantic errors in the sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Paul laughed at Mary" is grammatically correct. In terms of syntax, it has a clear subject ("Paul"), verb ("laughed"), and object ("Mary"). Additionally, the word order follows standard English conventions (subject-verb-object).
0	Syntax	The error in this sentence lies in syntax, or word order and arrangement. In this case, it's unclear what "her lip" refers to after "winked." Generally, we don't wink our lips; instead, we might bite, pout, or lick them. A more appropriate phrase would be something like "Linda bit her lower lip," where both actions make sense together.
0	Syntax	In the sentence "My heart is pounding me," there is a mistake in subject-verb agreement. The verb "is" should agree in number with its subject "heart." However, here it seems as though "me" is being acted upon by the verb instead of "heart," indicating an incorrect use of the reflexive pronoun. A correct version could be "My heart is pounding" or "I am pounding my heart."
1	Syntax	The sentence "Sharon fainted from hunger" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a simple sentence in English (Subject + Verb + Object). In this case, the subject is "Sharon", the verb is "fainted", and there is no explicit object but rather an adverbial phrase "from hunger" indicating the cause or reason for fainting. This construction is syntactically sound as all elements have clear roles and relationships within the sentence.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a simple sentence (Subject-Verb-Object): "The witch" is the subject, "poisoned" is the verb, and "the children" is the object. Additionally, each word is correctly conjugated for tense and number agreement.
1	Syntax	The sentence "A grandfather clock ticked in the hallway" is grammatically correct because it follows standard English syntax rules. It contains a subject ("a grandfather clock"), a verb ("ticked"), and a prepositional phrase ("in the hallway") that modifies the verb. Additionally, the subject-verb agreement is correct as well since "clock" is singular and "ticked" is the past tense form of the verb "to tick," which agrees with the singular subject. Therefore, there are no grammatical errors in this sentence.
0	Syntax	The verb "squeak" typically describes a sound produced by something or someone, rather than an action performed on something else. Therefore, it would be more appropriate to say "The door squeaked" instead of "I squeezed the door." In the corrected version, the subject ("the door") is performing the action described by the verb, following standard English syntax rules for transitive verbs.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Over the fire there bubbled a fragrant stew." is grammatically correct. Here's why: * The subject of the sentence is "a fragrant stew," which is modified by the adjective "fragrant" and follows the verb "bubbled." This structure is syntactically sound because it uses standard word order for simple sentences (Subject-Verb-Object) and correctly employs a past tense verb form. * Additionally, the prepositional phrase "over the fire" describes where the action of bubbling occurred. Prepositions such as "over" can be followed by noun phrases or pronouns; here, "fire" functions as the object of the preposition and agrees with the possessive determiner "the." Overall, the syntax of the sentence is clear and unambiguous.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Soaring temperatures are predicted for this weekend." is grammatically correct. The subject "soaring temperatures" agrees with the verb "are predicted" in number (both singular), making the syntax of the sentence correct. Additionally, the prepositional phrase "for this weekend" correctly modifies the verb, providing further context about when the soaring temperatures will occur. Therefore, there are no errors in syntax, semantics, or morphology, so a label of 1 is appropriate.
1	Other Category	This sentence is grammatically correct but it might be more appropriate to say that the "flags on the fort fluttered" rather than the "fort fluttered with many flags." However, I understand what is meant by the original sentence, so I will still give it a score of 1 for being grammatically correct even if it's slightly awkward or unclear.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the rules for English syntax (sentence structure). It consists of a subject ("the voices") and a predicate ("echoed in the hall"). Additionally, each word within the sentence is used appropriately and agrees with other words in terms of number and tense. Therefore, there are no errors in this sentence related to syntax, semantics, or morphology.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct because it follows standard English syntax rules for word order and structure. The subject ("the stream") comes before the verb ("twists"), and a prepositional phrase ("through the valley") provides additional information about where the action takes place. Additionally, the verb agrees with the singular subject, making the morphological agreement between subject and verb consistent as well.
0	Syntax	The verb "present" should be used as a linking verb in this context, taking a predicate nominative instead of a direct object. Therefore, "there presented himself" should be changed to "he presented himself." Additionally, the adverb "yesterday" would typically come after the verb it modifies (i.e., "He presented himself yesterday"), but since we're changing the subject from impersonal "there" to "he," it makes more sense to place "yesterday" before the verb for clarity. So, the corrected sentence reads: "Yesterday, he presented himself with a wonderful opportunity."
1	Syntax	The sentence "A wonderful opportunity presented itself to him yesterday" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "a wonderful opportunity," which is the noun phrase that the verb "presented" agrees with in number (singular). The time expression "yesterday" gives additional information about when the action took place. In terms of syntax, all elements of the sentence are arranged correctly according to English grammar rules.
0	Syntax	In standard English, we use the past tense form of verbs (e.g., "jumped") to describe actions completed in the past. However, when using helping verbs such as "to be," we need to conjugate them according to their subject's number and person. The original sentence contains the error where the past participle form ("out of the box jumped") was used instead of the simple past tense form ("out of the box jumps" or better yet, "a little white rabbit jumped out of the box"). To make it grammatically correct, I would suggest rewriting the sentence as follows: Corrected Sentence: A little white rabbit jumped out of the box.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Penny skated around the rink" is grammatically correct. In terms of syntax, it follows the standard subject-verb-object (SVO) structure where "Penny" is the subject, "skated" is the verb, and "around the rink" serves as the object of the preposition "around." This forms a complete thought with no grammatical errors or awkward constructions.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Jackie accompanied Rose" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules for syntax (word order) in English. In a simple sentence consisting of a subject ("Jackie") and a verb ("accompanied"), the word order typically goes as follows: Subject + Verb + Object (SVO). Here, the subject "Jackie" performs the action denoted by the verb "accompanied," while "Rose" serves as the object being accompanied. Therefore, there is no error related to syntax in this sentence.
0	Syntax	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in this sentence. In English, a singular subject requires a singular verb, while a plural subject requires a plural verb. Here, the subject "many information" is plural but the verb "was" is singular. A correct version would be "Much information was provided" or "Many pieces of information were provided."
0	Syntax	The noun "advice" is uncountable, so it should be used with a singular verb. Therefore, the correct form of the sentence would be "John offers **a lot of** advice."
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct. It contains a complex noun phrase ("the cake that Jones got") modified by a relative clause ("that Jones got"). The comparative structure "more delicious than" is used correctly to compare two cakes. Additionally, the verb tense is consistent throughout the sentence (simple past).
0	Syntax	The correct form of the verb to be after "recommend" when talking about something general (as opposed to a specific action happening now) is the base form of the verb, so it should be "recommends." Additionally, there should be a comma before the conjunction "and" since both clauses can stand alone as separate sentences ("We recommend eating less cake," and "Pastry should be eaten sparingly"). A corrected version would read: "We recommend eating less cake and pastry."
1	Syntax	The sentence “I saw that gas can explode” is grammatically correct. In this sentence, “saw” functions as a verb indicating past tense, “that” serves as a conjunction connecting two clauses together, “gas” acts as the subject of the second clause, and “can explode” represents the predicate (verb phrase) for the subject “gas”. Overall, the syntax or arrangement of words follows standard English rules.
1	Syntax	The sentence "He washed her" is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple sentence structure, where the subject "he" performs the action "washed," which is the verb, on the object "her." Both subjects and objects are nouns or pronouns, while verbs indicate actions taken by those nouns or pronouns. In this case, there's no error in syntax as all components of the sentence fit their respective roles correctly.
0	Syntax	The verb "wash" requires a direct object to complete its meaning. In this case, the subject ("you") needs to be followed by a direct object to form a grammatically correct sentence. A possible correction could be "Wash **you**r hands!" or "I will wash **the car**."
0	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically incorrect because it lacks a complete thought or predicate. The phrase "no in" does not form a meaningful predicate for the subject "they." In order for a sentence to be grammatical, it must contain both a subject and a predicate. Additionally, there seems to be a missing word such as "idea," "clue," or something similar before "in." A possible correction could be "They have no idea where to go next."
0	Syntax	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in this sentence. In English, a singular subject requires a singular verb, while a plural subject requires a plural verb. Here, the subject "some" is acting as a determiner for the noun "jobs," so it is considered part of the plural noun phrase "some jobs." Therefore, the correct form of the verb would be "are" instead of "is": "Some of my jobs are in jeopardy."
0	Syntax	The clause "it was the policeman met" contains incorrect subject-verb agreement and word order. A more grammatically correct version would be "The policeman met several young students in the park last night," or alternatively, for a passive construction, "Several young students were met by the policeman in the park last night."
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a mistake in subject-verb agreement. In the present tense, we add -s or -es to verbs when the subject is he, she, it, or a singular noun (e.g., the policeman). Therefore, the verb "did" should be replaced by "does": "Does the policeman meet in the park?" This error falls under syntax as it involves incorrect word order or arrangement of words in a sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence "John put old books in the box" is grammatically correct. In terms of syntax (the arrangement of words to create meaningful sentences), all elements have been placed correctly. We have a subject ("John"), a verb ("put") and two objects ("old books", "the box"). Additionally, we can see that there is a clear relationship between these components through proper word order and structure.
0	Syntax	In this sentence, there is a subject ("the monkeys") but no main verb indicating what the subject is doing or being. A complete clause requires both a subject and a predicate (a verb). Therefore, the corrected version of the sentence could be "The monkeys are proud of their leader."
0	Syntax	The sentence "John sounded very." is grammatically incorrect because it lacks a necessary complement to the adverb "very". In order for the sentence to be complete and grammatical, a complement such as an adjective or noun phrase would need to follow "very" (e.g., "John sounded very tired.", "John sounded very loud."). Without this additional information, the sentence remains incomplete and unclear in meaning.
0	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically incorrect because it lacks a main verb. A complete sentence requires both a subject and a predicate (a verb). In this case, there is only a subject ("I") but no predicate. To fix the error, you could add a suitable verb, such as "know" or "should," after "I." For example, you could say "I don't know if I should agree" or "I don't know whether I agree." Both of these revised versions have a clear subject ("I") and a predicate ("don't know" or "agree"), making them grammatically correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "John bought a book on the table" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules for English syntax. In particular, the subject ("John") comes before the verb ("bought"), and the object ("a book") comes after the verb. Additionally, there is a prepositional phrase ("on the table") modifying the object, which shows where the action took place. All these elements combine to form a well-formed sentence that conveys a clear meaning.
1	Syntax	The sentence "John called the president a fool" is grammatically correct because it follows standard English syntax rules for subject-verb-object (SVO) word order. The subject ("John") comes first, followed by the verb ("called"), and then the object ("the president"). Additionally, the adjective ("fool") correctly modifies "president." No grammatical errors can be found in this sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence “I forgot how good beer tastes.” is grammatically correct. Here’s why: * The subject-verb agreement is correct (the singular subject “I” matches with the verb “forgot”). * The word order follows standard English syntax rules (Subject-Verb-Object; SVO), where “I” is the subject, “forgot” is the verb, and the phrase “how good beer tastes” serves as the object of the sentence. * In addition, the embedded question structure (“how + adjective + noun”) within the larger declarative sentence is acceptable in informal contexts.
1	Other Category	The sentence "This teacher is a genius" is grammatically correct because it follows standard English syntax rules for word order (subject-verb-object) and uses appropriate morphological forms for subject-verb agreement ("teacher" is singular and "is" is the third person present tense form of the verb "to be"). Additionally, there are no semantic errors or other issues with the sentence. Therefore, I have returned a score of 1 indicating that the sentence is grammatically correct.
0	Syntax	The verb tense used in this sentence is incorrect. In standard English, we would say "A good friend remains to me by him," but even then, it does not make much sense. It seems as if there was a misunderstanding about who possesses or owns the friendship, whether it's "me" or "him." Instead, I suggest rephrasing the entire sentence for clarity. For example: He has remained a good friend to me.
1	Other Category	The sentence "John ate his noodle quietly" is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple sentence structure with a subject ("John"), verb ("ate"), direct object ("noodle"), and adverb ("quietly"). The morphological forms of the words are appropriate for their intended meanings, and there are no semantic errors or ambiguities present. Therefore, it falls under the category of "Other".
1	Syntax	The sentence "A smith hammered the metal" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object (SVO) word order in English. Here, "a smith" is the subject, "hammered" is the verb, and "the metal" is the object. Additionally, all words are used appropriately based on their morphological forms, and there is no semantic ambiguity or error in the sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Sandy removed her ballet shoes" is grammatically correct. In terms of syntax, it follows the standard subject-verb-object (SVO) word order in English. Additionally, the verb "removed" agrees with its plural subject "she," as indicated by the possessive determiner "her." Furthermore, there are no missing or extra words, and all parts of speech appear in their proper function within the sentence. Therefore, I would rate this sentence as syntactically correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "This week will be a difficult one for us." is grammatically correct. The subject "this week" is followed by the appropriate verb tense "will be," indicating future time. The adjective "difficult" correctly modifies the noun phrase "one for us." Therefore, there are no syntax errors in this sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Benny worked in a shoe factory when he was a student" is grammatically correct. It follows standard English syntax rules for word order and structure. Here's how it breaks down: * Benny (subject) + worked (verb) - in (preposition) --- a shoe factory (object of preposition) ---- where (subordinating conjunction introducing a dependent clause) ------ he was (subject of dependent clause) ------- a student (predicate nominative). The sentence has a clear subject ("Benny") and predicate ("worked"), and uses appropriate punctuation to separate clauses. Therefore, there are no errors in syntax or other grammatical components.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Everyone hoped that she would sing" is grammatically correct. In terms of syntax (the arrangement of words to create meaningful sentences), all elements of this sentence follow standard English rules. We have a subject ("everyone"), followed by a verb ("hoped") and an adverbial clause ("that she would sing"). Each word has been used correctly and contributes to the overall meaning of the sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence "This proved a decisive factor" is grammatically correct. It follows standard subject-verb-object word order (SVO), where "this" serves as the subject, "proved" functions as the verb, and "a decisive factor" acts as the object. Additionally, there are no apparent morphological or semantic errors within the sentence, making it syntactically sound.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object (SVO) word order in English and all words are used in their appropriate forms according to their grammatical function. In this case, the subject ("the crocodile") comes before the verb ("devoured"), and the object ("the doughnut") comes after the verb. Additionally, there are no spelling or punctuation errors in this sentence.
1	Other Category	The sentence "John is afraid of Bill" is grammatically correct. Therefore, I am returning a 1 for the label. Since there are no errors related to syntax, semantics, or morphology, the category will be set as 'Other Category'.
0	Syntax	The sentence "John put under the bathtub" is syntactically incorrect because it lacks a prepositional phrase or a clause indicating what John put under the bathtub. A possible correction could be "John put the soap under the bathtub."
1	Syntax	The sentence "John placed Kim behind the garage" is grammatically correct. In terms of syntax, it has a clear subject ("John"), verb ("placed") and object ("Kim"). Additionally, the prepositional phrase "behind the garage" correctly modifies the action described by the verb.
0	Syntax	The sentence "Kim depends for Sandy" is grammatically incorrect because it lacks a proper verb to connect the two nouns (Kim and Sandy). A more appropriate way to phrase this would be "Kim depends on Sandy," where "on" serves as the preposition linking "depends" and "Sandy."
1	Syntax	The sentence "John put the book in the box" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "John", the verb is "put", and the objects are "the book" and "the box". The word order follows standard English syntax rules for a simple sentence. Additionally, there are no morphological or semantic errors in the sentence.
1	Syntactically Correct	The sentence "John taught English Syntax to new students" is grammatically correct from a syntactic perspective as it follows standard English syntax rules for word order and structure. It has a clear subject ("John"), verb ("taught") and object ("English Syntax") along with a prepositional phrase providing additional information about who was being taught ("to new students"). All words are used correctly, there are no spelling errors or missing punctuation marks, making it a well-formed English sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence "John regards Bill as a good friend" is grammatically correct. In terms of syntax (the arrangement of words to create meaningful sentences), all elements have been included and ordered correctly. We can see that there is a subject ("John"), verb ("regards") and object ("Bill"). Additionally, we have a prepositional phrase ("as a good friend") starting with "as", acting as an adverbial of reason or manner. Overall, no errors exist in this sentence regarding its structure or order of components.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Kim put in the box" is grammatically correct according to standard English syntax rules. It contains a subject ("Kim"), a verb ("put"), and an object ("the box"). Additionally, there is a preposition phrase headed by "in," which modifies the verb "put." This structure indicates that someone (Kim) placed something (not specified) into a container (the box). Therefore, it does not contain any errors related to morphological, syntactic or semantic issues.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject ("the chickens") agrees with the verb tense ("seem"), and there is a clear relationship between the subjects and their corresponding verbs. Additionally, the prepositional phrase "of the farmer" provides more information about what the chickens are fond of.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "the rules," and it requires a linking verb ("be") to connect it to the predicate adjective phrase "polite." Since the plural noun "executives" follows the required preposition "of," there is no syntax error in this sentence.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a syntactic error because the word "nominated" has been placed incorrectly within the sentence. In order for the sentence to be grammatically correct, it must read as follows: "That Fred nominated Bill was unpopular." Alternatively, if the intended meaning is that Fred's nomination of Bill made him unpopular, then the sentence could be restructured as: "Fred's nominating Bill made him unpopular." The original sentence is problematic because it suggests that someone or something called "that Fred was unpopular" did the nominating, which does not make logical sense.
1	Syntax	The sentence "They were taking a hard look at possible FTA" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "They" is a plural subject pronoun. * "were taking" indicates past continuous tense, indicating ongoing action in the past. * "a hard look" functions as an adverbial phrase modifying the verb "taking," meaning they examined something carefully. * "at" is a preposition introducing the prepositional phrase "at possible FTA." * "possible FTA" stands for "Possible Foreign Trade Agreements," serving as the object of the preposition "at." Therefore, there are no syntax errors in this sentence.
0	Semantics	The sentence "John paid me against the book" is semantically incorrect because it's unclear what "against the book" means in this context. It could be interpreted as paying someone while holding a book or using a book as collateral for payment, but neither interpretation makes much sense without additional context. Additionally, if the intended meaning was to pay for the book, the preposition "for" would typically be used instead of "against."
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject ("the committee") is followed by a verb ("will study"), and then there is an object ("the feasibility of setting up a national computer network"). The tense of the verbs is consistent, and all words are used appropriately according to their part of speech. Additionally, the sentence conveys a clear meaning (semantics), and it does not contain any errors related to word formation or inflection (morphology).
0	Syntax	The sentence "We made them be rude" is syntactically incorrect because it uses the verb "made" with the wrong form of the verb "to be". A more grammatically correct way to phrase the idea would be "We made them act rudely." or "We caused them to be rude.", where "acted" and "be" both agree with their subject "them" in number (third person plural) and tense (past).
1	Syntax	The sentence "After reading the pamphlet, Judy threw it into the garbage can." is grammatically correct. The phrase "after reading the pamphlet" is a dependent clause that describes when the action took place, while "Judy threw it into the garbage can" is an independent clause that contains the main verb and subject. Together they form a complete thought or sentence. Additionally, all words are spelled correctly and there are no errors in word formation (morphology) or meaning (semantics).
0	Syntax	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in this sentence. The plural noun "students" does not agree with the singular verb form "reads." It should be changed to "read," so the corrected version would read as follows: "Students studying English read Conrad's Heart of Darkness while at university."
1	Syntax	The sentence "I read some of the book." is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "I" is a proper noun functioning as the subject of the sentence. * "read" is a verb in the past tense indicating the action performed by the subject. * "some" is a determiner modifying the noun phrase "of the book". * "of the book" is a prepositional phrase acting as an adverbial complement specifying which part of the book was read. * Overall, the syntax follows standard English rules for word order and structure.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Most of the fruit is rotten" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "most of the fruit," which is a determiner phrase acting as the subject. The verb "is" agrees with the plural noun "fruit." Additionally, there is no semantic or morphological issue present in the sentence.
0	Semantics	The sentence "Neither of students failed" is grammatically incorrect due to a semantic error. In this case, the phrase "neither of" requires a plural noun or pronoun immediately following it (e.g., "Neither of the students failed"). However, there is no article ("the") before "students," making the sentence unclear about whom it refers to. To make the sentence clearer and more accurate, we could rephrase it as follows: "Neither student failed."
0	Syntax	The error in this sentence lies within its syntax structure, specifically in the use of the article "some" before a singular countable noun "water". In standard English usage, we would say "some water" or "a little water", but never "*some water" (with asterisk indicating ungrammaticality). Therefore, my response will be 0 for incorrectness based on syntactic grounds.
0	Syntax	The noun phrase "a gold hair" is incorrect because the adjective "golden," rather than "gold," must be used to describe hair color. Therefore, the corrected form would be "a golden hair."
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct because it follows standard English syntax rules for word order and structure. The subject ("the boy") comes before the verb ("waved"), and there is a clear relationship between the different parts of the sentence established through prepositions ("in", "to"). Additionally, the verb tense is consistent throughout the sentence, making the meaning easy to understand.
1	Syntax	The sentence "That dog is so ferocious, it even tried to bite itself." is grammatically correct. The subject-verb agreement is maintained throughout the sentence as 'that dog' (plural in meaning but singular in form) agrees with its verb 'is'. Furthermore, the reflexive pronoun 'itself' correctly refers back to the antecedent 'it', indicating that the dog bit itself.
0	Syntax	The verb "wash" requires an object pronoun (me, you, him, her, it, us, them) instead of a reflexive pronoun (myself, yourself, himself, herself, itself, ourselves, themselves). Therefore, the grammatically correct form would be "He washed you." or "He washed himself," depending on who was being washed.
0	Syntax	The sentence "John is easy to please Kim" is syntactically incorrect because there is no preposition or conjunction linking "easy to please" and "Kim". A correct version could be "John is easy to please *because of* Kim" or "John is easy to please, not *unlike* Kim."
0	Syntax	The sentence "There seemed to be intelligent" is grammatically incorrect because it lacks a noun or pronoun after the verb "be." A more complete version of the sentence could be "There seemed to be intelligent life," assuming we're talking about extraterrestrial beings. Alternatively, if we want to talk about someone being smart, a possible correction would be "He seemed to be intelligent."
1	Other Category	The sentence "John tried to please Stephen" is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple tense verb phrase ("tried") followed by an infinitive clause ("to please Stephen"). Both syntax (word order) and morphology (inflectional endings on verbs) are correct. Semantically, the sentence makes sense as it conveys a clear meaning about John's attempt to please Stephen. Therefore, there are no errors in this sentence.
0	Semantics	The sentence "We believed John to be a fountain in the park" is semantically incorrect because people cannot be transformed into inanimate objects such as fountains. Additionally, it is illogical for a person to be located in a specific place within a park when no context has been provided regarding their presence there.
0	Syntax	The subject ("it") does not agree with its verb ("tries"). In present tense third person singular contexts (i.e., when referring to a single entity), verbs must end in -s or -es. Thus, it should be "try" instead of "tries". So, the corrected sentence would read as follows: "It try to leave the country." However, since we want to maintain proper agreement between the subject and the verb, I will assume that there was a typo, and change "tries" into "try", resulting in a grammatically correct sentence.
1	Other Category	The sentence "John tries to leave the country." is grammatically correct. It consists of a noun phrase ("John") followed by a verb phrase ("tries to leave the country"). The verb phrase contains an auxiliary verb ("tries"), a main verb ("leave"), and an object ("the country"). All words are used correctly, and there are no grammatical errors or awkward constructions. Therefore, I would rate this sentence as 1 (correct).
1	Syntax	The sentence "Under the bed seems to be a fun place to hide" is grammatically correct. The prepositional phrase "under the bed" functions as an adverbial modifying where the action (seeming) takes place. The verb tense agrees between "seems" and "to be." Overall, there are no syntax errors or other issues affecting the grammaticality of this sentence.
0	Syntax	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in this sentence. The verb "is" should agree in number with its subject "there," but instead it agrees with the noun that follows, "sheep." A plural subject requires a plural verb, so the correct form would be "There are believed to be sheep in the park."
0	Syntax	The verb tense used in the sentence is incorrect. Instead of using "would" after "hope," it should be a simple present tense such as "I hope to study in France." Alternatively, if the speaker wants to indicate future intention, they could say "I hope to will study in France," although this usage can sound overly formal or stilted.
1	Syntax	The sentence "John can kick the ball" is grammatically correct. In terms of syntax, it follows the standard structure of a simple sentence, consisting of a subject ("John") and a predicate ("can kick the ball"). Additionally, each word within the sentence has been used correctly and functions appropriately within its context (e.g., "can" indicates ability, rather than a question or request). Therefore, there are no errors in this sentence related to syntax, semantics, morphology, or any other category.
0	Syntax	In English, we don't use the verb 'rain' in the active voice; it is always used in the intransitive form without a subject (i.e., as an impersonal verb). Therefore, the sentence "John will rain tomorrow" is grammatically incorrect since 'rain' cannot be used with a personal pronoun such as 'he', 'she', or 'John'. The proper way to express future rain would be: "It will rain tomorrow."
0	Syntax	The error in this sentence is related to subject-auxiliary agreement in verb tense. In the present tense, we use "will" as a helper verb for future tense predictions, but it's incorrect to combine "there" (the subject) with two auxiliaries ("expect" and "will"). Instead, say "It is going to rain." or "We expect it to rain."
1	Syntax	The sentence "John was found in the office" is grammatically correct. In terms of syntax, it follows a standard subject-verb-object structure (SVO) where "John" is the subject, "was found" is the verb phrase, and "in the office" serves as a prepositional phrase specifying location. No grammatical errors can be identified here.
0	Syntax	The verb tense is incorrect in this sentence. In English, we use the auxiliary verb "did" for past tense questions, but it should be followed by the base form of the main verb (in this case, "be" should be "was" or "were"). A correct version could be "Did the child **was** in the school?" However, a more natural way to ask this question would be "Was the child in the school?" or simply "Was the child at school?"
1	Syntax	The sentence "It did not rain" is grammatically correct. In negative statements, we use auxiliary verb (do/does/did) before not. Here, 'did' is used as an auxiliary verb before 'not'. Also, the past tense form 'rain' follows the auxiliary verb correctly. Hence, it is a syntactically correct sentence.
0	Syntax	The sentence "John wants not to leave the town" contains a double negative ("not" modifying "to leave"), which can lead to confusion about what John actually wants. It would be better to rephrase it as "John wants to stay in the town," or if maintaining a negative form is necessary for context, "John does not want to leave the town."
1	Syntax	The sentence "Mary likes to tour art galleries, but Bill hates to." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of English syntax. It has a subject ("Mary" and "Bill"), verb ("likes" and "hates"), and object ("to tour art galleries"). Additionally, the coordinating conjunction "but" connects two independent clauses, making the sentence complete.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a double negative ("needn't" + "not"), which creates confusion and makes it grammatically incorrect. A correct version would be "They need not take this exam." or simply "They don't have to take this exam."
1	Syntax	The sentence "Ann may spend her vacation in Italy" is grammatically correct. In terms of syntax, it has a clear subject ("Ann"), modal verb ("may"), main verb ("spend"), object ("her vacation"), preposition ("in"), and location complement ("Italy"). All these components form a coherent structure following the rules of Standard English grammar.
1	Syntax	The sentence “They love to play golf, but I do not” is grammatically correct. The subject-verb agreement is maintained throughout the sentence (they love vs. I do not), and the coordinating conjunction but connects two independent clauses effectively. Additionally, there is a comma splice after the first clause, ensuring proper separation between the thoughts expressed within each clause. Overall, no syntax errors can be identified in this sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence "George has spent a lot of money, hasn't he?" is grammatically correct. It consists of an independent clause "George has spent a lot of money" followed by a tag question "hasn't he", which is used to seek confirmation or agreement from the listener about the statement made in the independent clause. The subject-auxiliary inversion in the tag question ("hasn't he") indicates its function as a question. Overall, the syntax of the sentence is well-formed and appropriate for conveying the intended meaning.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains an error in subject-verb agreement. In the clause "scarcely could he do anything," the singular verb form "could" does not agree with its plural subject "he." This type of construction usually requires a plural verb such as "could do." A possible correction would be: "Scarcely could he do anything worth mentioning." Alternatively, if we want to emphasize the idea that there was little he could do, we might say something like: "Little could he do worth mentioning."
1	Syntax	The sentence "We never found any of the unicorns" is grammatically correct. It follows standard subject-verb agreement rules (the plural subject "unicorns" matches with the plural verb "found"). Additionally, the article "the" before "unicorns" indicates a specific group of unicorns being referred to, making the sentence clear and easy to understand.
1	Other Category	The sentence "One of Korea's most famous poets wrote these lines." is grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("one of Korea's most famous poets"), a verb ("wrote"), and an object ("these lines"). Additionally, it uses possessive form correctly by adding an apostrophe after "Korea's". Therefore, there are no errors related to syntax, semantics or morphology.
1	Syntax	The sentence appears grammatically correct. The subject ("somebody") is followed by a verb ("struck"), and then there's an object ("the unidentified victim"). The time frame for the action is provided as well ("during the early morning hours"). Overall, no grammatical or syntactical errors can be identified in this sentence.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct because it follows standard subject-verb-object (SVO) word order in English. Additionally, the past tense verb "was driven" agrees with its singular subject "the car." No syntax errors are present.
1	Other Category	The sentence "Ricky can be relied on" is grammatically correct. Here's a breakdown of why it is correct: * "Ricky" is a proper noun functioning as the subject of the sentence. * "can be relied on" is a verb phrase consisting of an auxiliary verb "can," followed by the past participle form of the verb "rely." This construction expresses the ability or potential for someone (in this case, Ricky) to perform a certain action (be reliable). The sentence is semantically coherent, conveying a positive message about Ricky's trustworthiness. Overall, there are no errors in syntax, morphology, or meaning in this sentence, so we assign it a score of 1.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "The bed" is a noun phrase serving as the subject of the sentence. It contains the definite article "the," which specifies a particular bed, and the plural noun "bed." * "was slept in" is a verb phrase functioning as the predicate. It consists of an auxiliary (or helping) verb "was" and the past participle form of the verb "sleep," "slept." Together they form the passive voice. In active voice, it would be "Someone slept in the bed." However, the passive voice works perfectly fine here since we can infer from context who or what might have slept there.
0	Syntax	The sentence "A pound was weighed by the book" contains a mistake in its syntax, specifically word order. In passive voice constructions such as this one, the verb's past participle ("weighed") must be followed immediately by the agent performing the action (in this case, "the book"). However, it should instead read "The book weighed a pound." Here, "a pound" functions as the direct object, receiving the action of being weighed.
1	Semantics	The sentence "Who do you think Tom saw?" is grammatically correct. It follows the standard structure for a question in English, including subject-auxiliary inversion ("do" + auxiliary verb) and the use of the appropriate tense (present). Additionally, it includes a pronoun ("who") acting as the subject of the embedded clause ("Tom saw who"), which modifies the main clause ("you think"). This type of construction is common when asking questions about indirect speech or thoughts. Therefore, no corrections need to be made to this sentence based on syntax, morphology, semantics, or other grammatical categories.
1	Syntax	The sentence "he had spent five thousand dollars" is grammatically correct. In terms of syntax, it has a clear subject ("he"), verb tense that indicates past action ("had spent") and an object ("five thousand dollars"). Therefore, there are no syntactic errors in this sentence.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a syntactic error because it lacks a proper subject-verb agreement. Specifically, there is no clear antecedent for the pronoun 'her'. Also, the verb 'to vote' needs an auxiliary verb (e.g., 'should') or another form such as 'votes' if we refer to Fed as singular. Here is a possible correction: Corrected version: "Fed knows which politician she should vote for."
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a question mark at the end, indicating it is intended as a question, but does not follow the typical syntax for forming questions in English. In interrogative sentences in English, auxiliary or modal verbs (e.g., do, does, will) typically come before the subject when asking about past events. Therefore, the correct way to phrase this question would be: "How did you fix the computer?"
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct. It contains a relative clause ("whose efforts to achieve peace") modifying the noun phrase "the world should honor." The verb "knows" agrees with its subject "committee," and both singular. The word order follows standard English rules for declarative sentences (Subject-Verb-Object). All words are used appropriately according to their part of speech, and there are no missing or extra elements.
0	Syntax	The sentence is missing a question mark at the end, making it syntactically incorrect. Additionally, there should be an apostrophe after "friend" to indicate possession (i.e., "your friend's"). Therefore, the corrected sentence would be: "Which house does your friend’s live?" However, I suspect that what was intended was a plural form for "friend," so the grammatically correct version would actually be: "Which houses do your friends live in?" Given the ambiguity of the original prompt, though, my response will focus on its syntax errors rather than attempting to infer the speaker's intended meaning.
1	Syntax	The sentence "the baker from whom I bought these bagels left" is grammatically correct. It uses a relative clause ("from whom I bought these bagels") to provide additional information about the noun phrase ("the baker"). This type of construction is often used in formal or written English. While some people may prefer to use a simpler phrasing (e.g., "the baker who sold me these bagels left"), there is nothing inherently incorrect about using a more complex structure like this one.
1	Other Category	The sentence “I found the place where we can relax” is grammatically correct. It contains a subject (“I”), a verb (“found”), and a direct object (“the place where we can relax”). The phrase “where we can relax” functions as an adjective clause modifying “place.” This sentence falls under other category because it does not contain any errors related to syntax, semantics or morphology.
0	Syntax	The phrase "with whom" implies a relative pronoun for the object of the clause, but there is no verb associated with it. A corrected version could be "Jack is the person with whom Jenny fell in love." or simply "Jack is the person Jenny fell in love with."
1	Other Category	The sentence “There is a bench to sit on” is grammatically correct. However, it could be improved for clarity by saying “There is a bench where one can sit.” Nonetheless, I will mark it as grammatically correct because no errors exist based on conventional rules.
1	Syntax	The sentence "I met the man who grows peaches" is grammatically correct. In terms of syntax, it follows the standard structure of a simple sentence, consisting of a subject ("I"), a verb ("met"), and an adjectival clause ("who grows peaches") modifying the noun phrase "the man." Additionally, each word is correctly inflected for its role in the sentence (e.g., "meets" would be incorrect as the past tense of "meet"). Therefore, there are no syntactic errors in this sentence.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a pronoun error known as a missing antecedent. In this case, "his" does not have a clear referent earlier in the sentence or discourse. A corrected version might be: "Which topic did you choose without getting Joe's approval?" or "Without getting approval, which topic did you choose?"
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a pronoun "which" without a clear antecedent (the word it refers back to). In order for this sentence to be grammatically correct, we would need to know what specific topic Mary was discussing that the speaker got bored of. For example, the corrected sentence could read: "Which topic about gardening did you get bored because Mary talked about?" This way, the pronoun "which" has a clear antecedent ("topic") and the sentence makes sense.
1	Other Category	The sentence “That is the reason why he resigned” is grammatically correct. It has a clear subject (“that”), verb (“is”), and object (“the reason why he resigned”). Additionally, it follows standard syntactic rules for word order and structure, making it understandable and coherent. Therefore, there are no issues related to syntax, semantics, or morphology in this sentence.
1	Other Category	The sentence "It bothers me that John coughs" is grammatically correct. Therefore, I am returning a 1 for this example. This falls into the "Other Category" because there are no issues related to syntax, semantics, or morphology. The sentence expresses a clear meaning where the speaker gets annoyed due to John's continuous coughing.
1	Syntax	The sentence "To please John is easy" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "to please" is an infinitive verb phrase acting as the subject complement of the linking verb "is." * "John" is a noun serving as the direct object of the infinitive verb "please." * "easy" is an adjective functioning as the predicate adjective describing the degree of difficulty involved in pleasing John. Therefore, there are no syntax errors in this sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Kim is eager to please Tom" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Kim," who is described as being "eager to please Tom." This is a simple declarative sentence with proper syntax, including a noun phrase ("Kim"), an auxiliary verb ("is"), an adjective ("eager"), an infinitive verb phrase ("to please"), and another noun phrase ("Tom").
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a subject-verb agreement error. The plural noun "we" does not agree with the singular verb form "bites." It should be "that we invaded Iraq really bites." instead of "that we invaded Iraq really bites." In order for the sentence to be grammatically correct, it should read: "That we invaded Iraq really bites."
1	Syntax	The sentence "It annoys me that Fido barks" is grammatically correct. Here's a breakdown of its syntax: * "It" serves as the subject of the sentence. * "annoys" functions as the verb (a linking verb), connecting the subject ("it") to the predicate adjective phrase "me." * "me" is the direct object of the verb "annoy," indicating who or what is being annoyed. * "that" introduces a subordinate clause ("Fido barks"). * "Fido" is the subject of the subordinate clause. * "barks" is the verb in the subordinate clause. Overall, the sentence has proper structure and follows standard English grammar rules.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a misplaced modifier. In the original sentence, it may seem as though achieving the best result itself was what or who belonged to Angela, when actually the intended meaning is that Angela herself was the one who achieved the best result. To fix the error, we can simply switch the positions of "Angela" and "was": "Angela achieved the best result."
1	Syntax	The sentence "It was the peasant girl who got it" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "it," which is a dummy pronoun used here as a placeholder for the real subject, which is expressed later in the clause by "the peasant girl." This construction is called a cleft sentence, where a single element from a larger sentence is emphasized. Here, the emphasis is on "the peasant girl" being the one who performed the action. In terms of syntax, the sentence has a clear structure, consisting of a noun phrase ("it"), followed by a linking verb ("was"), another noun phrase ("the peasant girl") serving as the subject complement, and a tensed verb phrase ("who got it"). All these elements fit together well in their respective roles, making the sentence syntactically sound.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a grammatical error related to subject-verb agreement. The phrase "that kind of person" is singular, so the verb should be singular as well. Therefore, instead of saying "anyone to look after," it should say "anyone to look after." Here's the corrected version of the sentence: Corrected Sentence: That kind of person is hard to find anyone who can look after them.
1	Semantics	The sentence "A sick owl doesn't hunt mice" is grammatically correct and conveys a clear meaning. It indicates that a particular owl who is feeling unwell does not engage in hunting mice. Therefore, there are no errors related to syntax, morphology or other categories present in this sentence.
0	Semantics	The sentence contains a quantifier error. "Each" implies that every individual must meet the condition for admission, whereas "who has interest in semantics" implies only some individuals may have such an interest. To fix it, consider revising as follows: "Only candidates who demonstrate an interest in semantics will be admitted to the department."
0	Syntax	The sentence "Each author whose contribution is wrote in any language other than English" contains a syntax error. Specifically, the verb "wrote" does not agree with its subject "author." Since there can be multiple authors, the plural form of the verb must be used, resulting in "Each author whose contributions are written..." This correction ensures number agreement between the subject and verb.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a subject-verb agreement error. The verb "got" does not agree with its plural subject "we." It should be changed to "have gotten" or simply "gotten" for past participle usage. A contraction can also be used as "We've gotten these tickets!"
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a double negative ("even" and "got"), which can result in a positive meaning but sounds unnatural in standard English. Revising it to something like "I'm sure we have these tickets!" would resolve the issue and make the sentence grammatically correct while preserving its intended meaning.
1	Semantics	The sentence is grammatically correct. In terms of semantics, it means that the speaker does not assist the person (who is possibly a member of an urban guerrilla group) due to having sympathetic feelings towards them but rather for some other reason. Therefore, there is no mistake in this sentence related to syntax, morphology or another category.
1	Syntax	The sentence "It isn't because Sue said anything bad about me that I'm angry" is grammatically correct. The clause "because Sue said anything bad about me" provides a reason for the speaker being angry but does not cause it directly. This type of construction is called a concessive clause and it is used to express something that might be expected to have an effect but doesn't. In this case, the fact that Sue said something bad about the speaker did not make the speaker angry, so a concessive clause is appropriate.
1	Syntax	The sentence "That he was hungry, John whined" is grammatically correct. It contains two independent clauses: "that he was hungry" and "John whined." These clauses are connected by a comma, which is a common way to link two related ideas in a single sentence. This construction is called a compound sentence. In this case, the first clause provides additional information about why "John whined," so it functions as a subordinate clause. Both clauses contain subjects ("he" and "John") and verbs ("was" and "whined"), making them complete thoughts that can stand alone as separate sentences if necessary. Overall, the syntax of this sentence is complex but entirely proper.
0	Syntax	The sentence "1 gave Mary after the party a book." is syntactically incorrect because it violates the rule for word order in English sentences. In English, the basic word order is subject-verb-object (SVO). However, in this sentence, there seems to be some confusion regarding the placement of "after the party" and "a book". A possible correction could be "I gave Mary a book after the party."
0	Syntax	The phrase "as for" is used incorrectly in this context. This construction can be used to introduce a new topic or change to a different subject, but it does not make sense following "I really like her." A more appropriate way to express this idea would be: "Because she's so pleasant, I really like her, Mary in particular."
1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically correct. It has a clear subject ("he"), verb ("hate") and object ("those that criticize Carter"). Additionally, there is a subordinate clause ("it doesn't matter") which provides additional information but does not affect the grammaticality of the main clause. Overall, the sentence follows standard English syntax rules and is therefore grammatically correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a syntactic error known as subject-verb agreement. In the present tense, singular subjects require a singular verb form, while plural subjects require a plural verb form. Here, the subject "no job" requires a singular verb because it represents a single entity. However, the verb "would" does not agree in number with its subject; instead, we need the third person singular form "would have." Thus, a corrected version could read: "With no job, John wouldn't be happy."
0	Syntax	The error in this sentence is related to subject-verb agreement. In this case, "much" is a determiner that requires a singular verb. Therefore, the correct form of the verb to use here is "has," not "have." So the corrected sentence would be: "I have much of the manuscript left to type."
1	Other Category	The sentence "He's a more reliable man" is grammatically correct as it follows standard English syntax rules for forming comparative phrases ("more \_\_") and subject-verb agreement (he = singular; is = singular form of the verb "to be"). Additionally, there are no morphological errors or semantic inconsistencies. Therefore, I have labeled this input as 1, indicating grammatical correctness.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a subject ("any trouble") and a verb ("is"), but it lacks a proper object or complement for the verb. A more appropriate way to phrase the sentence would be "I don't want any trouble." This version includes a clear subject (implied by the pronoun "I") and an explicit object ("trouble").
1	Syntax	The sentence “They may grow as high as bamboo” is grammatically correct. Here’s why: * The subject “they” refers to a plural antecedent (understood from context or previously mentioned). * The verb phrase “may grow” uses the auxiliary modal verb “may” followed by the base form of the verb “grow.” This indicates possibility or permission. * The adverbial prepositional phrase “as high as bamboo” compares their height using the comparative word “as,” the infinitive marker “high,” and the noun “bamboo” as a reference point for comparison. All these elements work together to create a coherent meaning, making it syntactically correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a syntactic error. In the phrase "as many errors as 20," the word "errors" is plural but the number "20" is singular. To make it grammatically correct, we can say "as many errors as twenty." Alternatively, if we want to keep the number in digits, we would need to change the noun to its singular form: "as many an error as 20."
0	Syntax	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in this sentence. In English, a singular third person subject requires a verb ending in "-s" or "-es", while plural subjects do not have any additional marking on the verb. Here, the subject "Sally" is singular, so it should be followed by a verb without "-s". However, the verb "kissed" implies a plural subject (or reflexive pronoun), but "himself" cannot function as both a direct object and reflexive pronoun for "Sally." Thus, the grammatically correct form would be "Sally kissed herself," using the proper feminine reflexive pronoun.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Drew believes I think Rosie loves magazine ads." is grammatically correct. It has a clear subject ("Drew") and predicate ("believes..."), and follows standard SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) word order. Each clause ("Drew believes", "I think", "Rosie loves magazine ads") is well-formed and connected through appropriate conjunctions or subordinating conjunctions. All words used have proper morphological forms fitting their grammatical roles.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Dave, Dan, Erin, Jaime, and Alina left" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules for subject-verb agreement (the plural subject "Dave, Dan, Erin, Jaime, and Alina" matches the plural verb "left") and word order (the subjects come before the verbs). Additionally, all proper nouns are spelled correctly and there are no missing or extra words. Therefore, the sentence does not contain any errors in syntax, semantics, morphology, or other grammatical components.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Hopefully, we'll make it through the winter without snow." is grammatically correct. It consists of a subordinating conjunction ("hopefully") followed by a complete clause ("we'll make it through the winter without snow"). This structure creates a dependent clause, which modifies the main independent clause of the sentence. All elements within the sentence are used correctly and form coherent meaning, making it free from any syntax errors.
0	Syntax	In this sentence, there is a subject-verb agreement error. The subject of the sentence is "blue leather," which is singular, but the verb "shows" is plural. Additionally, it is unclear how blue leather could show that someone is pretty. This suggests that there may be some confusion about what the subject and predicate of the sentence should be. A possible correction might be: "Betsy's blue leather handbag shows that she is pretty." However, without more context, it is difficult to say for sure what the intended meaning of the sentence is or how best to revise it.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Gwen hit the baseball" is grammatically correct. In this sentence, "Gwen" is the subject, "hit" is the verb, and "the baseball" is the object. This structure follows the basic rules of English syntax. Therefore, it is a syntactically correct sentence.
0	Syntax	The correct form of the verb to be after the pronoun "you" is "know," not "hit." Additionally, there needs to be a conjunction such as "that" between "I hit" and "you knew the answer" for the two clauses to make sense together. So the corrected sentence would read: "I said something that made you know the answer."
1	Semantics	This sentence is grammatically correct. The disjunction ("or") between two noun clauses indicates a choice between two undesirable outcomes. While it may seem informal or colloquial, there is no syntactic or morphological error present in this statement.
1	Syntax	The sentence "It was a brand new car that he bought" is grammatically correct. The subject "it" is followed by the linking verb "was", which agrees with the singular subject in number. The adjective phrase "a brand new" correctly modifies the noun "car". Finally, the relative clause "that he bought" provides additional information about the car. In terms of syntax, all elements are arranged according to standard rules for word order and structure in English.
1	Syntax	The sentence "He likes cookies and he hates crumb cake." is grammatically correct. The subject-verb agreement is consistent throughout the sentence (he likes, he hates), and there are no misspelled words or incorrect punctuation marks. Additionally, the coordinating conjunction "and" connects two independent clauses effectively. Therefore, I would classify any errors found within this sentence as falling under the category of syntax if they existed. However, since it does not contain any such issues, my final assessment for this input is 1, indicating a grammatically correct sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence "They chased the man with the car" is grammatically correct. In terms of syntax, it follows the standard structure of a simple sentence (Subject-Verb-Object), where "they" is the subject, "chased" is the verb, and "the man with the car" is the object. Additionally, the prepositional phrase "with the car" modifies "the man," providing more information about who was being chased. Therefore, there are no syntactic errors in this sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence "I didn't have a red cent" is grammatically correct. It uses standard English syntax rules for forming negative statements (subject + auxiliary verb + not + main verb). Additionally, "red cent" is an idiomatic expression meaning "a very small amount of money."
0	Syntax	The error in this sentence lies in its syntax, or word order. Specifically, there are two noun phrases ("the book of poems" and "[from Blackwell]") separated by the conjunction "and," but no verb connecting them. A possible correction could be: "Reading the book of poems and the one from Blackwell takes a very long time."
1	Syntax	The sentence "the one with a red cover takes a very long time to read" is grammatically correct. It follows the standard subject-verb-object (SVO) word order in English. The subject of the sentence is "the one with a red cover," the verb is "takes," and the object is "a very long time to read." Additionally, each word is correctly conjugated and inflected for number and tense. Therefore, there are no syntax errors present in this sentence.
1	Other Category	The sentence "John has a fear of dogs." is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple subject ("John") and a predicate ("has a fear of dogs"). Additionally, it follows standard English word order (Subject-Verb-Object). Therefore, there are no syntax, semantic, or morphological errors present in the sentence.
0	Syntax	In English, we typically say "The roof of the building is leaking," not "The building's the roof is leaking." This is because the possessive form ("building's") cannot be used to modify a noun (in this case, "roof"). Instead, we use the genitive construction ("of the building"), where "of" functions as a preposition introducing the noun phrase "the building".
0	Syntax	The noun phrase "the panther's" contains a possessive apostrophe indicating possession, but what follows it ("the coat") is not a modifier describing the panther. Instead, it appears to be the subject of the sentence. Therefore, we would expect a verb to follow "panther's." A possible correction could be "The panther has a dark black coat," or simply "The panther's coat is dark black," without the initial definite article "the."
1	Syntax	The sentence "Colin asked if they could get a mortgage" is grammatically correct. The subject of the main clause is "Colin," and the verb is "asked." The subordinate conjunction "if" introduces the dependent clause "they could get a mortgage," where "they" serves as the subject and "could get" functions as the verb phrase. Additionally, the noun "mortgage" is correctly used after the modal verb "could." Therefore, there are no syntax errors in this sentence.
0	Semantics	This sentence is semantically incorrect because it implies that the man who got into the taxi committed the robbery. However, without additional context, we cannot assume that the man who was seen getting into a cab is the same person who later robbed the bank. These two events could have been perpetrated by different individuals. Therefore, the sentence contains a logical fallacy known as a false cause or cum hoc ergo propter hoc.
1	Syntax	The sentence "I know you eat asparagus." is grammatically correct. The subject "I" is followed by a verb "know", then there is a subordinating conjunction "that" (implied here) introducing the clause "you eat asparagus". This clause has its own subject "you" and predicate "eat asparagus". Therefore, there is no syntax error in this sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence "John's drum will always bother me" is grammatically correct. The noun phrase "John's drum" consists of a genitive noun ("John's") modifying the head noun "drum." This forms a possessive relationship between "John" and "drum," indicating ownership or association. The verb tense is consistent throughout the sentence, using the future tense "will bother" to indicate a continuous action or state that has yet to occur. Additionally, word order follows standard English syntax rules for declarative sentences (Subject-Verb-Object). Overall, there are no grammatical errors present in this sentence.
1	Semantics	The sentence "An evil thought struck Dave" is grammatically correct. The word "struck" is used correctly as a past tense verb indicating that something (in this case, an evil thought) has affected or influenced Dave. The use of an article ("an") before "evil thought" indicates that it's a specific instance of an evil thought rather than the concept of an evil thought in general, which is appropriate for the context. Therefore, there are no syntax, morphological, or other errors in this sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence "In the classroom John put the book on the table" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * It has a clear subject ("John") who performs the action (putting) indicated by the verb ("put"). * The direct object of the verb ("the book") specifies what was put. * Prepositional phrases ("in the classroom," "on the table") modify the meaning of the sentence without affecting its grammatical structure. * All words used in their proper forms according to morphological rules. Therefore, there are no syntax errors or other issues related to semantics, morphology, etc., making it a valid English sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Phillip gave the medal to the soldier" is grammatically correct. It follows standard Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) word order in English where Phillip is the subject, gave is the verb, and the medal is the direct object. To the soldier indicates the indirect object showing whom or what Philip gave the medal. Therefore, it's syntactically well formed.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a syntactic error where the infinitive marker 'to' appears before the verb 'eat'. In English, we say 'to eat', but here it seems as if 'Andy' is being used as the direct object instead of 'salmon flavored candy bars'. A correct version would be 'Heidi thinks that Andy should eat salmon flavored candy bars.'
1	Syntax	The sentence "Heidi thinks that Andy should eat salmon flavored candy bars" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules for English syntax. Specifically, the subject ("Heidi") comes before the verb ("thinks"), and there is a clear relationship established between the two clauses using the subordinating conjunction "that." Additionally, each word within the sentence is used correctly and agrees with other words in terms of number and tense. Overall, I would rate this sentence as syntactically sound.
1	Syntax	The sentence "He danced" is grammatically correct. The subject "he" agrees with the verb "danced" in number (both singular), and the word order is correct for a simple sentence in English. Additionally, there are no spelling or morphological errors in the sentence.
0	Syntax	The verb "did" requires a bare infinitive form as its complement, but here we have the possessive form "his" instead of the base form "do." So, the correct question would be: "Did Calvin do his homework?"
1	Syntax	The sentence "Sylvia was slapping Jeff upside the head in martial arts class" is grammatically correct. It follows the standard subject-verb-object (SVO) word order in English, where "Sylvia" is the subject, "was slapping" is the verb phrase, and "Jeff upside the head" is the object. Additionally, the use of present continuous tense ("was slapping") correctly indicates an ongoing action in the past. Therefore, there are no syntax errors in this sentence.
1	Other Category	The sentence "If I am a rich man, I'd buy a diamond ring" is grammatically correct. It contains an if-clause (if + subject + verb) followed by a main clause (subject + would + verb). Both clauses follow standard rules for word order and tense agreement. Therefore, there are no syntax or morphological errors in the sentence. Additionally, the meaning of the sentence is clear and unambiguous, indicating that it has no semantic issues either. Thus, the category of the answer is "Other Category," as none of the specific error types listed apply.
1	Syntax	The sentence "If he were a rich man, he'd buy a diamond ring" is grammatically correct. It contains a subjunctive mood, which is used to express various states of unreality such as doubt, possibility, necessity, or action that has not yet occurred. In this case, the verb "were" indicates a hypothetical situation where "he" is a rich man. Therefore, there is no mistake in this sentence.
1	Other Category	The sentence "John is likely to leave" is grammatically correct. Therefore, I am returning a 1 for this example. This sentence does not contain any errors in syntax (word order), semantics (meaning), or morphology (structure of words). So, it falls under the category of 'Other'.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject ("The manager") is followed by a verb ("laughed"), making it a simple, complete sentence. Additionally, there are no spelling or punctuation errors present.
0	Syntax	The sentence "Was sunk." is a fragment because it lacks a subject. A complete sentence needs both a subject and a predicate (verb). In order for this sentence to be grammatically correct, we would need to know what was sunk. For example, if the intended meaning is "The ship was sunk," then the sentence has a subject ("the ship") and a verb ("was sunk"), making it a complete sentence.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a mistake in subject-verb agreement. In the question, "who" serves as the subject but it is singular while "did think" (which implies "thought") requires a plural verb form for its subject. Therefore, the corrected version of the sentence would be "Who did you think had kissed the gorilla?" or "Who do you think kissed the gorilla?" depending on context.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Have you seen my model airplane collection?" is grammatically correct. The auxiliary verb "have" is used correctly as a helping verb to form a question in the present perfect tense. The subject-auxiliary inversion required for questions has been done properly. All words are spelled correctly and there are no grammatical or syntactical errors in the sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence "It seems that Lucy was mugged" is grammatically correct because it follows standard English syntax rules for word order, subject-verb agreement, and tense consistency. The phrase "it seems" functions as a hedge introducing the declarative main clause "Lucy was mugged," where "was" agrees with singular noun "Lucy." Additionally, both clauses share past tense consistent with the reported event's time frame.
1	Syntax	The sentence "I ate a salad that was filled with lima beans" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules for subject-verb agreement, word order, and proper use of tense. In addition, the modifying phrase "that was filled with lima beans" provides additional information about the noun "salad," making the meaning clear. Therefore, there are no errors in syntax, semantics, or morphology.
1	Syntax	The sentence "There were four men arriving at the station when I pulled up." is grammatically correct. It follows the rules for subject-auxiliary verb agreement (there + were) and uses a present participle ("arriving") correctly within the temporal clause "when I pulled up". Therefore, there are no syntax errors in this sentence.
1	Other Category	The sentence "Jean is reluctant to dance." is grammatically correct. The word "reluctant" correctly describes the subject's attitude towards dancing. Therefore, there is no mistake in syntax, semantics or morphology.
1	Syntax	The sentence "I want her to dance" follows the standard Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) word order in English. The subject "I" is followed by the verb "want", and the object "her to dance". Additionally, the dependent clause "to dance" correctly uses the infinitive form of the verb "dance." Overall, there are no syntactic or morphological errors present in this sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Jean persuaded Robert." is grammatically correct because it follows standard Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) word order in English, where "Jean" is the subject, "persuaded" is the verb, and "Robert" is the object. Additionally, each word is correctly conjugated for tense and number, making this a syntactically sound sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Jean wants Bill to do the Macarena" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules for English syntax. In this sentence, "Jean" is the subject, "wants" is the verb, and "Bill to do the Macarena" is the object complement. This structure is a common way to express desires or requests in English. Additionally, there are no spelling errors, punctuation errors, or incorrect word choices, so the sentence is free from other types of grammatical errors as well. Overall, the sentence is syntactically sound and can be understood by native speakers without any confusion.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the rules for English syntax. Specifically, the subject ("the children") comes before the verb ("admire"), and the object ("their mother") correctly receives the action expressed by the verb. Additionally, there are no spelling or morphological errors in the sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Who has Peter talked with?" is grammatically correct. It follows the standard structure for a question in English, where the subject ("Peter") comes before the auxiliary verb ("has"), and the main verb ("talked") follows the subject. The word order indicates that we are asking about the direct object of the verb ("who"), so the preposition "with" is used correctly after the verb to indicate who Peter was talking to. Overall, there are no syntax errors or other issues affecting the grammaticality of this sentence.
1	Other Category	The sentence "Heidi likes her violin" is grammatically correct. Here's a brief explanation for each category: Syntax refers to how words are put together to form phrases and sentences. This sentence has a subject ("Heidi"), verb ("likes"), and object ("violin") and follows standard English syntax rules. Semantics deals with meaning, both referential (what things does the sentence talk about) and inferential (what can we reasonably assume from what it says). In this case, there is no ambiguity or incorrect implication, so semantics aren't causing any issues here either. Morphology concerns word structure - the internal composition of words as well as their formation. No morphological errors exist in this sentence; all forms used are appropriate. Thus, since there are no errors found under these three aspects, I categorize my response as 'Other'.
0	Syntax	The error in this sentence is syntactic because it relates to the structure of the sentence. Specifically, the pronoun "himself" does not agree with its antecedent "John." In English, reflexive pronouns must agree in number and gender with their antecedents. Therefore, the correct form of the pronoun in this case would be "he," so the sentence should read: "John thinks that Mary loves him."
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a mistake in pronoun reference. In the phrase "pictures of himself," "himself" is a reflexive pronoun referring back to the subject of the sentence, "John." However, since we're talking about pictures (plural), it requires a plural possessive pronoun instead of a singular reflexive pronoun. Therefore, the corrected version would be: "Which pictures of himself does John like?" -> "Which pictures of themselves do John like?"
0	Syntax	The sentence "Any owl hunts mice." contains a small error in its subject-verb agreement. The subject "any owl" is singular, so the verb should be in its third person singular form, i.e., "hunts". However, it would sound more natural if we use a plural noun after "any", as follows: "Any owls hunt mice." This way, both the subject (owls) and the verb (hunt) agree in number, making for better syntax.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a negative quantifier ("no man") but uses a regular (affirmative) verb form instead of a negated one. This error leads to incorrect meaning. In order for the sentence to be grammatically correct, it should read as follows: "No man ate dinner."
1	Syntax	The sentence “A pilot could be flying this plane” is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is a singular noun (“pilot”) followed by a helping verb (“could”), which agrees with the subject in number. The main verb is a present participle phrase (“flying this plane”). This structure implies uncertainty about whether or not the action (flying) is currently happening, but it does not affect the grammaticality of the sentence. Therefore, I would rate this as a syntactically correct sentence.
1	Semantics	The sentence is grammatically correct and semantically meaningful. It suggests that everyone who went to last week's big rally (regardless of their identity) signed a petition. No errors or issues can be found here.
1	Syntax	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows a simple subject-verb-object structure (Anybody who attended last week's huge rally / signed / the petition). The subjects and verbs agree in number, and there are no missing or extra words. Additionally, the modifiers are placed correctly to convey the intended meaning.
1	Semantics	The statement “Any tiger has orange fur, marked with black stripes” is semantically correct because it accurately describes a typical physical attribute of all members within the category of tigers. However, note that there can be variations as some subspecies or individual tigers may have different color patterns due to genetic mutations or age-related changes (e.g., white tigers).
0	Semantics	The statement "Any albino tiger has orange fur, marked with black stripes" is semantically incorrect because albinism is a genetic condition characterized by the absence of melanin, resulting in white or pale hair, skin, and eyes. Therefore, it's impossible for an albino tiger to have orange fur with black stripes since they lack the pigment necessary for producing those colors.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a grammatical error related to subject-verb agreement. The verb "you must pick" requires a plural noun or pronoun as its subject, but the subject here is "you," which is singular. To fix this error, we can change the verb form to match the singular subject by saying "You must pick any flower you see."
1	Syntax	The sentence "Any pilot on duty today could be flying this plane" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "any pilot on duty today," which is a noun clause acting as the subject of the sentence. The verb is "could be flying." This construction correctly uses the subjunctive mood to indicate possibility or hypotheticality. Additionally, the word order follows standard English syntax rules, with the subject coming before the verb. Overall, there are no grammatical errors in this sentence, so it receives a score of 1 for being grammatically correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "You may pick every flower, but leave a few for Mary." is grammatically correct. It contains two independent clauses joined by the coordinating conjunction "but". Both clauses follow standard subject-verb agreement rules and use proper verb tense. Additionally, the commas used in the sentence are correctly placed, ensuring clarity and preventing misinterpretations. Overall, there are no grammatical errors or issues related to syntax, semantics, morphology, or any other category, so it's appropriate to classify this as a syntactically well-formed sentence.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct. It contains two independent clauses ("The Dodgers beat the Red Sox" and "were beaten by the Giants") that are connected by the conjunction "and." Each clause has a subject ("The Dodgers," "were beaten by the Giants") and a verb ("beat," "were beaten"). Additionally, each clause expresses a complete thought, so they can stand alone as separate sentences or be combined into a single compound sentence using a coordinating conjunction such as "and."
1	Other Category	The sentence is grammatically correct but it lacks context or information about who or what the pronoun 'he' refers to. It would be more informative if there was a noun or name preceding 'was seen'. For example, "In which car was John seen?"
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct. It uses a complex sentence structure where two independent clauses ("Mary loves the man" and "Sally hates the man") are connected by the conjunction "and". Additionally, it includes a relative clause ("who Mary loves"), modifying the noun phrase "the man", making it clear whom we're talking about. All elements have been combined correctly without any grammatical or syntactical errors.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct. It uses a relative clause ("which Mary made") to modify the noun phrase "the kennel." The subject-verb agreement is correct as well; the verb "has been" agrees with its plural subject "the kennel," since it refers to both the kennel itself and what's inside (Fido). Additionally, the word order follows standard English syntax rules, making this sentence entirely correct from a syntactic perspective.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Tom said he would and Bill actually did eat a raw eggplant" is grammatically correct. It contains two independent clauses ("Tom said he would" and "Bill actually did eat a raw eggplant") connected by a conjunction ("and"). Both clauses contain a subject and a verb, so the syntax is correct.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a simple sentence (Subject-Verb-Object): The wealthy young man (subject) bought (verb) that piano (object). Additionally, there are no spelling errors or incorrect word choices, making the sentence syntactically sound.
1	Other Category	This sentence is grammatically correct and conveys a clear meaning (semantically accurate), there are no issues with word formation (morphologically sound) or grammatical structure (syntactically correct). Therefore it falls under 'Other Category'.
1	Other Category	The sentence “a tall building” is grammatically correct as it contains a determiner (“a”), an adjective (“tall”) that describes the noun (“building”). However, the sentence seems incomplete because there’s no verb or independent clause. Nonetheless, based on the instructions provided, I am only evaluating whether the sentence is grammatically correct or not, so my response will be 1 (correct) for this example.
1	Other Category	The sentence “This building is tall” is grammatically correct. It consists of a subject (“this building”) and a predicate (“is tall”). The subject refers to a singular noun, so the verb must be in its third person singular form, which it is (i.e., “is” instead of “are”). Additionally, the adjective “tall” correctly modifies the noun by providing information about its height. Therefore, there are no errors in syntax, semantics, or morphology.
1	Syntax	The sentence "I like the book which you gave me." is grammatically correct. In terms of syntax, it follows the standard structure of a simple sentence, consisting of a subject ("I"), a verb ("like"), and an object ("the book"). Additionally, the relative clause "which you gave me" modifies the noun phrase "the book," providing more information about the specific book being referred to. This use of a relative pronoun (in this case, "which") to introduce additional details is also syntactically correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Captain Wentworth wrote a letter to Anne Elliott" is grammatically correct because it follows standard subject-verb-object word order and uses proper punctuation. Additionally, the nouns and verbs agree in number (singular), and there are no misspelled words or incorrect use of tenses. Therefore, I would classify this as a syntax issue since all elements of grammar are correctly applied here.
0	Syntax	In English, we usually put auxiliary (or "helping") verbs before the subject when forming a question. The auxiliary verb here is "was," so it should come before "Alison." A corrected version would be "She asked was Alison coming to the party?" or better yet, "Was Alison coming to the party?"
1	Syntax	The sentence "They realized that never had Sir Thomas been so offended" is grammatically correct. It follows the rules for subject-verb agreement, word order, and tense consistency. The use of the past perfect continuous tense ("had been offended") correctly indicates that Sir Thomas's being offended occurred before another past action (realizing). Therefore, there are no syntax errors in this sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Fanny regretted having to talk to Aunt Norris." is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Fanny", who is performing the action of regret. The verb phrase "regretted having to" correctly uses the past tense of the verb "to regret". Additionally, the infinitive phrase "having to talk to Aunt Norris" functions as the direct object of the sentence, providing additional information about what Fanny is regretting. Overall, the syntax of this sentence follows standard English rules for word order, agreement between subjects and verbs, and use of phrases and clauses.
1	Other Category	The sentence "Knowing the country well, he took a short cut" is grammatically correct. It contains a participial phrase ("knowing the country well") that modifies the subject of the main clause ("he"). This structure is often used in written English to provide additional information about the subject before the main verb. Therefore, there is no mistake in terms of syntax, semantics, or morphology.
1	Syntax	The sentence "He left the train with somebody else's wallet in his pocket." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of syntax. In this case, the subject ("he") comes before the verb ("left"), and there is a clear relationship between the different parts of the sentence established by prepositions ("the train", "with"). Additionally, each word is correctly inflected for tense and number.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Magnus went to Ireland" is grammatically correct. In terms of syntax, it follows a typical subject-verb-object (SVO) structure where "Magnus" is the subject, "went" is the verb, and "Ireland" is the object. Additionally, there are no misspelled words or incorrect word usage, making the morphological and semantic aspects of the sentence accurate as well. Therefore, I would classify any errors present within this sentence under the category of syntax if there were any issues. However, since the sentence is correct, I will mark it accordingly.
0	Syntax	The sentence "Who did John send the book?" is grammatically incorrect because it lacks a proper question word order. In English, auxiliary verbs such as "did" must come before the subject when forming questions. A correct version would be "Who did John send the book to?" or simply "Who did John send the book?" by rearranging the words to have the auxiliary verb ("did") first, followed by the subject ("John").
0	Syntax	This sentence contains a subject-verb agreement error. The subject "the idea" is singular, but the verb "dismayed" is plural. It should be "dismays." Additionally, there is no need for the word "that" in this sentence; it can simply read "The Prime Minister was dismayed the Dome was dull."
0	Syntax	In English, when we use the phrase "X did Y" (where X is a noun or pronoun and Y is a verb), the word order is typically subject-verb-object (SVO). However, if we want to emphasize the action (Y) rather than the subject (X), we can reverse the word order to create an emphatic construction called subject-dependent inversion. This occurs frequently in questions ("Did John eat the cookies?" instead of "John ate the cookies?"), but it's less common in statements. In the original sentence, "he" comes before "did," creating a subject-dependent inversion structure. To make this grammatically correct, we need to add a comma after "in." The corrected version would be: Came right in, he did, without so much as a knock.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct and well-formed according to the rules of syntax in English. The subject ("Harriet") is followed by a verb ("admired"), and there is a proper direct object ("Mr Knightley"). Additionally, the word order follows standard English convention (SVO). No errors can be found in terms of syntactic structure or morphological agreement between words. Therefore, no semantic issues arise since meaning is conveyed clearly due to its grammaticality.
1	Other Category	This sentence is grammatically correct but may be subjective based on opinion. The word "boring" describes the book as unpleasant or dull to read, which can vary from person to person. However, there are no grammatical errors or issues related to syntax, semantics, or morphology in this sentence.
1	Other Category	The sentence "Ethel wishes to ask you some awkward questions" is grammatically correct. Therefore, it returns a value of 1. It does not contain any syntax errors (incorrect arrangement of words), semantic errors (meaningless or contradictory statements), or morphological errors (incorrect use of word forms). Instead, it falls under the category of other grammatical issues, but since there aren't any problems here, no specific category needs to be assigned.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Emma made Harriet some food" is grammatically correct. In terms of syntax, it follows a typical subject-verb-object (SVO) structure where "Emma" is the subject, "made" is the verb, and "some food" is the object. Additionally, there is a possessive noun ("Harriet") used correctly as an indirect object indicating who received the action performed by the subject.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object (SVO) word order in English. Additionally, the verb tense agrees with the time frame established by the context. In this case, there is no specific time frame provided, so we can assume that the action happened in the past based on the use of the past tense "was." Furthermore, the modifying phrase "with a hammer" provides additional information about how the window was broken but does not affect the grammaticality of the rest of the sentence. Overall, this sentence demonstrates proper syntax and usage of English grammar rules.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence ("the fugitive") is clearly identified, and the verb tense is consistent throughout (past tense). Additionally, there is a clear relationship between the clauses in the sentence established through the use of the subordinating conjunction "in order." The word "motionless" functions as an adjective describing the noun phrase "the fugitive," providing additional information about the subject's state of being. Overall, the syntax of this sentence is well-constructed and unambiguous.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct because it follows standard subject-verb-object word order (SVO), where "the guard" is the subject, "marched" is the verb, and "the prisoners" and "round the yard" are objects. Additionally, each word's morphological form agrees with other words in terms of tense and number.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Frank Churchill crossed the street" is grammatically correct because it follows standard subject-verb-object (SVO) word order and has proper verb agreement between the singular noun "Churchill" and the past tense verb "crossed." Additionally, there are no spelling or punctuation errors in this sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Emma and Harriet were attacked yesterday" is grammatically correct. It follows the standard Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) word order in English. The subject of the sentence is "Emma and Harriet," the verb is "were attacked," and the time expression is "yesterday." The coordinating conjunction "and" connects two noun phrases, "Emma" and "Harriet," making them a compound subject. This construction does not violate any rules of syntax or semantics; therefore, it receives a score of 1 for being grammatically correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Fiona might be here by 5 o'clock." is grammatically correct. Here, "might" is a modal verb expressing possibility, followed by the subject "Fiona," the auxiliary verb "be," and the adverbial phrase "by 5 o'clock" indicating when Fiona may arrive. Therefore, there are no syntax errors or other issues related to morphology or semantics in this sentence.
1	Syntax	The conjunction "and" must connect two grammatically parallel elements. In the original sentence, there is no explicit subject for the second clause "of the opinion." A corrected version could be: "I am both expecting to get the job and I think it is a desirable one," or "I am both expecting to get the job and believe it is a desirable one."
1	Semantics	The sentence "Pat was awarded the Golden Fleece Award and very upset about it" is grammatically correct but semantically odd because being awarded an award is typically a positive event, so it's unusual for someone to be "very upset" about receiving an award. However, without further context or clarification, I will assume that the sentence is intended to convey a complex emotion or situation, even if it seems contradictory on the surface. Therefore, my judgment is based solely on grammaticality, and the sentence is indeed grammatically correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a syntactic error because it uses the present participle "-ing" form (beating) after the coordinating conjunction "and." Instead, we need two simple verb forms or two -ing forms for parallelism. Additionally, there's no determiner before "dog," making the noun non-specific. A corrected version could be "Kim alienated cats and beat his dog" or "Kim was alienating cats and beating his dog."
1	Syntax	The sentence "They knew that pictures of each other would be on sale" is grammatically correct. The subject "they" agrees with the verb "knew." The clause "that pictures of each other would be on sale" correctly functions as the direct object of the sentence. Additionally, the reflexive pronoun "each other" is used correctly to indicate reciprocal action between two or more people. Therefore, there are no syntax errors in this sentence.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a pronoun "which" referring to an unspecified noun. This type of construction often leads to confusion about what object or idea is being referred to. In this case, it's unclear what specific articles Terry failed to read. To make the sentence clearer, we could specify the article(s) by saying something like, "Which report(s) did Terry file papers without reading?"
1	Other Category	The sentence "I want to try and buy some whisky" is grammatically correct. In this case, "try and" functions as a correlative conjunction, connecting two verbs, "try" and "buy". However, it is more common and idiomatic to use "try to" instead of "try and", so a better version of the sentence would be "I want to try to buy some whisky." Nonetheless, the original sentence is still technically correct, so I am giving it a score of 1.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a syntactic error where two verb phrases ("goes" and "buying") are directly connected without any coordinating conjunction or appropriate tense agreement. A corrected version could be either "She goes and buys some whiskey" (with the proper form of the verb) or "She is going and buying some whiskey" (using continuous tenses consistently).
0	Syntax	In English, a linking verb (e.g., "is") must agree in number with its subject. The subject "Kim and Terry" is plural, so the correct form of the linking verb would be "are." Therefore, the corrected sentence is "Kim and Terry are happy."
1	Syntax	The sentence "Kim gave a dollar to Bobbie and a dime to Jean." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules for syntax in English. Specifically, the subject (Kim) comes before the verb (gave), and the objects of the verbs (a dollar, Bobbie, a dime, and Jean) follow them in the appropriate order. Additionally, the coordinating conjunction "and" connects two independent clauses properly.
1	Syntactic Ambiguity	The sentence contains no grammatical or spelling errors; however, it does have syntactic ambiguity due to the phrase 'and on your desk'. It can be interpreted in two ways - (a) she will physically place a photo both inside the mailbox and on your desk, or (b) she will send a picture via mail and additionally place another picture on your desk. To avoid confusion, rewording would help for clarity.
1	Syntax	The sentence appears to be grammatically correct. It contains a subject ("the girl in the red coat"), a verb ("will put"), and an object ("a picture of Bill"). Additionally, it uses proper tense agreement (future) throughout the sentence. Furthermore, there are no obvious morphological errors or semantic inconsistencies. Therefore, I would classify this as syntactically correct.
1	Other Category	The sentence appears grammatically correct, but it could be clearer for ease of understanding. A more precise way to phrase it might be: "This girl in the red coat will put a picture of Bill on your desk by tomorrow." This clarifies whether she will do it sometime during the course of the day or right before it turns into tomorrow.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Ann bought a first edition of Richard III for $1000." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a simple sentence (Subject + Verb + Object), where "Ann" is the subject, "bought" is the verb, and "a first edition of Richard III for $1000" is the object. Additionally, the use of prepositional phrases such as "of Richard III" and "for $1000" provide further details about the object without affecting the grammaticality of the sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence "John became deadly afraid of flying" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "John" is a proper noun functioning as the subject of the sentence. * "became" is the past tense of the verb "to become," indicating a change in state or condition. * "deadly afraid" functions together as an adverb phrase modifying the verb "become." While some might argue that "deadly" is unnecessary here since it implies harm to others rather than oneself, its use does not make the sentence ungrammatical. * "of flying" is a prepositional phrase acting as an adverbial complement specifying what John became afraid of. Overall, the syntax of the sentence follows standard English rules for word order and structure.
1	Syntax	The sentence "What John promised is to be gentle." is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "what" serves as a relative pronoun referring back to the direct object of the verb "promised" (an infinitive phrase). * "John promised" is the finite main clause of the sentence. * "to be gentle" is a subordinate infinitival clause acting as the subject complement, providing more information about what was promised. The syntax follows standard rules for forming complex sentences using a relative clause. Therefore, it falls under the category of Syntax, and there are no errors found.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a missing article before the word "books." The corrected sentence would be: "Henri wants to buy which *the* books about cooking?" or "Henri wants to buy which books about *the* cooking?"
1	Syntax	The sentence "I will fix the computer for Carol" is grammatically correct. The subject "I" is followed by a verb tense "will fix," indicating future action. The direct object "the computer" receives the action of the verb. Finally, the prepositional phrase "for Carol" provides additional information about the recipient of the action. No syntax errors are present in this sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Smith loaned a valuable collection of manuscripts to the library" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure for an English sentence (Subject-Verb-Object), where "Smith" is the subject, "loaned" is the verb, and "a valuable collection of manuscripts" is the object. Additionally, the use of the past tense ("loaned") is appropriate for describing a completed action. Furthermore, the prepositional phrase "to the library" correctly indicates the recipient of the action. Therefore, there are no syntax errors in this sentence.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct and follows standard English syntax rules for subject-verb-object word order (Mary - cuts - the paper). Additionally, there is a proper use of the past tense verb form ("cut") indicating completed action.
1	Syntax	The sentence "It was from six to nine or it took place from six to nine" is grammatically correct. Both clauses are independent clauses, joined by the coordinating conjunction "or." However, stylistically, it would be better to use a shorter version such as "It occurred from six to nine," since repeating "it was from six to nine or it took place from six to nine" may sound redundant.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Suddenly, there arrived two inspectors from the INS" is grammatically correct. It follows the standard structure of a sentence, having a subject ("there"), a verb ("arrived"), and an object ("two inspectors"). Additionally, it uses proper tense (past), making the sentence syntactically accurate.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct. It consists of two independent clauses joined by a comma and conjunction (coordinating conjunction), following the standard format for compound sentences in English ("The soup cooks," and "thickens"). Both clauses have subjects ("the soup" and implicit subject "it") and verbs ("cooks" and "thickens"), so they can stand alone as separate sentences if needed.
1	Syntax	The sentence "I gave money to the charity" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "I", the verb is "gave", and the indirect object is "money" while "to the charity" is the prepositional phrase acting as the recipient of the action described by the verb "gave". Therefore, there is no mistake in terms of syntax in this sentence.
1	Other Category	The sentence "John asked." is grammatically correct. It consists of a proper noun "John" as the subject and the past tense verb "asked". Since there are no errors related to syntax, semantics or morphology, it falls under the category 'Other'.
0	Semantics	The sentence "I saw even the student" is semantically incorrect because the word "even" is used incorrectly. In English, "even" is typically used before a specific noun or pronoun to emphasize its inclusion or unexpectedness in a group or situation. For example, we could say "I saw even the shyest student." However, without any additional context or words, it's unclear what is being emphasized by using "even" in this way. Therefore, the sentence requires revision to be grammatically correct and convey the intended meaning more clearly.
0	Syntax	The sentence "John whispered Mary left" is syntactically incorrect because it lacks a main verb for the subject "Mary." A corrected version could be "John whispered that Mary had left," where "had left" functions as the past perfect tense of the verb "to leave" for the subject "Mary."
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a subjunctive mood error. In English, when we express doubt or uncertainty about a statement (especially with words such as wonder, think, suppose), we use a different verb form even if the subject is he, she, or it. Therefore, the correct version would be "Mary wonders whether Bill will come."
0	Syntax	The sentence "Sophie will theater" is grammatically incorrect because it lacks a proper verb. It seems that there was supposed to be a verb after "will," but instead, the noun "theater" was used. A corrected version could be "Sophie will go to the theater."
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the rules for subject-verb agreement (the subjects "John" and "he" both agree with the verb "finished") and word order (the direct objects "the cake" and "the lemonade" follow their respective verbs). Additionally, the coordinating conjunction "and" connects two independent clauses, each containing a complete thought.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Herself likes Mary's mother" is grammatically correct. Here, "herself" is a reflexive pronoun used as the subject of the sentence, and it refers back to the implied subject (the speaker or writer). However, since there is no context provided, using "herself" might seem unusual unless the speaker has previously established themselves as being related to Mary. Nonetheless, syntactically speaking, the sentence is correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Each of the boys fought with some of the other boys" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "each of the boys," which is a determiner phrase acting as a quantifier for the noun "boys." This is followed by the verb "fought," indicating past tense. The preposition "with" introduces the prepositional phrases "with some of the other boys," specifying who or what was involved in the fighting. Overall, the syntax (word order and structure) of this sentence follows standard English rules.
0	Syntax	The error in this sentence is syntactic because it relates to the structure of the sentence. In this case, the pronoun used needs to match the gender and number of the antecedent (the word the pronoun refers back to). Here, "himself" does not agree with its antecedent "John's mother". Instead, we should use a reflexive pronoun such as "herself", so the corrected sentence would be: "John's mother likes herself."
0	Syntax	The subject of the sentence, "Mary," is a female name, so it does not match with the reflexive pronoun used in the sentence, "himself." In English, when the subject of the sentence is feminine, we use the reflexive pronoun "herself" instead of "himself." Therefore, the grammatically correct version of this sentence would be "Mary revealed herself to John."
1	Syntax	The sentence "Mary believes that Bill saw himself" is grammatically correct. In terms of syntax, it follows the standard structure of a complex sentence, consisting of an independent clause ("Mary believes") and a dependent clause ("that Bill saw himself"). Additionally, the reflexive pronoun "himself" correctly refers back to the subject of the embedded clause, "Bill." Therefore, there are no syntactic errors in this sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence "John heard that they criticized themselves" is grammatically correct. In terms of syntax, it follows the rules for word order and structure in English. The subject "John" comes before the verb "heard," and the clause "that they criticized themselves" correctly functions as the direct object of the sentence. Additionally, each word within the sentence has been used appropriately and agrees with other words in number and tense. Therefore, there are no syntactic errors present in this sentence.
1	Other Category	The sentence "Mary thinks that she is smart." is grammatically correct. It consists of a main clause "Maries thinks" and a subordinate clause "she is smart," both of which have appropriate subject-verb agreement and punctuation. Additionally, there are no errors in morphological formation or semantic meaning. Therefore, it falls under the category of 'Other' as it does not contain any specific error related to syntax, semantics, or morphology.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Henry found that Bill is sad." is grammatically correct. In terms of syntax, it follows the rules for word order and structure in English. The subject ("Henry") comes before the verb ("found"), and the dependent clause ("that Bill is sad") provides additional information about what Henry found.
0	Syntax	The reflexive pronoun should be coreferential with the subject of the sentence, but here it seems to refer to "Mary" instead. A correct version would be "John considers Mary proud." Alternatively, if John's pride about Mary herself is intended, a possible correction could be "John considers himself proud of himself because of Mary."
0	Syntax	The correct form of the sentence would be "You should sit there before him/her." or "You should sit there first.", because in the original sentence, it sounds as if the person being referred to by "you" should physically place their body in front of a location called "there". However, I assume what was meant is for the person to do something at that location prior to some other event, so rephrasing is necessary to convey this meaning clearly.
1	Syntax	The sentence "There is a nurse available." is grammatically correct. In this sentence, "there" serves as an expletive subject, while "a nurse" functions as the real subject. This structure is called existential construction, which is used to indicate the existence or presence of something. Additionally, the verb "is" agrees with the singular subject "nurse," making the syntax of the sentence accurate.
0	Semantics	The sentence "Everyone hopes everyone to sleep" contains a semantic error. In this context, we would typically expect the verb "hopes" to be followed by a subject and then a base form of a verb (i.e., "that + subject + base form of a verb"). However, here it is followed directly by "everyone," which does not make sense as a grammatical construction. A more appropriate way to phrase the sentence might be: "Everyone hopes that everyone else will get some sleep."
1	Syntax	The sentence "Everyone hopes that he will sleep" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "Everyone" is a singular, gender-neutral pronoun used as the subject of the sentence. It agrees with the verb "hopes." * "hopes" is the third-person singular present tense form of the verb "to hope," indicating that the subject (everyone) has this feeling or expectation. * "that" introduces a subordinate clause, introducing additional information about what everyone hopes for. * "he" refers to a male individual who may be sleeping later. Although it might seem awkward to use "he" instead of a more inclusive term such as "they," using "he" here does not make the sentence ungrammatical. * "will sleep" indicates that someone referred to by "he" will rest later on. This phrase uses the auxiliary verb "will" followed by the base form of the verb "sleep." Together they create the future tense.
0	Semantics	The sentence contains a semantic error known as ambiguity. Specifically, it's unclear whether "Churchill" refers to two different people or the same person twice. To clarify, the sentence could be rewritten as follows: "Only Winston Churchill remembered Winston Churchill giving the 'Blood, Sweat and Tears' speech." Alternatively, if there was only one person named Churchill being referred to, the sentence could be written as: "Winston Churchill alone remembered giving the 'Blood, Sweat and Tears' speech."
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a syntax error related to subject-verb agreement. In the third person singular (he, she, it), verbs must end in -s or -es. Therefore, the verb 'promise' needs an s at the end because its subject 'John' is third person singular. Also, 'himself' refers back to 'John', so we need to use 'shaves'. So, the corrected form will be 'John promises Mary to shave himself.'
1	Syntax	The sentence "John convinced Bill that Mary should sleep" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules for English syntax. In this case, the sentence has a subject ("John"), a verb ("convinced") that agrees with the subject in number (singular), and two objects ("Bill" and "that Mary should sleep"). The clause "that Mary should sleep" functions as the direct object of the sentence, while "Mary" serves as the subject of the embedded infinitive phrase. Overall, the sentence structure is clear and unambiguous, making it a syntactically well-formed expression.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a syntactic error known as a run-on or fused sentence. This occurs when two independent clauses (i.e., complete thoughts) are joined without proper punctuation or conjunction. In this case, there is no comma or coordinating conjunction between "I saw Bill" and "you did so Mary." To fix this issue, we can either add a comma followed by a coordinating conjunction ("and," "but," "or," etc.) or insert a semicolon. Here's how it could be corrected: * Correct version 1: I saw Bill, and you did so Mary. * Correct version 2: I saw Bill; you did so Mary.
0	Syntax	The verb "give" needs to agree with its subject in number. In this case, "Bill" is singular, so the verb must be the third person singular form "gives." Additionally, there needs to be a word (such as "what") between the subject of the second clause ("he") and the verb. So the corrected sentence would read: "What Mary did was give Bill a book," or better yet, for clarity, "Mary's action was giving Bill a book."
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct, so I will return a score of 1. In terms of syntax (the arrangement of words to create meaningful sentences), each word has been placed correctly according to its part of speech and function within the sentence.
1	Syntactic Ambiguity Resolution	The sentence "to steal talismans from witches is dangerous" is grammatically correct but syntactically ambiguous because it's unclear whether it means stealing talismans from a specific group of witches is dangerous or if possessing talismans stolen from any witch is dangerous. In writing, additional context would be needed to clarify the intended meaning. However, as-is, there is no grammatical error, so I will mark it as correct (label = 1).
0	Syntax	The sentence "Anson demonized" is grammatically incorrect because it lacks a complete thought or predicate. A noun (in this case, "Anson") needs a verb or predicate to form a complete sentence. In its current state, the sentence does not make sense without additional context.
0	Syntax	The verb "kick" requires a singular or plural noun as its subject, but "yourselves" is a reflexive pronoun. In addition, using a reflexive pronoun implies that the action was performed by the same group referred to by the subject, so it's unusual (but possible) for the subject and object to be different forms of the same person/number. A more natural way to phrase this would be "you kicked each other."
0	Syntax	This sentence contains a syntactic error known as redundancy or repetition. Specifically, there are two instances of the conjunction "that" which are unnecessary and create confusion about the relationships between the clauses. A corrected version could be: "The book I said I’d never read."
0	Syntax	The verb "demonize" requires a direct object to complete its meaning, but there is no noun or pronoun after it in this sentence for it to act upon. Additionally, the phrase "up the Khyber" does not make sense without additional context. A corrected version could be "Anson demonized the leader," where "leader" serves as the direct object of the verb "demonize."
1	Semantics	The sentence "It is not true that I might be going to the party" is grammatically correct. However, it seems a little awkward or unnatural because the word "not" negates both "true" and "might," making them contradictory. A more natural way to express uncertainty about attending a party would be "I might not be going to the party." But since the original sentence is still grammatical, we can consider it correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence "Kick you!" is syntactically incorrect because it lacks a subject. In English, every complete sentence must have both a subject and a predicate (verb). A corrected version could be "He kicks you" or "You kick me."
1	Syntactically Correct	The sentence "Jason persuaded the doctor to treat Medea" follows the rules of syntax for English grammar. It contains a subject ("Jason"), a verb ("persuaded") and two objects ("the doctor" and "Medea"). Additionally, it includes the proper use of infinitive verbs ("to treat") following the conjunction "to." Overall, there are no obvious errors in terms of word order or usage that would warrant classifying this as semantically incorrect.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a pronoun “you” but there is no antecedent for it in the sentence. Antecedents are words or phrases that precede a pronoun and give meaning to it by telling what the pronoun refers to. In this case, we do not know who “you” refers to because there is no clear antecedent provided. Additionally, the phrase “an accurate description” needs an article before it (i.e., “a accurate description” should be either “an accurate description” or just “accuracy”). Therefore, the corrected sentence could read as follows: “Who gave an accurate description?”
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct. The noun phrase "The Peter" functions as the subject of the sentence, while the verb "was" agrees in number with it (singular). Additionally, there is a prepositional phrase "at the party" functioning as an adverbial modifier specifying where the action occurred.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct. It follows standard English syntax rules for subject-verb agreement (the singular subject "government's" matches with the singular verb "imposes"), possessive noun formation ("government's" shows possession), and word order.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Did Athena help us?" is grammatically correct. It follows the standard structure for asking a question in English by using auxiliary verb "did" before subject "Athena". Additionally, the tense of the verb ("help") agrees with its subject ("Athena").
1	Syntax	The sentence "You wanted to meet the man I saw" is grammatically correct. Here's why: Syntax refers to the arrangement of words to create meaningful sentences. In this case, the subject ("you") comes before the verb ("wanted"), and there is a clear relationship between the two clauses (the dependent clause "I saw" modifies the independent clause "you wanted"). Additionally, the article "the" precedes the noun phrase "man I saw," indicating that the speaker is referring to a specific person who has already been mentioned or is known by both parties involved in the conversation. Overall, the syntax of this sentence is unambiguous and correctly constructed.
1	Syntax	The sentence "Anson demonized David every day" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object (SVO) word order in English. The subject ("Anson") comes first, followed by the verb ("demonized"), and then the object ("David"). The phrase "every day" correctly modifies the verb and indicates how often the action occurred. Therefore, there are no syntax errors in this sentence.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a missing article before the word 'programme'. A more grammatically correct version would be: "There is a program about Euripides on Radio 4 tonight." or "There is a radio programme about Euripides on tonight."
1	Syntax	The sentence "Medea denied poisoning the phoenix" is grammatically correct. It follows standard English syntax rules for word order and structure. In this sentence, the subject (Medea) comes before the verb (denied), and the object (poisoning the phoenix) comes after the verb. This pattern is typical of simple declarative sentences in English. Additionally, there are no spelling or morphological errors in the sentence.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct. It follows standard English syntax rules for word order and structure. The subject ("the elixir") comes before the verb ("was"), and there is a clear relationship between the different parts of the sentence established through prepositions ("in" and "on").
0	Syntax	The sentence "Extremely frantically, Anson danced at Trade" contains a syntax error because it lacks a clear object or destination for the verb "danced." It seems as though there may be missing information after "Trade," such as "Trade Show" or "Trade Center." Additionally, if we assume that "Trade" is meant to refer to some sort of event where people dance, then it could potentially function as the location within a prepositional phrase (e.g., "at Trade"), but even so, the overall structure of the sentence remains unclear without further context.
0	Syntax	This sentence has multiple syntax errors. The first error occurs with the word "who." In this context, it is unclear what "who" refers to because there is no previously mentioned noun or pronoun for it to modify. Additionally, the verb tense is inconsistent; "asked" requires a past participle ("what had been asked"), but instead only a bare infinitive ("what ask") follows. Finally, the last part of the question, "Medea gave," lacks necessary information about what was given. A corrected version could be: "What did you ask when Medea gave the poison?"
1	Syntax	The sentence "It's Anson that I like" is grammatically correct. Here, "it" is a dummy subject used for emphasis or to introduce a clause, while "Anson" is the subject complement of the linking verb "is." The structure of the sentence follows standard English syntax rules.
0	Syntax	The verb "tried" should be followed by a base form of the verb (in this case, "to poison" should just be "poison"). Also, there needs to be a preposition before "her" for the indirect object ("Medea tried to poison her children through the nurse" would be grammatically correct).
0	Semantics	The sentence contains a semantic error. The verb tense does not agree between the two clauses. It should be either "I feel that I knew you" or "I felt that I know you", but both options would still have some ambiguity regarding whether the speaker knows the person currently or only in the past. A clearer way to express the intended meaning might be "I felt as if I knew you," indicating familiarity rather than certain knowledge.
0	Syntax	In standard English grammar, we cannot use both modal verbs (will, can, may, etc.) together in a single verb phrase. Therefore, the sentence "Will he can do it?" contains a syntax error. The correct form would be either "Will he do it?" or "Can he do it?"
0	Syntax	The sentence "I ate that she was happy" is grammatically incorrect due to a syntax error. In English grammar, clauses beginning with "that" (called declarative content clauses) function as nouns within a larger sentence. However, they cannot be used as the direct object of a verb such as "ate." A possible correction could be: "I knew that she was happy," where "that she was happy" functions as the direct object of the verb "knew."
1	Syntax	The sentence "Anson believed himself to be handsome" is grammatically correct. In this sentence, "himself" is a reflexive pronoun that refers back to the subject of the sentence, "Anson." This type of construction is common in English and is used when the subject of the sentence performs some action on itself. Here, the verb is "believed," and it is followed by the infinitive phrase "to be handsome." Overall, the syntax of this sentence follows standard English rules.
1	Syntax	The sentence "We arrived about six o'clock" is grammatically correct. Here, "we" is a subject pronoun, "arrived" is a verb in past tense, "about" is a preposition indicating approximation, and "six o'clock" is a noun phrase acting as an adverbial of time. Therefore, there is no error in syntax or any other aspect of grammar.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a past participle verb form "has fought" but lacks an auxiliary verb or the main verb "to be." A more appropriate way to phrase this would be "Gilgamesh has fought the dragon," or if we want to use the present perfect continuous tense (which implies an action begun in the past and continuing up until now), it could be written as "Gilgamesh has been fighting the dragon."
0	Syntax	The reflexive pronoun "himself" cannot be used as a subject of a clause; it must refer back to another noun or pronoun within the same clause. In this case, "Anson" is the subject of the clause, so we need to use a regular personal pronoun instead. A possible correction would be "Anson thought he was happy."
1	Semantics	The sentence "Fortunately Hermione passed biology" is grammatically correct and its meaning can be easily understood. In terms of semantics (the study of meaning), there is no ambiguity or confusion about what the speaker is trying to convey. Therefore, I would classify this as a semantic evaluation since it does not contain any errors related to syntax, morphology, or other grammatical components.
1	Semantics	The sentence "I might be not going to the party but washing my hair" is grammatically correct, although it can be restructured for clarity as "I might not go to the party; instead, I'll wash my hair." Here, there is no semantic issue since both actions (not attending a party and washing hair) make sense individually. However, without proper context or additional information, we cannot determine if these two actions conflict or coincide.
0	Syntax	The reflexive pronoun used here (myself) does not agree with the subject form (I). Instead, we need to use the object form (me), so the correct sentence would be "I thought he liked me." In English, when using a verb like 'thought' or 'said', it takes two objects - a direct object (in this case, 'he') and an indirect object ('me'). Reflexive pronouns such as 'myself' can only be used when there is already a clear antecedent earlier in the sentence.
1	Syntax	This sentence is grammatically correct because it follows standard English syntax rules for word order (subject-verb-object). In this case, "the butler" is the subject, "sent" is the verb, and "the poison" is the direct object. Additionally, each word is spelled correctly and uses appropriate morphological forms based on tense and number agreement.
0	Semantics	The sentence contains multiple instances of semantic redundancy. The phrase "happens to" adds little meaning to the sentence and can be removed without changing its overall meaning. Additionally, using both "appear" and "seem" to mean "look" or "give the impression of being" is unnecessary; choosing either verb would suffice. A clearer version could be "Jason appears to be sick."
0	Semantics	The sentence "What did you ask who saw?" is semantically incorrect because it lacks a clear subject and object. It's unclear what or who the speaker is asking about. A more complete version of the question might be "What did you ask [someone] when they saw [something]?"
1	Other Category	The sentence "We linguists love to argue" is grammatically correct. It consists of a noun phrase ("we linguists") followed by a verb phrase ("love to argue"). The subject-verb agreement is correct as well since the plural noun "linguists" matches the plural third-person present tense verb "love." Additionally, there is no incorrect word order or missing words, so the syntax is fine. Furthermore, all the words have their proper meanings, making the semantics clear. Finally, morphologically speaking, each word has its appropriate form, including the regular plural "-s" on "linguists," the first-person plural pronoun "we," and the base forms of the verbs "love" and "argue." Therefore, I would classify this example under the category of "Other Category" because it does not contain any errors related to syntax, semantics, or morphology.
0	Syntax	The sentence "He can will go" is grammatically incorrect because it uses two auxiliary verbs ("can" and "will") together without a main verb. In English grammar, we typically use only one auxiliary verb per clause. A corrected version could be "He can go" or "He will go", depending on what the intended meaning is.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a missing question mark at the end, making it syntactically incorrect. A proper question would be: "How fierce was the battle?" or "How fierce is the battle?" depending on context.
0	Syntax	The sentence contains a misplaced relative pronoun "which." A correct version could be: "Which king did you ask about; which city did he invade?" Here, two separate questions have been formed using semicolons or periods instead of commas around the relative pronouns, making for clearer syntax.
0	Syntax	The phrase "some disgruntled old pigs" contains a plural noun ("pigs") modified by multiple adjectives ("disgruntled," "old"). However, it is unclear what the subject and verb of the sentence are because there is no clear connection between "some disgruntled old pigs" and the rest of the sentence. To fix this issue, we could rephrase the sentence as follows: "It is those humans who love to eat some disgruntled old pigs." This version makes it clear that "humans" is the subject and "love" is the verb. Alternatively, we could use a relative clause to connect "some disgruntled old pigs" to the main clause: "Those are some disgruntled old pigs in those ditches that humans love to eat." Either way, it's important to ensure that each part of the sentence contributes clearly to the overall meaning.
0	Syntax	In this sentence, the subject ("that banana") is acting as the agent (doer) of the action, while the object ("the monkey") is being acted upon. However, in reality, it is the monkey who eats the banana, not the other way around. Therefore, the syntax of the sentence does not match its intended meaning, making it incorrect.
0	Syntax	The sentence "Burn them!" is a fragment because it lacks a main verb and a subject, making it syntactically incorrect. A complete sentence requires both a subject and a predicate (a verb). In order for this sentence to be grammatically correct, it would need additional context or information added to make it a full thought, such as "You should burn them."
1	Semantics	The sentence "It stinks that Aphrodite is omnipotent" is grammatically correct. The word "stinks" here is used figuratively to express dissatisfaction or displeasure towards something (in this case, the fact that Aphrodite is omnipotent). Therefore, there is no mistake in syntax, morphology, or any other category; it's just a matter of semantic interpretation.
1	Semantics	The sentence "Agamemnon seems to be a maniac" is grammatically correct. In terms of semantics, it can be understood and conveys a clear meaning. Here, 'Agamemnon' refers to a particular person (possibly from Greek mythology), and 'maniac' refers to someone who behaves in a wild or aggressive way. Therefore, the sentence suggests that Agamemnon exhibits such behavior.
1	Other Category	The sentence “Will Anson come to the party?” is grammatically correct. It has a subject (“Anson”), an auxiliary verb (“will”) indicating future tense, and an infinitive verb phrase (“come”) as its main components. Additionally, it forms a complete thought by asking whether or not the action (coming to the party) will be performed by the specified person (Anson). Therefore, there are no errors related to syntax, semantics, or morphology in this sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence "I wondered who Medea had poisoned" is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "I", the verb is "wondered", and the object is the clause "who Medea had poisoned". The word order follows standard English syntax rules for forming questions. Additionally, there are no morphological errors (e.g., incorrect tense or plurality) or semantic inconsistencies (e.g., illogical statements). Therefore, the sentence is syntactically correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence "I inquired when could we leave" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "I" is a pronoun used as the subject of the sentence. * "inquired" is a verb in past tense, indicating that the action has already occurred. * "when" is a conjunction introducing a subordinate clause. * "could we leave" is a question asked within the subordinate clause, using modal auxiliary verb "could." Therefore, there are no syntax errors in this sentence.
0	Syntax	The sentence is missing a direct object after the verb "kicked." A complete sentence requires a subject, verb, and object (SVO) structure for transitive verbs such as "kick." For example, "They kicked the ball" or "They kicked him." Without specifying who or what was kicked, the sentence is syntactically incomplete.
0	Syntax	In present tense sentences, we use base form of verb after a subject (e.g., "The monkey eats the banana"). However, in past tense sentences, we use third form of verb (e.g., "The monkey ate the banana" - past tense). Here, instead of using third form of verb 'ate', second form of verb 'is' has been used which makes it grammatically incorrect. Therefore, the correct version would be "The monkey ate the banana".
0	Syntax	The correct form of the sentence should be "I would like to **be able** to swim." or simply "I'd like to swim.", as the original sentence contains a grammatical error known as a verb tense inconsistency between "could" (past ability) and "swim" (present infinitive).
1	Syntax	The sentence "I kicked myself" is grammatically correct because it follows standard English syntax rules for subject-verb agreement (the subject "I" agrees with the verb "kicked") and word order (the subject comes before the verb). Additionally, the reflexive pronoun "myself" correctly refers back to the subject "I."
0	Syntax	In this sentence, "the bookcase" is the subject but "ran" is a verb that cannot be used for inanimate objects such as a bookcase because it implies action or movement by the subject on its own accord. This is a syntax error since the structure of the sentence violates grammatical rules regarding verbs and their subjects. A more appropriate word choice would have been "moved," although even then, we usually don't say a bookcase moved unless there was some external force causing it to move (e.g., someone pushed it).
1	Syntax	The sentence "I shaved myself" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a simple sentence in English (Subject-Verb-Object), where the subject "I" performs the action denoted by the verb "shaved," and the object "myself" refers back to the subject as the recipient of the action. Additionally, the past tense form of the verb ("shaved") agrees with the first-person singular subject ("I"). Therefore, there are no syntax errors in this sentence.
0	Morphology	The phrase "muscle bound" is incorrect because it lacks a determiner (e.g., "a", "an") before "muscle." A correct version would be "Anson became a muscle-bound person," or simply "Anson became muscular." In addition, "muscle-bound" typically refers to someone who has large muscles but limited flexibility due to excessive weight training.
