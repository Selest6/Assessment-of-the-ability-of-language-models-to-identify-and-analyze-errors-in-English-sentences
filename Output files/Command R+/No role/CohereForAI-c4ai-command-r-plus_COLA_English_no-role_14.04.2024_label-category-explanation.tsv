1	Syntax	The sentence follows the correct syntax and is grammatically correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically incorrect. The phrase "and Sally does too" is not grammatically correct and does not fit syntactically with the first part of the sentence. It should be rephrased to maintain correct syntax, such as "and Sally bothers them too."

0	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically incorrect. The correct sentence would be: "Fred talked about everything before Rusty talked about something." The word "did" after "Rusty" is redundant and disrupts the sentence structure.
1	Syntax	The sentence follows the correct syntax and word order for a simple sentence in English.
0	Semantics	The sentence is not correct because it doesn't make sense. The word "problem" typically refers to a difficult or complex issue, and it is not something that can "perceive" or understand. The sentence lacks clear and meaningful semantics.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct and does not contain any errors in syntax, semantics, or morphology.
0	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically incorrect because it is not possible for a person to elect themselves. The correct sentence would be "They elected me."
0	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically incorrect. The relative pronoun "which" is used to refer to a specific report, but the sentence lacks a clear antecedent for "which."

1	Syntax	The sentence follows the correct syntax and word order.
1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically correct and follows the subject-verb-object structure. The relative clause "which were whining" modifies the noun "cats" and provides additional information about them.

1	Syntax	The sentence follows a correct syntax structure.
0	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically incorrect. It seems like there might be a missing word or phrase that would complete the thought and make the sentence grammatically correct. As it stands, the sentence fragment lacks a subject and a complete verb, which are necessary for a sentence to be well-formed and grammatically correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically incorrect. The correct sentence would be: "He attributed the fire that destroyed most of my factory to a short circuit caused by an overloaded transducer."
1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically correct and follows the standard subject-verb-object structure. The phrase "regarded as being absurd" is a passive construction and is used correctly to describe the mayor's opinion of the proposal.
0	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically incorrect. The correct sentence would be: "I want Bill's departure to remain a secret." The original sentence uses the subordinate clause "that Bill left" as the object of the verb "want," which is not grammatically correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence "I know a man who Tom drives as drives" is syntactically incorrect. It seems like there might be a missing word or phrase that would clarify the structure and meaning of the sentence. As it stands, the phrase "as drives" at the end is not grammatically correct and does not fit syntactically with the rest of the sentence.
0	Syntax	The sentence "Drowning cats, which is against the law, are hard to rescue" is syntactically incorrect. The subject-verb agreement is incorrect: the singular verb "is" does not agree with the plural subject "cats." To correct the sentence, the verb should agree in number with the subject: "Drowning cats, which are against the law, are hard to rescue."
1	Syntax	The sentence follows a correct syntactic structure. It is a simple sentence with a subject ("Muriel"), a verb ("said"), and a complement ("nothing else than that she had been insulted"). The syntax is correct and follows the normal word order of English sentences.
1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically correct and follows the standard subject-verb structure. The pronoun "Himself" is used as the subject, and the verb "is understood" agrees with the singular, third-person subject.
1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically correct and follows the proper subject-verb agreement.
0	Syntax	The correct sentence would be "The proof that this set is recursive is difficult."
0	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically incorrect.

1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically correct and follows the proper subject-verb-object structure.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct and has a syntax error. It seems like two questions were combined into one, which makes the sentence confusing and incomplete.

0	Semantics	The use of the word "it" in the sentence is ambiguous and can refer to either "the place" or "Route 150," which makes the sentence semantically incorrect.
0	Syntax	The correct sentence would be: "Who is she trying to make up with now?" The original sentence uses the preposition "to" incorrectly. The phrase "make up with someone" is the correct phrasal verb to indicate reconciliation or improving a relationship.
0	Syntax	The correct sentence would be: "Word was gotten of a plot to negotiate an honorable end to the war in Vietnam." The word "word" was probably misspelled as "wind" in the given sentence.
0	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically incorrect. The correct sentence would be: "Mike talked about politics to my friends yesterday." The word "yesterday" should come after "my friends" to maintain the correct word order in the sentence.
0	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically incorrect. The phrase "It was expected" is a passive construction and should be followed by the agent who is performing the action of expecting using the preposition "by." However, the sentence already starts with "by the reporters," which makes the sentence structurally incorrect. To correct the sentence, one could rewrite it as "The reporters expected the principal to fire some teachers."
0	Semantics	The sentence is not correct because the pronoun "she" is incorrect when referring to Mike, who is typically a male name. To correct the sentence, "she" should be changed to "he." Here's the corrected version: "Which hat did Mike quip that he never wore?"
1	Semantics	The sentence is grammatically correct and makes sense semantically.
0	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically incorrect. The preposition "for" at the end of the sentence indicates that the relative pronoun "with" should come after it, not before. The correct sentence would be: "We donated wire with which the convicts could build cages."
0	Semantics	The sentence is semantically incorrect. The phrase "have some money" suggests possession or availability of money, which doesn't align with the negation in the sentence. To maintain semantic correctness, the sentence could be rephrased as "I don't have any money" or "I won't have money."
1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically correct and follows the standard subject-verb-object structure.
0	Syntax	The correct sentence would be: "I won't ask you to believe that he tried to force me to give him any money." The sentence as provided has an incorrect pronoun agreement. The pronoun "her" does not agree with the antecedent "he," which is masculine. To maintain agreement, the pronoun "her" should be replaced with "him."
1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically correct and follows the rules of English grammar.
1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically correct and follows the standard subject-verb-object structure.
1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically correct and follows the subject-verb-object pattern. The use of "that" introduces a subordinate clause, which is a valid construction in English grammar.

1	Syntax	The sentence follows the correct syntax and is grammatically correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically incorrect. The preposition "with" is followed by the relative pronoun "which," which is not the correct usage. The sentence should be structured as "Here's a knife for you to cut the onions with."
1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically correct and follows the normal subject-verb-object pattern.
1	Syntax	The sentence follows the correct syntax and is grammatically correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically incorrect due to the repetition of the conjunction "and". To correct the sentence, one of the conjunctions should be removed: "The younger woman might have been tall and the older one definitely was blond."
0	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically incorrect. It seems like there might be a missing word or incorrect word order in the second part of the sentence, which makes it hard to understand the intended meaning.
1	Syntax	The sentence follows the correct syntax and is grammatically correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically incorrect due to the incorrect use of prepositions and verb forms. A possible correction could be: "The socks are ready for you to put on as planned."

1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically correct and follows the proper subject-verb agreement and word order.
0	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically incorrect. The phrase "That robbery" at the end of the sentence is an incorrect noun phrase and does not fit syntactically with the rest of the sentence.
0	Syntax	The given sentence is syntactically incorrect. The conjunction "and" is being used to join two independent clauses, but the second clause "he wears socks" is not a complete sentence on its own. To correct the sentence, you could rewrite it as "Every student who wears socks is a swinger." This way, the clause "who wears socks" becomes a subordinate clause modifying "every student," and the sentence adheres to the grammatical rules of English.
1	Syntax	The sentence follows a correct syntactic structure and adheres to the grammatical rules of English. The sentence is a passive construction with the subject "That girl", the passive verb "was given", and the agent "by him". The object of the sentence is "my binoculars".

1	Syntax	The sentence follows a correct syntactic structure and adheres to the grammatical rules of English.
1	Syntax	The sentence follows a correct syntactic structure.
1	Semantics	The sentence is semantically correct and meaningful. It conveys the idea that the speaker is trying to recall the name of a person who had doubts or apprehensions about something. The use of "somebody" instead of a specific name indicates that the speaker is struggling to recall the person's identity.
0	Syntax	The correct sentence would be: "No writer, and no playwright, meet in Vienna." The verb "meet" should be in the singular form because it refers to each individual writer or playwright, not to the group as a whole.
0	Syntax	The correct sentence would be: "No writer, nor any playwright, meets in Vienna." The original sentence is incorrect because the verb "meet" should be singular to agree with the singular subject "no writer."

1	Semantics	The sentence is semantically correct and meaningful. It describes a situation where Sarah promised Catherine her old car but ultimately gave the car to her son, which is a coherent and understandable event.
0	Semantics	The sentence is semantically incorrect because the phrase "partway" doesn't make sense in this context. It seems like there is a missing word or the phrase "partway through" was intended to be used.
1	Syntax	The sentence follows a correct syntax and adheres to the rules of English grammar.
0	Semantics	The sentence is semantically incorrect because the prepositional phrase "with apples" suggests that the farmer used apples to dump the cart, which doesn't make sense in this context.

1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct and does not require any corrections.
1	Semantics	The sentence is semantically correct. The word "bread" refers to a food item that is often cut, and the word "easily" indicates that it can be cut with minimal effort or force. Thus, the sentence is semantically valid and meaningful.
0	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically incorrect. The phrase "on the finger" is not appropriate in this context and makes the sentence confusing. The correct preposition to use in this case would be "her" or "his" to indicate whose finger was broken, for example, "Janet broke Bill his finger."

1	Syntax	The sentence follows the correct syntax and word order for a simple English sentence.
0	Morphology	The correct sentence would be "Much information was provided." This is because "much" is used with non-countable nouns like "information."

1	Syntax	The sentence follows a correct syntactic structure and adheres to the grammar rules of the English language.
1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically correct and follows the standard subject-verb-object structure.
1	Semantics	The sentence is semantically correct. It conveys a meaningful idea that the speaker has seen or observed that gas can explode. The sentence uses the verb "saw" to indicate a past action of seeing or observing, and the noun "gas" refers to a substance that is known to be flammable and can explode under certain conditions. The sentence is structured correctly, and the use of "that" after "saw" is appropriate to introduce the object of the seeing action, which is "gas."
1	Semantics	The sentence is semantically correct and meaningful. The pronoun "her" is used correctly to refer to a female person, and the verb "washed" is appropriate in this context.

0	Morphology	The verb "are" is missing between "monkeys" and "proud", which makes the sentence grammatically incorrect.
0	Semantics	The sentence is not correct because it is semantically incomplete. The word "very" needs to be followed by an adjective or an adverb to make sense and complete the thought. For example, you could say "John sounded very tired" or "John sounded very loudly." As it stands, the sentence fragment lacks a complete meaning, and thus, it is incorrect.
1	Syntax	The sentence follows a clear subject-verb structure and is syntactically correct.
0	Semantics	The sentence is semantically incorrect. The prepositional phrase "on the table" suggests that John bought the book while he was on a table, which doesn't make sense in this context.

1	Syntax	The sentence follows the correct syntax and has a clear structure with a subject ("The committee"), a verb ("will study"), and an object ("the feasibility of setting up a national computer network").
0	Semantics	The sentence is semantically incorrect because the verb "make" is used to force or cause someone to do something. It is not typically used to describe causing someone to exhibit a certain behavior, especially not a behavior as subjective as rudeness. A possible correction could be: "We caused them to be rude."
1	Syntax	The sentence follows a correct syntax structure, with a clear subject ("Judy"), verb ("threw"), and object ("the pamphlet"). The sentence also includes a prepositional phrase ("after reading the pamphlet") that modifies the verb and provides additional information about the sequence of events.

0	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically incorrect. It seems like the sentence is trying to convey that Tom said he would eat a raw eggplant, but Bill actually ate it.

1	Syntax	The sentence follows a correct syntax and is grammatically correct.
0	Morphology	The pronoun "himself" is incorrect in this sentence because it is a reflexive pronoun that refers back to the subject "John's mother." Reflexive pronouns are used when the subject and the object of a sentence are the same entity, but in this case, "John's mother" is not referring to the same person as "himself." The correct pronoun should be "herself" because it agrees in gender and number with the antecedent "John's mother."

1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct and follows the correct syntax, semantics, and morphology.
0	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically incorrect. It seems like there is a mistake in the structure of the sentence, specifically with the use of "so" and "Mary." The sentence might be corrected as "I saw Bill while you did so, Mary," or "I saw Bill while you, Mary, did so," for the syntax to be correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically incorrect. It seems like there is a subject missing after "What." Also, the verb "did" should probably be in the past tense, "did," to agree with the past tense of "give." The sentence might be corrected as: "What Bill did was give Mary a book."

0	Morphology	The word "demonized" is not a verb, and even if it were, it would not fit grammatically in this sentence.
1	Syntax	The sentence follows a correct syntactic structure. The use of the double negative ("not" and "might") is correct in this context and does not change the meaning of the sentence.

1	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically correct and follows the standard subject-verb-object structure.

1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct and does not contain any errors in syntax, semantics, or morphology.
0	Syntax	The sentence uses too many verb phrases that make it awkward and unnatural. A more concise and correct version would be: "Jason appears to be sick."
