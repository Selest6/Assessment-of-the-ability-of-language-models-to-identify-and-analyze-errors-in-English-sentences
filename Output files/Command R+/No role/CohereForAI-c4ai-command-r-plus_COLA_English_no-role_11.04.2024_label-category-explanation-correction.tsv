The sentence is already correct.
0	Morphology	The word "lots" is an adjective and should be used with a verb that requires an adjective complement, such as "be." In this sentence, the verb "was" requires an adverbial complement, so the correct word to use would be "much" instead of "lots."	John was much more obnoxious than Fred.

0	Syntax	The sentence is ungrammatical because it lacks a subject. In this case, the subject is "What," but it is not what did the action of filling the bottle; instead, it is the water. So, the sentence should start with "What the water did..." and then continue with a verb phrase that describes the action performed by the water.	What the water did to the whole bottle was fill it up.

Joe's neuroses bother his patrons, and so does Sally.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not correct syntactically. The correct phrase would be "and which book Lilly read for him."	I know which book José didn't read for class, and which book Lilly read for him.

0	Syntax	The sentence is not correct because of the incorrect use of the relative pronoun "which." Relative pronouns should be used to refer to a specific person or thing and should have an explicit antecedent. In this sentence, the antecedent for "which" is unclear, leading to ambiguity.	I know which book Mag read and which book Bob said you hadn't read.
0	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically incorrect due to the ambiguous and confusing use of pronouns and verb tenses. It is not clear who the pronoun "that" refers to, and the verb "report" seems to be missing a noun or noun phrase as its object.	The sentence needs revision for clarity: "I know which book Mag read and which book Bob read my report on, namely the one you hadn't [read/seen]."

0	Syntax	The sentence is not correct syntactically. The correct structure would be to use either "after Mary talked about him" or "after Mary had talked about him." The use of "did talk" is not appropriate in this context.	Rusty talked about himself only after Mary talked about him.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not correct syntactically because of the incorrect use of the verb form "did talk". When using "did" as an auxiliary verb for forming the past tense, the base form of the main verb ("talk") should be used, without the "-ed" ending.

0	Syntax	The sentence is not correct syntactically. The correct phrase should be: "I want that Bill's leaving remains a secret." The original sentence is an example of a sentence fragment, where a group of words looks like a complete sentence but does not express a complete thought.	I want that Bill's leaving remains a secret.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not correct syntactically. It seems like there is a mistake in the structure of the sentence, particularly in the use of the verb "drives" twice, which makes it confusing to understand.	I know a man whom Tom drives just as he drives.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not correct syntactically. The subject-verb agreement is incorrect. The correct verb form should be "are drowned" instead of "is drowned" to agree with the plural subject "cats."	Drowning cats, which is against the law, are hard to rescue.
1	Semantics	The sentence is semantically correct and makes sense contextually.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Semantics	The sentence is semantically incorrect because the reflexive pronoun "himself" cannot be used as the subject of a sentence.

1	Syntax	The sentence is already syntactically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The correct article "The" is "A" because the word "proof" is uncountable. Also, the correct verb form of "to be" in this sentence is "being" instead of "is."	A proof of this set being difficult is recursive.

I live at the place where Route 150 crosses the River, and my dad lives at the place where Route 150 crosses the Hudson River. (Assuming that "the River" and "the Hudson River" are two different rivers.)
0	Semantics	The sentence is semantically incorrect because the use of "it" in the sentence is ambiguous and can refer to either "the place" or "the Hudson River." To avoid confusion, it is better to use a more specific pronoun or rephrase the sentence for clarity.	I live at the place where Route 150 crosses the Hudson River, and my dad lives there too.
0	Semantics	The sentence is not correct because the use of "make up to" is not appropriate in this context. It seems that the intended meaning is to ask about the person that she is trying to please or get closer to.	Who is she trying to please now? or Who is she trying to get close to now?
0	Semantics	The sentence is not correct because the phrase "wind was gotten" does not make sense in this context. It seems like there might be a mistake or confusion with the use of the word "wind." Perhaps, the intended word could be "word" or "news."	Word was gotten of a plot to negotiate an honorable end to the war in Vietnam.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not correct syntactically because the preposition "to" is missing an object. In English, prepositions are followed by nouns, pronouns, or noun phrases, but in this sentence, the preposition "to" is not followed by a complete noun phrase.	Mike talked about politics yesterday to my friends.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not correct syntactically. The phrase "It was expected" is a passive construction and requires a by-phrase to specify the agent. However, the by-phrase "by the reporters" is already present in the sentence, resulting in a redundant and awkward phrase.	The reporters expected the principal to fire some teachers.
0	Semantics	The sentence is not correct because of the use of the pronoun "she" to refer to Mike. The pronoun "she" is typically used to refer to a female, while "Mike" is typically used as a male name. To correct the sentence, you could change the pronoun "she" to "he" or use a gender-neutral pronoun such as "they."	The sentence contains a semantic error and cannot be corrected without additional context.
1	Semantics	The sentence is correct and does not require any changes.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Semantics	The sentence is not correct because the phrase "for the convicts to build cages with" suggests that the purpose of donating wire was for the convicts to use it to build cages. However, the use of the preposition "for" at the end of the sentence makes it sound like the convicts are being asked to build cages as a favor or a task, which is not the intended meaning.	We donated wire to the convicts for building cages.
0	Semantics	The sentence is semantically incorrect because the phrase "have some money" implies possession or availability of money, which doesn't align with the intended meaning of not having money.	The sentence is already correct.

0	Syntax	The sentence is not correct syntactically because of the wrong word order. The word "which" should be followed by a subject and a verb, but in this sentence, there is only a verb ("knows") without a clear subject.	It is not known by everybody that Fluffy is sick.
1	Semantics	The sentence is semantically correct and makes sense in context. The phrase "quite a doctor" is an idiomatic expression meaning Maxwell is a capable or impressive doctor.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence is incorrect because of the incorrect use of the coordinating conjunction "and". When a coordinating conjunction connects two independent clauses, a comma should be placed before it.	The younger woman might have been tall, and the older one definitely was blond.
