0	The sentence is incorrect because the verb "did" requires a verb in the infinitive form without the particle "to" as its complement.	What the water did to the bottle was to fill it.
0	The sentence is incorrect because the verb "fill" should be conjugated as "filled" to agree with the subject "water."	What the water did to the whole bottle was fill fill it.
0	This sentence is grammatically incorrect. The use of the word "free" at the end of the sentence is incorrect and doesn't make sense in this context. It seems like there might be a missing word or the sentence is not structured correctly.	The tank leaked the fluid freely.
0	The sentence is incorrect because the verb "lay" is used incorrectly in this context. The correct verb to use here would be "laid," which is the past tense of "to lay."	John laid the ball in the box.
1	The sentence is already grammatically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is already correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The correct conjunction to use in this sentence is "while" instead of "even though" as it is a contrast error. The sentence also has a punctuation error, a comma is needed after "probably." Additionally, there is a subject-verb disagreement as the verb "consider" should be followed by a noun or a pronoun, not a clause.	Most people probably consider, while the courts didn't actually find, Klaus guilty of murder.
0	The sentence is not correct because the use of the adverb "beautifully" is incorrect in this context. It should be used to describe the manner in which Mary plays the violin, but the sentence structure does not allow for this interpretation.	Mary plays the violin beautifully.
0	The sentence is not correct. The word "immediately" is incorrect in this context, as it contradicts the probability expressed by "probably."	Clearly, John will probably learn French perfectly.
0	The sentence is not correct because it contains a prepositional phrase ("to Bill") that modifies the verb "gave." In this case, the prepositional phrase should be placed after the direct object "a book" to maintain the correct word order in the sentence.	Sue gave a book to Bill.

0	The sentence is not correct because of the incorrect use of "also." When using "also," the verb that follows should be in the infinitive form.	John wants to read Fred's story, and I also want to read it.
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect. The correct phrase would be "We couldn't decide whom to invite." Here, "whom" is the objective case of the pronoun "who" and is used as the object of a preposition or verb.	We wanted to invite someone, but we couldn't decide whom to.
1	The sentence is already grammatically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	This sentence is incorrect and needs to be rewritten for clarity. As it stands, it suggests that Mary claimed something about Holly eating cabbage, but the structure is awkward and unclear.	Mary claimed that Holly shouldn't eat cabbage.
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect. The phrase "came to be" is not used correctly in this context and is not typically used to mean "became." Additionally, the use of "and I also" is redundant and makes the sentence wordy.	Mary became a bartender, and so did I.
1	The sentence is already correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence is incorrect because the word "neuroses" is plural, but the verb "bother" is singular. To make the sentence grammatically correct, the verb "bother" should be changed to "botheres".	Joe's neuroses bother his patrons, and Sally does too.

0	The sentence is not correct because of the incorrect use of pronouns. The phrase "won't do it" is not grammatically consistent with the rest of the sentence.	This is the book that Bob reviewed, and this is the one that Fred won't review.
0	The sentence is not correct because of the incorrect use of the pronoun "that." In this context, the relative pronoun "that" should be used to refer to the book, not the person.	I know which book Mag read, and which book Bob said that you hadn't read.
0	The sentence is not correct because of the incorrect use of pronouns and the lack of parallelism. The sentence mixes the use of "which" and "that" as relative pronouns, which is incorrect. Also, the phrase "my report that you hadn't" is not parallel in structure with the preceding phrase "which book Mag read" and "which book Bob read."	I know which book Mag read and which book Bob read; it was my report that you hadn't.
0	The correct sentence should be "I'm sure I would like him to eat fruit more than cookies." The original sentence uses the word "would" twice, which is incorrect and sounds awkward.	I'm sure I would like him to eat fruit more than cookies.
0	The correct form of the sentence should be "Rusty talked about himself only after Mary had talked about him." The correct auxiliary verb to use in this case is "had talked" because it refers to an action that happened before another past action. The word "did" is not appropriate in this context.	Rusty talked about himself only after Mary had talked about him.
0	The sentence is not correct because the verb tense and the word order in the second clause are incorrect. In a sentence with two clauses, the verb in the second clause should come before the subject.	Fred talked about everything before Rusty talked about something.
1	The sentence is already correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	This sentence is not correct grammatically. The subject ("problem") and the verb ("perceives") do not agree in number. The correct verb form for a singular subject like "problem" should be "perceives" instead of "perceive."	The problem is easily perceived.
1	The sentence is already correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence is incorrect because the verb "elected" is not used correctly. The correct verb form to use here is "elect" since it is a reflexive verb and the sentence is in the first person plural ("we").	We elected myself.
0	The sentence is not correct because the use of "which" is incorrect. The correct word to use here should be "whom" because the object of the prepositional phrase "that John was incompetent" is the pronoun "who," and "whom" is the objective case of "who."	Whom did he submit the report that John was incompetent?
1	The sentence is already correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence is incorrect because the relative pronoun "which" is used incorrectly here. It should be replaced with "that." Additionally, the verb "let" needs to be followed by a noun or pronoun, so the word "them" is needed after "cats."	He let the cats that were whining out.
1	The sentence is already correct.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is already correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	This sentence is grammatically incorrect. It seems to be missing a word or has a word out of place, as the phrase "that John had lied" seems unfinished or incomplete.	A proof that the claim had been made was given: John had lied.
0	This sentence is incorrect and needs to be rewritten for better grammar and clarity. The use of "attributed" is incorrect in this context, and the sentence structure is awkward.	He attributed the fire that destroyed most of my factory to a short circuit caused by an overloaded transducer.
0	This sentence is not correct grammatically. The phrase "regarded as" should be followed by a noun or a noun phrase, but in this sentence, it is followed by a verb phrase ("being absurd").	The mayor regarded the proposal to build a sidewalk from Dartmouth to Smith as being absurd.
0	The correct sentence should be "I want that Bill's leaving remain a secret." The original sentence is incorrect because the verb "left" is not in the correct form.	I want that Bill's leaving remain a secret.
0	The sentence is not correct grammatically. The use of the relative pronoun "who" is incorrect in this context, and the sentence lacks a clear subject and verb agreement.	I know a man whom Tom drives just as (he) drives.
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect. The phrase "drowning cats" is a noun phrase that serves as the subject of the sentence, and it is being described as "against the law." However, the present participle phrase "drowning cats" indicates that the cats are currently in the act of drowning, which doesn't make sense in the context of the sentence.	Rescuing drowning cats, which is against the law, is hard.
1	The sentence is already correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect. The reflexive pronoun "himself" should only be used when the subject and the object of a sentence are the same person. In this sentence, "Rutherford" is the subject and "himself" is the object, which are different people.	Rutherford understands himself.
1	The sentence is already correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The correct article to use here is 'of' instead of 'this'. The word 'this' is a determiner that is used to identify a specific person or object that is close in proximity, either physically or in time, to the speaker. In this case, the correct article 'of' is used to indicate possession or association.	The proof of this set being recursive is difficult.
0	The sentence is not correct because the word "which" is incorrectly used. It should be "while" instead of "which" as it is describing an action that Henry is doing simultaneously.	The madrigals while Henry plays the lute and sings sound lousy.

1	The sentence is already correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence has incorrect placement of apostrophes and does not follow the correct subject-verb agreement.	Which boys' employer did we elect guardian president?
0	The sentence is not correct because the word "sane" is an adjective and needs a copula (a form of the verb "to be") before it.	How sane is Peter?
0	This sentence is incorrect because of the use of the word "too" at the end. The word "too" is used to indicate that something is also true or also the case, but in this sentence, it is not needed because the fact that the dad also lives at the place where Route 150 crosses the Hudson River is already implied by the previous phrase "my dad lives at the place."	I live at the place where Route 150 crosses the River and my dad lives there too.
0	This sentence is incorrect because the pronoun "it" is ambiguous and does not clearly refer to a specific noun.	I live at the place where Route 150 crosses the Hudson River and my dad lives there too.
0	The correct preposition to use in this sentence is "with," not "to." The phrase "make up with someone" means to reconcile or restore a relationship.	Who is she trying to make up with now?
0	The verb "get" is used incorrectly in this sentence. A correct phrase could be "was aware of". Also, the article "a" before "plot" is incorrect and should be replaced with "of".	Wind was aware of a plot to negotiate an honorable end to the Vietnam War.
0	The sentence is not correct because the preposition "to" is incorrect in this context. The preposition "to" is typically used when the object of the preposition is a person or a group of people, and it often indicates movement or direction toward someone. In this sentence, "my friends" is the object of the preposition, but the context does not involve movement or direction toward them. Instead, it describes Mike talking about politics to them, which is a static situation.	Mike talked about politics with my friends yesterday.
0	This sentence is not correct because the use of the passive voice makes it awkward and unnatural.	The reporters expected that the principal would fire some teachers.
0	The sentence is not correct because the verb "quip" requires a subject that is typically a person, but "Mike" is a proper noun referring to a person's name and should be used as the subject.	Which hat did Mike never wear, quipping?
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct. It seems like it might be missing a word or has an incorrect word order.	Which girl did Mike quip that never wore this hat?
0	This sentence is incorrect because the preposition "for" should be followed by a gerund form of the verb, which in this case would be "building".	We donated wire for the convicts to build cages with.
0	This sentence is incorrect because the verb "have" should be followed by a definite article ("the") or a possessive adjective ("my," "your," etc.) when used in this context.	I won't have any money.
1	The sentence is already correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence is incorrect because the pronouns "I," "he," and "her" are confusing and unclear. It is not clear who is trying to force whom to give money to whom.	I won't ask you to believe that he tried to force me to give him some money.
1	The sentence is already correct.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is already correct.	The sentence is already correct.

John was worried that the fuzz wanted him, but Mary wasn't worried that the fuzz wanted her.
0	The sentence is not correct because it uses two different verb tenses ("will work" and "will be working") in the same sentence, which makes it grammatically inconsistent and awkward to read.	I'll work on it if Sam is working on it.
1	The sentence is already correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence is incorrect because the prepositions "with" and "for" should not be used together in this context.	Here's a knife for you to cut up the onions with.
0	This sentence is a comma splice. It contains two independent clauses ("Fluffy is sick" and "which not everybody knows") that are incorrectly joined by a comma.	Fluffy is sick, but not everybody knows that.
1	The sentence is already correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	This sentence is incorrect due to the repetition of the conjunction "and".	The younger woman might have been tall, and the older one definitely was blond.
0	This sentence has a few issues. Firstly, the comma after "tall" is incorrect and should be replaced with a conjunction or omitted. Secondly, "blond" should be "blonde" when used as a noun or adjective describing a female. Finally, there is a missing article before "blond/blonde" in the phrase "definitely is blond."	Sally is tall and may be blonde, and Sheila is short and definitely is blonde.
1	The sentence is already correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	This sentence is incorrect and has some issues with word choice and redundancy.	The socks are ready for you to put on.

0	This sentence is incorrect and needs to be rewritten to make sense grammatically. It seems like the intention is to say that the speaker's mother is easy to please, and this action or trait somehow involves the father as well. However, the current structure doesn't convey that clearly.	My mother is easy to please; my father, too.
1	The sentence is already correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence is a fragment and does not express a complete thought. It seems like the speaker may be trying to say that it is terrible that the cops spoke to the janitor about the robbery yesterday, but the sentence is not structured correctly to convey this meaning.	It is terrible that the cops spoke to the janitor about that robbery yesterday.
0	The given sentence is not grammatically correct. It contains a comma splice, which is a sentence containing two independent clauses that are incorrectly joined only by a comma. To correct this, we can use a conjunctive adverb or rephrase the sentence.	Every student who wears socks is a swinger.
0	The sentence is not correct because the word "my" is incorrect in this context. The sentence suggests that the binoculars belong to the person speaking, but the structure of the sentence is not correct to convey this ownership.	That girl was given my binoculars by me.
1	The sentence is already correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect. The correct phrase would be "Nobody who hates eating anything should work in a delicatessen." Here, "eat" is an incorrect verb form in the context of this sentence.	Nobody who hates eating anything should work in a delicatessen.
0	The correct relative pronoun to use in this sentence is "whoever" because it is referring to people in general and is the subject of the clause "whoever buys anything on credit."	Everybody around here who ever buys anything on credit talks in his sleep.
0	This sentence is incorrect. The correct phrase is "I can't remember somebody's name."	I can't remember somebody's name.
0	The sentence is incorrect because of the subject-verb agreement issue. When compound subjects are joined by "and," they are treated as plural, so the correct verb form to use is "meet."	No writer, and no playwright, meet in Vienna.
0	The sentence is incorrect because of the incorrect use of the conjunctive adverb "nor." When using "nor," the sentence structure should be: "Neither [noun phrase] nor [noun phrase] [verb]." In the given sentence, the structure is not consistent with this pattern.	No writer nor any playwright meets in Vienna.
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect. It seems like a confusion between "any student" and "any other student."	That you will marry any other student is not certain.
0	This sentence is incorrect and ambiguous.

0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect. The word "information" is uncountable in English and should be used with the singular form of verbs and adjectives. Also, the verb "was" is incorrect and should be changed to "were" to agree with the plural subject "many."	Much information was provided.
0	The word "advice" is uncountable in standard English, so it should be used with singular verb forms and determiners.	John offers a lot of advice.
1	The sentence is already correct.	The cake that Jones got was more delicious than the one that Smith got.
0	The sentence is incorrect because the phrase "to eat" is an infinitive phrase that is being used as a direct object after the verb "recommend." In this case, the infinitive phrase should be used in its base form, without the "to."	We recommend eating less cake and pastry.
0	The sentence is incorrect because it is missing an article before the word "gas." In English, we need to use an article (a, an, or the) before a singular noun when it is not specifically identified or when it is being referred to in a general sense.	I saw that a gas can explode.
0	The sentence is not correct because the pronoun "her" needs to be replaced with a noun or a clearer pronoun to avoid ambiguity.	He washed his cat.
0	The sentence is not correct because it does not follow the standard English sentence structure. It seems to be an imperative command but the correct imperative form of the verb "wash" in the second person is "Wash yourself."	Wash yourself!
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect. It seems to be incomplete as there is no clear subject or verb, and the phrase "no in" doesn't make sense in this context.	The sentence needs more context or information to make sense. It could be corrected by adding more details, such as: "They have no intention of going to the party."
0	The correct sentence should be "Some of my jobs are in jeopardy." The word "of" is missing after "Some."	Some of my jobs are in jeopardy.
0	This sentence is incorrect because the word "that" should be placed before "met," not after it. Also, the sentence structure is awkward and could be improved for clarity.	It was the policeman that met several young students in the park last night.
0	This sentence is not correct grammatically. It seems to be missing a subject or a verb that would complete the thought.	Did the policeman meet someone in the park?
1	The sentence is already correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect because the subject "monkeys" is plural, but the verb "is" is singular. In English, the verb must agree with the subject in number.	The monkeys are proud of their leader.
0	This sentence is incomplete and, therefore, incorrect. It seems that an adjective or an adverb is missing after the word "very."	John sounded very happy.
1	The sentence is already correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	This sentence is ambiguous and potentially misleading. It can be interpreted in two ways: either John bought a book that was on the table, or John bought a book about the table (a book that discusses the topic of tables). To make the sentence clear, it should be rewritten to specify the intended meaning.	To clarify the sentence, we can rewrite it as one of the following options: 1. John bought the book that was on the table. (If the book being on the table is important information.) 2. John bought a book about tables while he was on the table. (If the location of John is important information.) 3. John, who was on the table, bought a book. (If both the location of John and the book being purchased are important information.) These sentences provide additional context and disambiguate the original sentence, making the intended meaning clear to the reader.

0	This sentence is grammatically incorrect. It seems to be missing a word or context to make sense. The word "depends" is not typically used this way and needs a preposition or an object to make the sentence complete and meaningful.

0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect. It seems to be missing a word or has the wrong word order, making it difficult to understand the intended meaning.	That Bill nominated Fred shows that Fred was unpopular.
0	The sentence is not correct because the acronym "FTA" should be written in full form for clarity, especially if the audience may not be familiar with the term.	They were taking a hard look at a possible free trade agreement (FTA).
0	The preposition "against" is not the right choice for this sentence. It doesn't make sense to say that John paid "against" the book.	John paid me for the book.

1	The sentence is already correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "reads" is not correct here because it is singular and the subject "students" is plural. To make the verb agree with the subject, the verb should be plural: "read".	Students studying English read Conrad's Heart of Darkness while at university.

1	The sentence is already correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect because the verb "failed" should agree with the plural subject "Neither of the students." In this case, the correct verb form would be "have failed."	Neither of the students have failed.
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect because the word "some" should be followed by a quantifiable noun or a noun phrase. In this case, "water" is a non-count noun that cannot be used with "some."	I drank some water.
0	The correct article to use here would be 'a' since the word 'hair' is a countable noun in singular form.	It is a golden hair.
1	The sentence is already correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence is illogical and nonsensical as a dog trying to bite itself does not indicate ferocity but rather a potential health or behavioral issue.	That dog is behaving strangely; it even tried to bite itself.
0	The sentence is incorrect because the reflexive pronoun "yourself" should not be used as the object of a sentence when the subject is someone else.	He washed himself.
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect. It seems like the intention is to say that John easily pleases Kim, but the current structure is not correct.	John easily pleases Kim.
0	This sentence is incomplete and does not convey a complete thought. It seems like there might be a missing word or phrase after "intelligent."	The sentence needs more context to be corrected. It could be corrected as: "There seemed to be an intelligent idea behind the project."
1	The sentence is already correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	This sentence is incorrect and does not make sense as it stands. It seems there is a confusion or mistake in the choice of words, particularly with the word "fountain."	We need more context to correct this sentence. It might be corrected to: "We believed John to be the statue of a fountain in the park." or "We believed John to have knowledge like a fountain in the park." depending on the intended meaning.

0	This sentence is not correct grammatically. The verb "be" should agree with the plural noun "sheep," so the correct phrase would be "There are believed to be sheep in the park."	There are believed to be sheep in the park.
0	This sentence is incorrect because it uses the wrong verb form and has a confusing structure. In English, the verb "hope" is followed by either a verb in the infinitive form (without "to") or a noun/noun phrase.	I hope to study in France.
1	The sentence is already correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence is not correct because the verb "rain" is used incorrectly in this context. The verb "rain" is typically used as a noun or as a meteorological term to refer to precipitation. In this sentence, it seems that the verb "rain" is intended to describe a future action or event, which does not make sense.	This sentence cannot be corrected by simply changing the word usage; additional context or rephrasing is necessary. For example, you might want to say, "It will rain tomorrow, according to John." or "John predicts rain for tomorrow."
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect. The correct phrase should be "We expect it to rain." or "We expect that it will rain."	We expect it to rain.
1	The sentence is already correct.	The sentence is already correct.

0	This sentence is not correct grammatically. The subject ("A pound") is being acted upon by the verb ("was weighed"), so it is in the passive voice. To fix this, the sentence should be rewritten in the active voice.	The book weighed a pound.
0	The correct sentence should be: "Whom do you think Tom saw?" Here, "whom" is the objective case of the pronoun "who" and is used as the object of a verb or preposition. In this sentence, it is the object of the verb "saw."	Whom do you think Tom saw?
1	The sentence is already correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	This sentence is incorrect because of the incorrect use of the pronoun "her." The correct sentence would use "whom" instead of "her" as the object of the preposition "for."	Fed knows which politician for whom to vote.

1	The sentence is already correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	This sentence is grammatically incorrect. The phrase "hard to find" is used to describe something that is difficult to locate or obtain, but it is not typically used to describe a person in this context. The correct phrase would be "hard to come by."	That kind of person is hard to come by.

0	The correct sentence should be: "I'm sure we even got these tickets." The word "even" doesn't fit well in this context and sounds awkward.	I'm sure we got these tickets!
0	The correct sentence should be: "I'm not even sure we got these tickets!" The word "not" is missing, which changes the meaning of the sentence.	I'm not even sure we got these tickets!
0	The correct form of the word in the context provided is "guerrillas," not "guerillas." "Guerrilla" refers to a member of a small, independent group taking part in irregular fighting, typically against larger forces.	It's not because I have any sympathy for urban guerrillas that I helped him.
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect due to the incorrect use of the relative pronoun "that." In this sentence, the relative pronoun should be "what" instead of "that" because it refers to the content of the speech.	It isn't because Sue said anything bad about me what I'm angry.
0	This sentence is a comma splice, which is a sentence that contains two independent clauses that are incorrectly joined by a comma. In this case, the independent clauses are "That he was hungry" and "John whined." To correct this sentence, a conjunction or a semicolon should be used to join the two clauses.	That he was hungry, John complained loudly; he whined.
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect. It seems to be missing a subject and has an incorrect word order.	I gave Mary a book after the party.
0	This sentence is not correct. The use of "as for" is not appropriate in this context and should be removed.	Because she's so pleasant, I really like Mary.
0	The correct form should be "those who criticize Carter". The relative pronoun "that" is used to refer to things, and the relative pronoun "who" is used to refer to people.	Though he may hate those who criticize Carter, it doesn't matter.
0	The sentence is not correct grammatically. It seems like it is trying to convey that John would not be happy without a job, but the correct construction for this idea is "Without a job, John would not be happy."	Without a job, John would not be happy.
1	The sentence is already correct.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is already correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The correct sentence should be "I don't want any trouble." as the subject "I" is the one performing the action of not wanting any trouble, so it should come first in the sentence for proper subject-verb-object order.	I don't want any trouble.
1	The sentence is already correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The correct phrase should be "as many as." The sentence also needs to agree with the subject "some."	Some of them made as many as 20 errors.
0	The sentence is incorrect because the reflexive pronoun "himself" does not agree in gender with the antecedent "Sally," which is typically a female name.	Sally kissed herself.

0	This sentence is grammatically incorrect. It seems like there is a missing noun or noun phrase after "poems". Additionally, the use of "and" followed by "from" is awkward and does not make sense in this context.	The book of poems and short stories from Blackwell takes a very long time to read.
0	The sentence is incorrect because the article "a" is missing before the noun "red cover." In English, we use the indefinite article "a" when referring to a non-specific noun.	The one with a red cover takes a very long time to read.
1	The sentence is already correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect. It seems like there is a missing article before the word "building."	The building's roof is leaking.

1	The sentence is already correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence is a conditional sentence that expresses a hypothetical situation and its consequence. However, the correct structure for this type of sentence would be: "If I were a rich man, I would buy a diamond ring." The subjunctive mood ("were") is used in the "if" clause of hypothetical situations that are contrary to fact (since the speaker is not actually a rich man), and "would" is the correct auxiliary verb to use with "if I were."	If I were a rich man, I would buy a diamond ring.
1	The sentence is already correct. It uses the subjunctive mood to express a hypothetical situation, and the verb form "were" is appropriate in this context.	The sentence is already correct.

1	The sentence is already correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence is incorrect because the reflexive pronoun "himself" is used incorrectly. A reflexive pronoun should refer back to the subject of the sentence, but in this case, "himself" refers to John instead of Mary.	John thinks that Mary loves herself.

0	The sentence is not correct because it uses the definite article "any" incorrectly. In this context, the correct article to use would be "a."	Any owl hunts mice.

0	This sentence is incorrect and needs to be rewritten to adhere to grammatical standards. The issue lies in the ambiguous pronoun reference of "which." To maintain clarity, it would be better to use "that" instead of "which."	The kennel that Mary made and Fido sleeps in has been stolen.
0	This sentence is not correct grammatically. It seems to be missing a subject for the verb "did." However, the sentence structure is still unclear and could benefit from rewording for better clarity.	Tom said he would, and Bill actually ate a raw eggplant.

0	This sentence is not correct because it contains a grammatical error. The phrase "the idea" is a noun phrase that functions as the subject of the sentence, but it is not the subject of the verb "dismayed." This is known as a "dangling modifier." To correct the sentence, we need to ensure that the subject of the sentence performs the action denoted by the verb.	The idea of the Dome being dull dismayed the Prime Minister.

0	The correct word is "whisky" when used as a standalone noun in British English, or "whiskey" when used as an adjective or in proper nouns like "Irish Whiskey".

0	The verb form should be in the -ing form to be used after "go".	She goes and buys some whiskey.

0	The sentence is not correct because it is not in the passive voice. In the passive voice, the object of the action becomes the subject of the sentence, and the subject of the active sentence (the agent) becomes the optional agent introduced by the preposition "by." In this case, the object of the action ("the paper") should be the subject of the sentence, and the agent ("Mary") should be introduced by the preposition "by."	The paper is cut by Mary.

0	The provided sentence is a fragment and is not a complete sentence as it does not express a complete thought. A sentence should have at least a subject and a verb to be considered complete.	John asked a question.
0	The use of "even" in this sentence is incorrect. It should be used to indicate that something unexpected or unlikely happened, or to emphasize that everyone or everything was included. In this case, seeing a student is not unexpected, so "even" is not needed here.	I saw the student.
0	The sentence is not correct because it is missing a word that would clarify the subject of the sentence.	John whispered that Mary had left.
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect. The correct phrase should be "Mary wonders if Bill will come." The word "if" is used to introduce a question or a statement expressing doubt or uncertainty.	Mary wonders if Bill will come.

Medea tried to get the nurse to poison her children.
0	The correct sentence should be "I felt that I knew you." Here, the verb "know" should be in the past tense ("knew") to agree with the past tense of the verb "felt."	I felt that I knew you.

There are some disgruntled old pigs in those ditches, which humans love to eat.
