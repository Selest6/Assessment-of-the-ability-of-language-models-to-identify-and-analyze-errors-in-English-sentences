0	The sentence is not grammatically correct. It should be "the more John **eats**," as "eat" is the singular present tense form of the verb and does not agree with the plural subject "the more."
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct. It is a run-on sentence, which means it contains two independent clauses that are not correctly joined. To fix this, we can use a semicolon or a conjunction.

0	The sentence is not grammatically correct. It seems to be missing some context or information that would clarify the intended meaning. The phrase "leaked the fluid free" is not commonly used and seems ambiguous. It might be improved by providing additional context or rephrasing to clarify the intended meaning.
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct. The correct sentence would be: "John laid the ball in the box." The verb "lay" is transitive and requires a direct object, but in this sentence, it is used as an intransitive verb, which is incorrect.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and makes sense.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and makes sense contextually.

1	The sentence is correct.

1	The sentence is correct.
1	The sentence is correct. "I can't believe Fred won't, either" is a common phrase used to express disbelief or disagreement with Fred's decision or action. The word "either" is used correctly in this context to mean "also" or "neither."
0	The sentence is not correct. It should be: "John wants to read Fred's story, and I want to as well." or "John wants to read Fred's story, and so do I."
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect. It should be: "We wanted to invite someone, but we couldn't decide whom to invite." The word "who" is subjective and used for the subject of a sentence or clause, while "whom" is objective and used for the object of a sentence or clause. In this case, "whom" is correct because it is the object of the verb "invite."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and makes sense.
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect. It seems like it is missing a verb after "that." A possible correction could be: "Mary claimed that Holly shouldn't eat cabbage."

1	The sentence is grammatically correct and uses the proper form of the verb "will work" to indicate a future action.
0	The sentence is incorrect because it is ambiguous and can have two different meanings. It can be interpreted as either Sally is also bothered by Joe's neuroses, or Sally is also a source of bother for Joe's patrons. To correct the sentence and convey the first meaning, it can be rewritten as, "Joe's neuroses bother his patrons, and they bother Sally too." For the second meaning, it can be rewritten as, "Joe's neuroses bother his patrons, and so does Sally."
0	The sentence is not correct. The correct sentence should be: "I know which book Jos√© didn't read for class, and which book Lilly read for him."
0	The sentence is not correct. The issue lies in the second part of the sentence: "and this is the one which Fred won't do." The verb "do" is incorrect and incomplete in this context. It should be replaced with a more specific verb that indicates Fred's action or intention regarding the book. For example, you could say, "and this is the one Fred won't review."
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect. It seems like the sentence is trying to convey that the speaker knows which book Mag read and which book Bob claimed the listener hadn't read. However, the way it is currently structured, the sentence lacks a clear subject and is not grammatically coherent. To correct it, you could consider rewriting it as: "I know which book Mag read and which book Bob said you hadn't read."
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect and needs to be rewritten for clarity. It seems like there are missing or misplaced words, and the sentence structure is confusing.
0	The correct sentence would be: "I'm sure I would like him to eat fruit more than cookies." The word "to" after "like" is not necessary and sounds awkward in this context.
0	The correct sentence would be: "Rusty talked about himself only after Mary had talked about him." The auxiliary verb "did" is not necessary in this sentence, and the verb "talk" should be in the past perfect tense ("had talked") to indicate that it happened before Rusty talked about himself.
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct. It should be: "Fred talked about everything before Rusty talked about something." Using "did" after "before" is incorrect and changes the meaning of the sentence.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and follows a simple subject-verb-object structure.
0	This sentence is not grammatically correct. The correct sentence would be: "The problem is easily perceived." or "One can easily perceive the problem."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and uses the correct verb form "surrounded" for the plural subject "A hundred men."
0	The sentence is incorrect. In this sentence, the pronoun "me" is used as the object of the verb "elected," which is not correct. To fix the sentence, the pronoun "I" should be used instead: "We elected **I**."
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect and could be improved as follows: "Which report did he submit that labeled John incompetent?" or "Which report did he submit that labeled John as incompetent?"
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and uses the correct verb form and punctuation.

1	The sentence is grammatically correct and follows a simple subject-verb-object structure.
0	This sentence is grammatically incorrect. It seems like there are some missing or misplaced words, and the sentence structure is unclear. It should be corrected for better grammar and clarity.
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct. The phrase "He attributed [something] to [something else]" requires the first "[something]" to be a noun phrase and the second "[something else]" to be a pronoun or noun phrase. In this case, the first "something" is the noun phrase "the fire" and the second "something else" should be "it," referring to the short circuit. The correct sentence would be: "He attributed the fire to a short circuit, which was caused by an overloaded transducer, that destroyed most of my factory."
0	The sentence is not correct. Here is the corrected version: "The mayor regarded the proposal to build a sidewalk from Dartmouth to Smith as being absurd."
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect. It seems to be a mix of two sentence structures: "I want [that] Bill left" and "I want [for] it to remain a secret." To correct the sentence, it should be rewritten as either "I want Bill to have left to remain a secret" or "I wanted Bill's leaving to remain a secret."
0	The sentence is not correct. The correct sentence would be: "I know a man whom Tom drives as he drives." The word "whom" is the correct objective pronoun to use after the relative pronoun "who" in this sentence.
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct. It seems to be attempting to convey that it is challenging to rescue cats that are in the process of drowning, which is an illegal act. However, the current structure is ambiguous and confusing. A clearer way to express this idea would be: "Rescuing drowning cats, which is against the law, can be difficult."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and uses the word "than" correctly in the context of a comparison.
0	The sentence is not correct. The correct sentence would be: "Rutherford understands himself." The word "himself" is a reflexive pronoun and should be used when the subject and the object of a sentence are the same. In this case, "himself" is not the subject of the sentence, so it is not correct to use it.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and expresses the speaker's belief that someone named Arch will arrive or "show up."
0	The correct sentence would be: "The proof that this set is recursive is difficult." The word "that" is necessary to introduce the following clause and make the sentence grammatically correct.
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct. It seems like it's trying to say that Henry plays the lute and sings madrigals, but the way it's currently structured is not correct. To fix it, one way would be to say, "Henry's performances of madrigals, where he plays the lute and sings, sound lousy."
0	The sentence is incorrect. The correct sentence would be: "Tom picked these grapes, and I washed some turnips, and Suzie will prepare those grapes." The sentence uses the pronoun "these" to refer to the grapes twice, but the second instance should use "those" to distinguish between the two instances of grapes mentioned.
1	The sentence is correct and follows the proper subject-verb agreement and word order.
0	The correct sentence would be: "Which boy's employer did we elect guardian president?"
1	The sentence is correct. It is a common phrase used to ask about someone's mental health or state of mind.
0	This sentence is incorrect because of the use of the word "too" at the end. The word "too" is used to indicate that something is also the case for someone or something else, but in this sentence, it is not needed because the sentence already mentions that both the speaker and their dad live at the place where Route 150 crosses the Hudson River. Removing "too" at the end of the sentence would make it correct.
0	The sentence is incorrect and should be: "I live at the place where Route 150 crosses the Hudson River, and my dad lives there too." The error is in the use of the pronoun "it" to refer to the place where both the speaker and their dad live. In this context, the correct pronoun to use would be "there."
0	The correct sentence would be: "Who is she trying to make up with now?" or "To whom is she trying to make up now?" The preposition "to" is not typically used after the phrase "make up with," and the sentence as written sounds awkward and is not grammatically correct.
0	The correct sentence would be: "Wind was gotten of a plot to negotiate an honorable end of the war in Vietnam." The word "of" is more appropriate in this context as it indicates possession or belonging.
0	The sentence is incorrect because the preposition "to" is unnecessary and not typically used after the verb "talked" in this context. It should be: "Mike talked about politics with my friends yesterday."
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct. A passive voice is used in this sentence, so the subject is "The principal" and the object is "some teacher." So, the correct sentence would be: "It was expected by the reporters that some teachers would be fired by the principal."
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect. It should be "Which hat did Mike quip that **he** never wore?" to maintain subject-verb agreement.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and does not contain any errors.
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect. It should be "We donated wire for the convicts to build cages."
0	This sentence is not grammatically correct. It should be "I won't have any money." or "I will not have some money."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and does not contain any errors.
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect. It should be: "I won't ask you to believe that he tried to force me to give him any money." The pronoun "her" does not agree with the antecedent "he."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and makes sense in context.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and natural-sounding.
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect. It seems that the sentence is trying to convey that John is worried because the police want him, but Mary is not worried because the police want her. However, the sentence structure and use of pronouns are confusing and need to be revised for clarity.
0	The correct sentence is: "I'll work on it if Sam is working on it." The future progressive tense ("will be working") is not appropriate in this context, as it suggests a prolonged or ongoing action in the future, which doesn't align with the intended meaning. Instead, the present progressive tense ("is working") indicates a current or ongoing action and is more suitable for expressing a condition or dependency.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and uses the correct verb conjugation and punctuation.
0	The sentence is not correct. Here is the correct version: Here's a knife for you to cut the onions with.
0	This sentence is incorrect. It should be "Fluffy is sick, which is not known by everybody." or "Fluffy is sick, but not everyone knows it."
1	The sentence is correct.
0	The sentence is not correct because it contains a repetition of the conjunction "and". To fix it, remove one of the "and" conjunctions: "The younger woman might have been tall, and the older one definitely was blond."
0	The sentence has a punctuation error and a grammatical error. The comma after "blond" is unnecessary and should be removed. Additionally, the verb "is" after "blond" should be changed to "blonde" to match the adjective with the subject "Sheila."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and uses proper syntax and vocabulary.
0	This sentence is incorrect. The phrase "to be planned" doesn't make sense in this context and seems to be unnecessary. It might be corrected to say: "The socks are ready for you to put on as planned."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and makes sense.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and makes sense contextually.
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect. It seems like the sentence is trying to convey that the speaker's mother is easy to please, and this trait is being compared to the father somehow, but the structure is unclear and incorrect as given. To correct it, one might say: "My mother is easy to please; my father, however, is not."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and does not contain any errors.
0	The sentence is not correct and should be: "That the cops spoke to the janitor about that robbery yesterday is terrible."

0	The sentence is not correct. It should be "Everybody around here who ever buys anything on credit talks in their sleep."
1	The sentence is correct.
0	The correct sentence should be: "No writer, and no playwright, meets in Vienna." The sentence as it stands is incorrect because the verb "meet" should be singular to agree with the singular subjects "no writer" and "no playwright."
0	The correct sentence should be: "No writer, nor any playwright, meets in Vienna." The word "nor" is used to connect two negative ideas or clauses. In this sentence, we have "no writer" and "nor any playwright," both denoting negative ideas.
0	The correct sentence would be: "That you will marry any student is uncertain." The word "uncertain" means that something is not definitely going to happen or is not known for sure. In this sentence, "uncertain" describes the likelihood of the person marrying any student, which is unclear or unlikely.
0	The sentence is not correct. It seems that the preposition "off" is not suitable here. A better preposition might be "from."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and uses the phrase "halfway around the world" idiomatically to describe the distance the package has travelled.
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct. It seems that the prepositional phrase "out of the basket" is modifying the verb "gave," suggesting that Sam gave the ball by taking it out of the basket. However, the phrase "out of" in this context typically indicates movement away from a location, which doesn't align with the action of giving. To maintain clarity and correct grammar, the sentence could be restructured: "Sam took the ball out of the basket and gave it away."
0	The sentence is not correct. The correct sentence would be: "Sam took the ball out of the basket."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and makes sense.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and makes sense.
0	The correct phrase should be "No one can forgive you for that comment." or "No one can forgive that comment from you." as the preposition "to" is not suitable in this context.
0	The phrase "blew up" is incorrect in this context. A more appropriate phrase would be "exploded" or "was destroyed."
0	The sentence is not correct. The pronoun "her" in the phrase "gave it to her son" is ambiguous and could refer to either Sarah or Catherine. To improve the sentence, you could rewrite it as: "Sarah promised Catherine her old car, but then gave the car to her own son instead." This makes it clear that "her son" refers to Sarah's son.
0	The sentence is incorrect and should be "I lent part of the book to Tony."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and makes sense semantically.
0	This sentence is ambiguous and can have two meanings. It can mean that the farmer dumped the cart along with the apples or that the farmer dumped the apples that were in the cart. To make the sentence clear, it can be rewritten as, "The farmer dumped the apples that were in the cart."

1	The sentence is grammatically correct and makes sense.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and expresses a complete thought.
0	The sentence is incorrect because the use of the article "the" before "dedication" is not appropriate in this context. When referring to a quality or trait that someone displays, we don't use a definite article like "the." To correct the sentence, simply omit "the" before "dedication."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and uses the passive voice effectively.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and makes sense contextually.
1	The sentence is correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and has the correct sentence structure.
0	The sentence is incorrect. The correct phrase would be "Paperback books are easily lifted onto the table."
0	The sentence is not correct. The correct sentence would be: "The books were lifted onto the table." The verb "lift" requires a subject that is doing the lifting and an object that is being lifted. In this sentence, "books" are the object being lifted, so we need to use a passive voice verb ("were lifted") to describe the action.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and makes sense.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and makes sense.
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct. The correct sentence would be: "Jessica crammed boxes into the truck." The preposition "at" is not the right choice for this sentence.

0	The sentence is not correct. A possible correction could be: "The jeweller scribbled his name on the contract."
0	This sentence is incorrect. The phrase "grow into" is used when something develops or changes into something else over time. In this case, it is incorrect because an acorn cannot develop or change into an oak tree; it is already an oak tree in its earliest stage of development. The correct sentence would be: "The gardener nurtured the acorn, which grew into an oak tree."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and makes sense.
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct. It seems to be missing a subject or a main clause that describes what the children are doing. To correct it, you could say, "The children are amused" or provide a subject and verb for the sentence, such as "The clowns amused the children."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and makes sense.
0	The verb "whisper" is used when the subject speaks softly to someone. The correct preposition to use with "whisper" is "to" and not "at." The correct sentence would be: "Susan whispered to Rachel."

0	The correct phrase would be "Linda puckered her lips." The verb "to wink" is not used to describe the action of pursing one's lips together, which is what "pucker" means.
0	The correct sentence would be "My heart is pounding." In this sentence, "pounding" is a verb that describes the action of the heart beating strongly or rapidly. The use of "me" as the object of the sentence is incorrect and changes the meaning.

1	The sentence is grammatically correct and makes sense semantically.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and uses proper punctuation.

1	The sentence is grammatically correct and makes sense.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and makes sense contextually.
0	The sentence is not correct. The correct sentence would be: "A wonderful opportunity presented itself yesterday."

1	The sentence is grammatically correct and follows the subject-verb-object structure.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and makes sense.
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect. The correct sentence would be "Much information was provided." This is because "information" is a non-count noun in English and cannot be used with the article "many." Instead, we use the word "much" for non-count nouns to indicate a large quantity or amount.
0	The word "advice" is uncountable in standard English, so we would use "much" or "a lot of" rather than "many." The correct sentence would be: "John offers much advice."

0	The sentence is not correct grammatically. Here is the correct version: It was the policeman who met several young students in the park last night.
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct. It seems to be missing a noun or a pronoun after the verb "meet." To correct the sentence, we need more context or information to determine whom the policeman met in the park. For example, we could say, "Did the policeman meet someone in the park?" or "Did the policeman and the woman meet in the park?"
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and makes sense.

0	The sentence is not correct because it is ambiguous. It could mean that John bought a book that was on the table, or it could mean that John bought a book about tables.

0	The sentence is not grammatically correct. It seems like it's missing a word or phrase that would indicate the action being performed by "beating." Also, the use of "alienated" doesn't seem appropriate in this context. It might be more appropriate to use a verb that indicates a harsh or violent action. To correct the sentence, it could be rewritten as: "Kim abused cats and beat his dog brutally."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and makes sense contextually.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and makes sense in the context of the question.
0	The correct sentence would be: "I want to try to buy some whiskey." The word "try" in this context is a verb and should be followed by the infinitive form of the verb "to buy," hence "to buy."
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct. The correct sentence would be: "She goes and buys some whiskey." The verb "go" in the present tense conjugates to "goes" in the third person singular (she/he/it), but "buy" conjugates to "buys" following the same rule.
0	The sentence is incorrect because the subject, "Kim and Terry," is a compound subject and should be followed by a plural verb. The correct verb form should be "are" instead of "is."

1	The sentence is grammatically correct and uses the correct verb form "loaned" for past tense.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and follows the standard subject-verb-object structure. "The paper" is the subject, "is cut" is the passive verb, and "by Mary" indicates the agent or doer of the action.

1	The sentence is grammatically correct and makes sense semantically.

1	The sentence is grammatically correct and makes sense.
0	The sentence is incorrect because the reflexive pronoun "himself" should be "herself" to agree with the antecedent "John's mother."
0	The sentence is incorrect because the pronoun "himself" does not agree in gender with the antecedent "Mary." To fix the sentence, the pronoun should be changed to "herself."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and makes sense.

0	The sentence is not grammatically correct and appears to be incomplete. It seems like it might be the beginning of a sentence or a phrase, but it lacks a main verb and any context to understand the intended meaning. To correct it, additional information is needed to provide a complete thought or action.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and makes sense.
0	This sentence seems to be incomplete and, therefore, incorrect. It seems like there might be a missing verb after the word "demonized," which would complete the sentence.
0	The correct sentence should be "You kicked yourself." The verb "kick" is reflexive, and the reflexive pronoun to use depends on the subject of the sentence. In this case, the subject "you" is plural, so the correct reflexive pronoun to use is "yourself," not "yourselves."
0	The provided sentence is not grammatically correct. Here is the corrected version: "The book that I said I'd never read."
0	This sentence is not grammatically correct and seems to be missing context. It appears that there may be a verb missing after "demonized," and the phrase "up the Khyber" is not commonly used and may be idiomatic or slang.
1	The sentence is correct.
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct and seems to be an imperative statement or an instruction. The correct sentence would depend on the context but could be "Kick me!" or "Kick yourself!"
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and conveys a complete thought.
0	The correct sentence would be: "Whom did you get an accurate description of?" or "For whom did you get an accurate description?" The original sentence uses the wrong pronoun "who," which is used for the subject of a sentence or clause. The correct pronoun, "whom," is used as the object of a preposition or verb and is the object of the preposition "of" in this sentence.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and does not contain any errors.
0	The sentence is not a complete thought and does not express a complete idea. It seems to be a fragment of a larger sentence or thought. To correct it, additional context or information is needed to provide a complete understanding.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and does not contain any errors.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and follows standard English syntax and structure.
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct. It seems like a sentence fragment as it is missing a verb. A possible correction could be: "Anson demonized David every day."

1	The sentence is grammatically correct and makes sense.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and makes sense.
0	The sentence is not correct. The issue lies in the usage of the adverb "Extremely frantically." While it is possible to use multiple adverbs to modify the same verb, in this case, the combination is redundant and awkward. "Frantically" already conveys an extreme sense of haste and frenzy, so adding "extremely" doesn't provide any additional meaningful information and makes the sentence sound unnatural. To correct the sentence, you could use either "frantically" or "extremely" but not both together.
0	This sentence is grammatically incorrect. It seems to be missing some words or context that would make the sentence complete and understandable.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and expresses a complete thought.
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct. A possible correction could be: "Medea tried to get the nurse to poison her children."

0	This sentence is not grammatically correct and seems to be missing a word or has a word missing, it should be either "I knew that she was happy" or "I ate what she was happy with".
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and makes sense.
1	The sentence is correct.
0	The correct sentence would be: "Gilgamesh is fighting the dragon." or "Gilgamesh has fought the dragon." The original sentence mixes tenses and does not make sense.
0	The sentence is incorrect. The correct sentence would be "Anson thought that he was happy." The reflexive pronoun "himself" is not used correctly in this sentence. Reflexive pronouns are used when the subject and the object of a sentence refer to the same person or thing. In this sentence, "Anson" is the subject and "he" (not "himself") is the correct object form of the pronoun.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and does not contain any errors.
0	The correct sentence would be: "I might not be going to the party but might be washing my hair." The sentence as it stands is grammatically incorrect due to the double negative ("might be not").
0	The correct sentence would be "I thought he liked me." The word "myself" is a reflexive pronoun and is used when the subject and the object of a sentence are the same person. In this sentence, the subject is "I" and the object is "me," so the correct pronoun to use is "me."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and makes sense semantically.
0	The sentence uses too many verbs of perception, resulting in an awkward and unnecessarily wordy construction. It is also unclear if Jason is actually sick or just appears that way. The sentence could be rewritten as: "Jason appears to be sick." or "Jason seems unwell."
0	This sentence is grammatically incorrect. The correct sentence would be: "To whom did you ask a question?" or "What did you ask the person who saw?"
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and makes sense in the context of linguistics.
0	This sentence is not correct. The correct sentence would be: "He will be able to go." or "He can go."

0	This sentence is grammatically incorrect. The correct sentence would be: "Which king did you ask about the invasion of which city?" or "Which king did you ask about invading which city?" The original sentence has a confusing structure and is not grammatically sound.
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect. Here is the corrected version: "It is some disgruntled old pigs in those ditches that humans love to eat pork from."
