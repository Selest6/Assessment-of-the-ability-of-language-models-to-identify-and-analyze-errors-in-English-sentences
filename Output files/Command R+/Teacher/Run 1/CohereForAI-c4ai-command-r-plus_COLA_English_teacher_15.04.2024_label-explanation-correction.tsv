1	The sentence is already correct.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is already correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence is not correct because the verb tenses are inconsistent. The sentence uses the past perfect tense "had eaten," which indicates a past action that occurred before another past action. However, the second part of the sentence uses the present tense "want," which does not match the past tense of "had eaten." To correct the sentence, the verb tense in the second part of the sentence should be changed to match the past tense of the first part.	If you had eaten more, you would have wanted less.
0	This sentence is not correct grammatically. The correct sentence would depend on the context, but it could be: "As you eat the most, you want it the least."	The correct sentence may be: "As you eat the most, you want it the least."
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect. It seems like a case of a missing verb after the word "want."	The more you would want it, the less you would eat.
0	The correct phrase should be "the more John eats." Here, "eats" is the correct verb form that agrees with the singular subject "John."	I demand that the more John eats, the more he pays.
0	The sentence is not correct because it is a run-on sentence, which means it contains two independent clauses that are not joined correctly. In this case, the two independent clauses are "Mary listens to the Grateful Dead" and "she gets depressed." One way to correct this sentence would be to join the two clauses with a conjunction.	Mary listens to the Grateful Dead and she gets depressed.

0	The use of "lots more" in this sentence is not correct. It should be replaced with "much more" or "a lot more".	John was much more obnoxious than Fred.
1	The sentence is already correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	This sentence is not grammatically correct. In this sentence, the comparative degree is used incorrectly with the word "more." When using comparatives, the correct form would be "The more Bill smokes, the more Susan hates him."	The more Bill smokes, the more Susan hates him.
1	The sentence is already correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence is not correct because the pronoun "he" assumes the senator is a man. To make the sentence gender-neutral, the pronoun should be replaced with "they."	Every senator seems to become more corrupt as they talk to more lobbyists.
0	This sentence is grammatically incorrect and does not make sense. It seems like there might be a missing word or the sentence structure is not correct.	Who does John visit because he likes Sally?
1	The sentence is already correct.	The sentence is already correct.

1	The sentence is already correct.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is already correct.	The tub leaked water.
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect. In this sentence, "water" is the subject, and "did" is a past tense verb. However, the verb "fill" should be used in the past passive participle form, "filled," to agree with the past tense of "did."	What the water did to the bottle was fill it.
0	The sentence is incorrect because the verb "fill" should be conjugated as "filled" to agree with the subject "water."	What the water did to the whole bottle was fill it.
0	This sentence is grammatically incorrect. The use of the word "free" at the end of the sentence is incorrect and does not make sense in this context. It seems like there might be a missing word or the phrase "for free" was intended, but as it stands, the sentence is not correct.	The sentence should be corrected to make sense and convey the intended meaning clearly. However, without additional context, it is challenging to provide a precise correction. Here is one possible correction: "The tank leaked the fluid, spilling it everywhere for free."
0	The sentence is not correct because the verb "lay" is used incorrectly in this context. The correct verb to use here is "laid," which is the past tense of "to lay."	John laid the ball in the box.
1	The sentence is already correct.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is already correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	This sentence is incorrect and needs to be rewritten for proper grammar and clarity. There are issues with word choice and punctuation.	Most people probably consider Klaus guilty of murder, even though the courts didn't actually find him guilty.
0	This sentence is not correct because the word "beautifully" is an adverb that is used to describe how something is done. In this case, it is describing the way Mary plays the violin. However, the verb "play" requires an adjective, not an adverb, to describe it.	Mary plays the violin beautifully.
1	The sentence is already correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence is not correct because it contains a prepositional phrase ("to Bill") followed by a noun ("a book"). In this case, the preposition "to" should be dropped, and the object of the preposition ("Bill") should be placed after the noun ("book") in the sentence.	Sue gave Bill a book.
1	The sentence is already correct.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is already correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence is not correct. It seems like it is missing some words or context to make it complete and understandable.	They represented Mary seriously to the dean as a genuine linguist.
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect. In English, the subject "us" is a pronoun that is typically used as the object of a sentence or clause, while the pronoun "we" is typically used as the subject. To correct the sentence, the subject should be changed to "We".	We love them.

1	The sentence is already correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence is incorrect because the phrase "I also want to" is not parallel with the rest of the sentence. To fix it, it should be changed to "and I also want to read it."	John wants to read Fred's story, and I also want to read it.
0	This sentence is grammatically incorrect. The correct phrase should be "We wanted to invite someone, but we couldn't decide whom to invite." The word "who" is subjective and used as the subject of a clause, while "whom" is objective and used as the object of a verb or preposition. In this sentence, "whom" is the correct choice because it is the object of the preposition "to."	We wanted to invite someone, but we couldn't decide whom to invite.
1	The sentence is already correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	This sentence is incorrect and has a grammatical error. The correct sentence should have a comma after "cabbage" to set off the dependent clause and make the sentence structure clear.	Mary claimed that eating cabbage, Holly shouldn't eat cabbage.
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect. The phrase "came to be" is not used correctly in this context, and the use of "and I also" is awkward and unnatural.	Mary was introduced to me by the bartender, and I introduced myself as well.
1	The sentence is already correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence is incorrect because the verb "do" should be in plural form to agree with the plural subject "neuroses."	Joe's neuroses bother his patrons, and so does Sally.
0	The sentence is incorrect because the pronoun "it" is ambiguous and can refer to either "read" or "book," making the sentence confusing. To make the sentence correct and clear, the pronoun should be replaced with a noun or a clearer pronoun.	I know which book Jos√© didn't read for class, and which book Lilly read for him.
0	The sentence is not correct because of the incorrect use of pronouns. The phrase "won't do it" is not grammatically consistent with the rest of the sentence.	This is the book that Bob reviewed, and this is the one that Fred won't review.
0	The sentence is incorrect because of the incorrect use of the verb "read." The correct form should be "read" instead of "read" as the verb is in the past tense.	I know which book Mag read, and which book Bob said that you hadn't read.
0	The sentence is not correct because of the incorrect usage of pronouns and the lack of parallelism. The sentence mixes the pronouns "which" and "that" and does not maintain parallelism in the phrase "read my report that you hadn't."	I know which book Mag read and which book Bob read; it was my report that you hadn't read.
0	The correct sentence should be "I'm sure I would like him to eat fruit more than cookies." The original sentence uses the word "would" twice, which is incorrect and sounds awkward.	I'm sure I would like him to eat fruit more than cookies.
0	The correct form of the sentence would be: "Rusty talked about himself only after Mary had talked about him." The auxiliary verb "did" is unnecessary in this sentence and disrupts the grammatical structure.	Rusty talked about himself only after Mary had talked about him.
0	This sentence is not correct because of the incorrect use of verb tenses. In a sentence with two past actions, the past simple tense should be used for both actions.	Fred talked about everything before Rusty talked about something.
1	The sentence is already correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	This sentence is not correct grammatically. The verb "perceive" is transitive, which means it needs an object. In this case, the object would describe what the problem is easily perceived by.	The problem is easily perceived.
1	The sentence is already correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect because the use of "we" as the subject and "me" as the object in the same clause is not correct.	We elected myself.
0	The sentence is incorrect because the use of "which" is not appropriate in this context. The correct word to use here is "whom."	To whom did he submit that report about John's incompetence?
1	The sentence is already correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence is not correct because of the incorrect relative pronoun usage. The relative pronoun "which" is used for non-living things or animals that are not specific or previously mentioned. In this sentence, the relative pronoun should be "who" because it refers to cats, which are specific animals.	He let the cats who were whining out.
1	The sentence is already correct.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is already grammatically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	This sentence is grammatically incorrect. It seems to be missing a word or has a word out of place, as the phrase "that John had lied" seems unfinished or incomplete.	A proof that the claim had been made was given: John had lied.
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect. The phrase "He attributed" is not correct because the verb "attribute" is transitive and requires a direct object. In this sentence, the direct object would be the noun or noun phrase that follows the verb and describes what is being attributed.	He attributed the fire, which destroyed most of my factory, to a short circuit caused by an overloaded transducer.
0	The sentence is not correct grammatically. The phrase "regarded as" should be followed by a noun, not a noun phrase.	The mayor regarded the proposal to build a sidewalk from Dartmouth to Smith as being absurd.
0	The correct sentence should be "I want that Bill's leaving remain a secret." The original sentence is incorrect because the verb "left" is not in the correct form.	I want that Bill's leaving remain a secret.
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect. The use of the relative pronoun "who" is incorrect in this context, and the sentence structure is awkward and unclear.	I know a man whom Tom drives just as he drives.
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect due to a subject-verb agreement issue. The subject "Drowning cats" is plural, so the verb "is" should be changed to "are" to agree with the subject.	Drowning cats, which is against the law, are hard to rescue.
1	The sentence is already correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence is not correct because the reflexive pronoun "himself" is used incorrectly. Reflexive pronouns are used when the subject and the object of a sentence refer to the same person or thing. In this sentence, "Rutherford" is the subject and "himself" is the object, but they do not refer to the same person. To correct the sentence, we need to use a different pronoun that agrees with "Rutherford".	Rutherford is understood by him.
1	The sentence is already correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The correct article for the word "proof" in this context is "the" instead of "the." The sentence also needs to specify what the set is recursive in or of. A possible correction: "The proof that this set is recursive in this theory is difficult."	The proof that this set is recursive in this theory is difficult.
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect. It seems like the sentence is trying to say that Henry plays the lute and sings madrigals, but the current structure is not correct.	The madrigals that Henry plays on the lute and sings sound lousy.
1	The sentence is already correct.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is already correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect. It contains errors in punctuation, verb agreement, and noun pluralization.	Which boys' employers did we elect as guardians of the president?
0	The sentence is not correct because the word "sane" is an adjective and needs a copula (a form of the verb "to be") before it.	How sane is Peter?
0	The sentence is incorrect because of the use of "the River" without a specific name, and the repetitive use of "the place where Route 150 crosses..." phrase.	I live where Route 150 crosses the Hudson River, and so does my dad.
0	This sentence is incorrect because the pronoun "it" is ambiguous and does not clearly refer to a specific noun.	I live at the place where Route 150 crosses the Hudson River and my dad lives there too.
0	The correct preposition to use in this sentence is "with," not "to." The phrase "make up with someone" means to reconcile or restore a relationship with that person.	Who is she trying to make up with now?
0	The sentence is not correct grammatically. The verb "get" is used incorrectly in this sentence. A correct phrase could be "was aware of".	Wind was gotten aware of a plot to negotiate an honorable end to the war in Vietnam.
0	The sentence is incorrect because the preposition "to" is missing an object. In this sentence, the noun phrase "my friends" is the object of the preposition "to," but it is missing the word "with," which is needed to complete the phrase and indicate that Mike talked with your friends.	Mike talked about politics yesterday with my friends.
0	The sentence is not correct because the use of the passive voice makes it awkward and unclear.	The reporters expected that the principal would fire some teachers.
0	The sentence is not correct because the verb "quip" requires a subject that is typically a person, but "Mike" is a male name and therefore a he, not a she.	Which hat did Mike quip that he never wore?
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct. It seems like it might be missing a word or has an incorrect word order.	Which girl did Mike quip that never wore this hat?
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect. The correct phrase would be "We donated wire for the convicts with which to build cages." The phrase "for the convicts to build cages with" is an incorrect prepositional phrase that should be replaced with a phrase functioning as a noun to be correct.	We donated wire for the convicts with which to build cages.
0	This sentence is not correct grammatically. The correct phrase should be "I won't have any money." The word "some" is incorrect in this context.	I won't have any money.
1	The sentence is already correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence is incorrect because the pronouns "I," "he," and "her" do not agree. The sentence tries to describe an interaction between three people (I, he, and her), but the verb "force" requires a direct object, which is missing in this sentence.	I won't ask you to believe that he attempted to force me to give it to her or that he tried to get me to give her some money.
1	The sentence is already correct.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is already correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence is incorrect because it contains a pronoun error. In the first part of the sentence, the pronoun "him" is used to refer to John, but in the second part, the pronoun "her" is used without a clear antecedent. To maintain clarity, it is important to use consistent and unambiguous references.	That the fuzz wanted him worried John, but it didn't worry Mary that they wanted her.
0	The sentence is not correct because it uses two different verb forms ("will work" and "will be working") in the same sentence, which is not grammatically consistent.	I'll work on it if Sam works on it, too.
1	The sentence is already correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect. The correct phrase would be "here is a knife with which you can cut the onions" or simply "here is a knife you can cut the onions with." The original sentence mixes up the phrases "for you to do something" and "for something to be done."	Here's a knife with which you can cut up the onions.
0	This sentence is a comma splice. It joins two independent clauses with only a comma.	Fluffy is sick, but not everybody knows.
1	The sentence is already correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	This sentence is incorrect due to the presence of a comma splice, which is the incorrect use of a comma to join two independent clauses. In this case, the independent clauses are "The younger woman might have been tall" and "the older one definitely was blond."	The younger woman might have been tall, and the older one definitely was blond.
0	This sentence has a few issues. Firstly, the comma after "blond" is unnecessary and should be removed. Secondly, the verb "be" is missing after "may" and "is" in the phrase "may be blond" and "definitely is, blond". Finally, there should be a comma after "tall" to set off the appositive phrase "and may be blond".	Sally is tall and may be blond, and Sheila is short and definitely is blond.
1	The sentence is already correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	This sentence contains redundant words ("for" is repeated, and "to be planned" doesn't make sense in this context) and doesn't convey a clear meaning.	The socks are ready for you to put on.

1	The sentence is already correct.	The sentence is already correct.

0	The sentence is not correct and has a syntax error.	That the cops spoke to the janitor about that robbery yesterday is terrible.
0	The given sentence is not correct grammatically. There is a mistake in the sentence structure and word order.	Every student who wears socks is a swinger.
0	The sentence is incorrect because the word "my" is possessive and suggests that the binoculars belong to the speaker, while the rest of the sentence suggests that the binoculars were given to the girl by someone else. This mix of possession and action performed by someone else creates ambiguity and makes the sentence grammatically incorrect.	That girl was given binoculars by him.
1	The sentence is already correct.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is already correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence is incorrect because the verb "buy" should be in the present perfect tense, not the past perfect tense. The word "ever" is also unnecessary and should be removed.	Everybody around here who ever buys anything on credit talks in their sleep.
0	This sentence is incorrect. The correct phrase is "I can't remember somebody's name." The original sentence places the modifier "name" between the verb "remember" and its object "somebody," which is not grammatically correct.	I can't remember somebody's name.
0	The correct conjunction to use in this sentence is "Neither...nor..." instead of "No...and no..." to express the negative idea involving two subjects.	Neither writer nor playwright meets in Vienna.
0	The sentence is incorrect because of the incorrect use of the conjunction "nor." When using "nor," the second clause should maintain the same structure as the first clause, so it should be "nor does any playwright."	No writer, nor does any playwright, meet in Vienna.
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect. It seems like a mix of two ideas, resulting in an incoherent structure.	It is not certain that you will marry any student.
0	This sentence is incorrect and ambiguous. It can be interpreted in two ways: either Felicia, who was sitting on a bench, kicked a ball that was on the bench, or Felicia kicked the ball from its position on the bench, causing it to fall off. To clarify the sentence and avoid ambiguity, it should be rewritten to provide more context and clearly indicate the intended meaning.	The sentence needs to be corrected to clarify the intended meaning. Here's one way to do that: "Felicia, sitting on the bench, kicked the ball that was on the bench." or "Felicia kicked the ball, causing it to fall off the bench."
1	The sentence is already correct.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is already correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect. The correct phrase would be "took the ball out of the basket" or "removed the ball out of the basket" because the ball was already in the basket and some action was performed to get it out of the basket.	Sam took the ball out of the basket.
1	The sentence is already correct.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is already correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect. The correct preposition to use with "forgive" in this context is "for" rather than "to."	No one can forgive that comment for you.
0	The phrase "blew up" in this context usually means "exploded." However, because of the positive tone of the sentence, the phrase "blew up" might be interpreted as something positive, which is not the intended meaning. To avoid confusion, a clearer alternative phrase should be used.	We launched the rocket toward the moon, but it exploded before reaching its destination.
1	The sentence is already correct.	The sentence is already correct.
