1	The sentence is correct. It is a hypothetical statement using the past perfect ("had eaten") and the conditional ("would want") to express a counterfactual idea.
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct. It seems to be missing some context or words that would clarify the relationship between the two clauses. It could be corrected by adding additional information to provide a complete thought, such as: "As you eat the most, you want the least amount of food."
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect. It seems like it's trying to convey the idea that wanting more of something leads to eating less of it, but the structure is not quite right. It should have a noun or a pronoun after the word "want" to indicate the object of desire. A correct version could be: "The more you would want it, the less you would eat."
0	The sentence is not correct. It should be "the more John eats," not "eat." The verb "eat" is incorrect because it is not conjugated properly for the subject "John."
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct. It is a run-on sentence, which means it contains two independent clauses that are not properly joined. To correct it, one could use a conjunction or insert a period and capitalize the "S" in "she." Here is an example: "Mary listens to the Grateful Dead, and she gets depressed." or "Mary listens to the Grateful Dead. She gets depressed."

1	The sentence is grammatically correct and uses the comparative degree correctly.
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct. It should be "Every senator seems to become more corrupt as he or she talks to more lobbyists" to maintain gender neutrality, or the pronoun "they" could be used as a singular, although this may not be accepted in all styles.

0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect. It seems like it might be missing a word or has a word out of place. To correct the sentence, one might consider changing it to "The tank leaked the fluid freely." This would indicate that the fluid was able to escape from the tank without obstruction.
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct. The correct verb to use with the noun "ball" as the object would be "laid," which agrees with the past tense form of the verb "to lay."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and makes sense.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and follows the correct subject-verb agreement.
0	The correct sentence should be: "Most people probably consider Klaus guilty of murder, even though the courts didn't actually find him guilty."
1	The sentence is correct.

0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect. It should be: "We wanted to invite someone, but we couldn't decide whom to invite." The word "who" is subjective and should be replaced with "whom" in this case because it is the object of the preposition "to."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and makes sense.
0	This sentence is grammatically incorrect. It seems to be missing a verb after the word "that." To correct the sentence, you could add a verb that agrees with the verb "claimed." For example:  Label: 1 Explanation: Mary claimed that eating cabbage was delicious, so Holly shouldn't deny herself the pleasure.
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct. It seems like there is a missing word or phrase after "I also came to be." It might be more clear if it was written as "Mary was introduced to me by the bartender, and I also introduced myself."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and expresses a future intention in a clear and concise manner.
0	The sentence is incorrect because it is ambiguous and can have two different meanings. It can either mean that both Joe and Sally's neuroses bother his patrons, or it can mean that Joe's neuroses bother his patrons, and Sally also bothers them. To correct the sentence and make the meaning clear, it can be rewritten as: "Joe's neuroses bother his patrons, and so does Sally."
0	The sentence is not correct. The correct sentence should be: "I know which book Jos√© didn't read for class, and which book Lilly read for him."
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct. It should be: "This is the book which Bob reviewed, and this is the one which Fred won't review." or "This is the book Bob reviewed, and Fred won't review this one."
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect. It should be: "I know which book Mag read and which book Bob said you hadn't read." The original sentence is missing the word "read" after "hadn't," which is necessary to complete the thought and maintain grammatical consistency.
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect and needs to be rewritten for clarity. It seems like the intention is to convey knowledge of the books that Mag and Bob read, but the phrase "my report that you hadn't" is ambiguous and does not seem to fit with the rest of the sentence.
0	The correct sentence would be: "I'm sure I would like him to eat fruit more than cookies." The word "to" before "eat" is unnecessary and makes the sentence sound awkward.
0	The correct sentence would be: "Rusty talked about himself only after Mary had talked about him." The auxiliary verb "did" is unnecessary in this sentence and disrupts the grammatical structure.
0	This sentence is not correct. It should be: "Fred talked about everything before Rusty talked about something." The correct sentence uses the past tense "talked" for both "Fred" and "Rusty" to maintain consistency in the sentence structure.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and makes sense.
0	This sentence is not grammatically correct. The correct sentence would be: "The problem is easily perceived." or "One can easily perceive the problem."

0	The sentence is not correct. Here is the corrected version: "The mayor regarded the proposal to build a sidewalk from Dartmouth to Smith as being absurd."
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect. The correct sentence would be: "I want that Bill's leaving remain a secret." or "I want Bill to leave and keep it a secret."
0	The sentence is not correct. The correct sentence would be: "I know a man whom Tom drives as he drives." The word "whom" is the correct objective pronoun to use after the relative pronoun "who" in this context.
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct. Here is the corrected version: "Rescuing drowning cats, which is against the law, is hard." The original sentence uses the wrong verb form ("are" instead of "is") and places the subject ("drowning cats") after the verb, resulting in an ungrammatical construction.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and does not contain any errors.
0	The reflexive pronoun "himself" is used incorrectly in this sentence. Reflexive pronouns are used when the subject and the object of a sentence refer to the same person or thing. In this sentence, "Rutherford" is the subject and "himself" is the object, but they do not refer to the same person. To correct the sentence, you could say "Rutherford understands himself."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and expresses the speaker's belief that someone named Arch will arrive.
0	The correct sentence would be: "The proof that this set is recursive is difficult." The word "that" is necessary to introduce the following clause and make the sentence grammatically correct.
0	This sentence is not grammatically correct. It seems like it's trying to say that Henry plays the lute and sings madrigals, but the way it's currently structured is not correct. To fix it, one way would be to say, "Henry's performances of madrigals, where he plays the lute and sings, sound lousy."
0	The sentence is incorrect. The correct sentence would be: "Tom picked these grapes, and I washed some turnips, and Suzie will prepare them." The pronoun "them" refers to both "these grapes" and "some turnips," which were mentioned previously in the sentence.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and seems to be asking about two separate events: someone going somewhere and someone eating something.
0	The correct sentence would be: "Which boy's employer did we elect guardian president?"
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct. It seems to be missing a verb. A possible correction could be: "How sane is Peter behaving?" or "How sane does Peter seem?"
0	This sentence is incorrect because of the use of the word "too" at the end. The word "too" is used to indicate that something is also the case for someone or something else, but in this sentence, it is not needed because the sentence already mentions that both the speaker and their dad live at the place where Route 150 crosses the Hudson River. Removing "too" at the end of the sentence would make it correct.
0	The sentence is incorrect and should be: "I live at the place where Route 150 crosses the Hudson River, and my dad lives there too." The error is in the use of the pronoun "it" to refer to the place where both the speaker and their dad live. In this context, the correct pronoun to use would be "there."
0	The correct sentence would be: "Who is she trying to make up with now?" or "To whom is she trying to make up now?" The preposition "to" is not typically used after the phrase "make up with," and the sentence as written is not grammatically correct.
0	The correct sentence would be: "Wind was gotten of a plot to negotiate an honorable end to the Vietnam War." The word "Vietnam War" is a proper noun and should be capitalized.
0	The sentence is incorrect because the preposition "to" is incorrect in this context. It should be "with" instead of "to." The correct sentence would be: "Mike talked about politics yesterday with my friends."
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct. A passive voice is used in this sentence, so the subject is "The principal" and the object is "some teacher." To correct the sentence, it should be written as: "The reporters expected that the principal would fire some teachers."
0	The sentence is not correct because the pronoun "she" does not agree in gender with the name "Mike." To correct the sentence, one could change the pronoun to "he" or "they," or change the name to a feminine name.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and does not contain any errors.
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect. It should be "We donated wire for the convicts to build cages."
0	This sentence is not grammatically correct. It seems like there is a missing word or context. A possible correction could be: "I won't have some money until next week." or "I won't have any money."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and does not contain any errors.
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect. It should be: "I won't ask you to believe that he tried to force me to give him any money." The pronoun "her" does not agree with the antecedent "he."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and follows standard English syntax and usage.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and natural-sounding.
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect. It seems that the sentence is trying to convey that John is worried because the police want him, but Mary is not worried because the police want her. However, the sentence structure and use of pronouns are confusing and need to be revised for clarity.
0	The correct sentence would be: "I'll work on it if Sam is working on it." The original sentence uses a future tense verb ("will be working") in the condition part of the sentence, which is not correct in a sentence with "if."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and uses the correct verb conjugation and future tense.
0	This sentence is incorrect and should be: "Here's a knife for you to cut the onions with."
0	This sentence is grammatically incorrect. It should be "Fluffy is sick, which is not known by everybody." or "Not everybody knows that Fluffy is sick."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and expresses a complete thought.
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect due to the repetition of the conjunction "and". To fix the sentence, remove one of the "and" conjunctions: "The younger woman might have been tall, and the older one definitely was blond."
0	The comma after "blond" is missing, and the sentence structure is awkward.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and conveys a complete thought.
0	This sentence is incorrect. It contains a redundancy ("for for") and the phrase "to be planned" doesn't make sense in this context. A possible correction could be: "The socks are ready for you to put on as planned."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and makes sense.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and does not contain any errors.
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct. It seems to be missing a verb after the word "please." A possible correction could be: "My mother is easy to please, and my father is, too."

1	The sentence is grammatically correct and uses the correct verb form and tense.
1	The sentence is correct.
0	The sentence is not correct. It should be "Everybody around here who ever buys anything on credit talks in their sleep." The correct pronoun to use here is "their" to refer to everyone inclusively.
0	This sentence is not correct. The correct sentence would be: "I can't remember the name of someone who had misgivings." The word "someone" is the correct choice here because it is used to refer to an unspecified person.
0	The correct sentence should be: "No writer, nor any playwright, meets in Vienna." The word "nor" is more appropriate than "no" the second time to express a negative idea after another negative idea.
0	The correct sentence should be: "No writer, nor any playwright, meets in Vienna." The correction is due to the subject-verb agreement. The sentence is about multiple people (writer and playwright), so the verb should be in the plural form.
0	The sentence is not correct. The correct sentence would be: "That you will marry any student is uncertain." The word "uncertain" is the correct adjective to use in this context, meaning "not known for sure; unable to be relied on."
0	The sentence is not correct. It seems that the prepositional phrase "off the bench" modifies the verb "kicked" in a way that doesn't make sense. To correct the sentence, one could consider rephrasing it to clarify the intended meaning, such as "Felicia kicked the ball from the bench" or "Felicia kicked the ball while off the bench."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and uses the phrase "halfway around the world" idiomatically to describe the distance the package has traveled.

0	The sentence is incorrect. A possible correction could be: "Paperback books can be lifted onto the table easily." The original sentence lacks a subject, and the verb "lift" is not used correctly in this context.
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct. The verb "lifted" requires a subject that can perform the action of lifting. In this sentence, the subject is "books," which are inanimate objects and cannot lift themselves onto the table. The sentence should be corrected to include a person or entity performing the action, such as "I lifted the books onto the table."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and makes sense.

0	The sentence is incorrect because the verb "was" is singular, but the subject "many information" is plural. To correct the sentence, the verb should be changed to "were" to agree with the plural subject.
0	The word "advice" is a non-count noun in English. This means that it is not used in the plural form with numbers or quantifiers like "many." To correct the sentence, we can use a quantifier that is suitable for uncountable nouns, such as "a lot of." So, the correct sentence would be: "John offers a lot of advice."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and uses the comparative structure correctly.
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct. The correct sentence would be: "We recommend eating less cake and pastry." The verb "recommend" is followed by a noun or a gerund (-ing form of the verb), so "to eat" should be changed to "eating."
