1	Syntax	The sentence is already correct. It uses a passive construction, with the subject "The sailors" being acted upon by the verb phrase "rode the breeze clear of the rocks." The phrase "clear of the rocks" modifies the verb "rode" and describes the action of the sailors riding the breeze away from the rocks. The sentence has a clear subject-verb relationship and follows a logical structure, conveying a complete thought.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Semantics	The sentence is semantically correct. It conveys a meaningful idea and follows the subject-verb-object structure.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Semantics	The sentence is semantically correct. The phrase "wriggle loose" is often used to describe someone or something that is trying to break free from something that is holding them back.

0	Semantics	The sentence is semantically incorrect. The phrase "as you eat the most" suggests that the amount of food consumed is at its highest, while "you want the least" indicates a desire for a small amount or intensity of something. These two parts of the sentence contradict each other, and the overall meaning is confusing.	As you eat more, you want less.
0	Semantics	The sentence is semantically correct and expresses a coherent thought. The use of "the more" and "the less" indicates a inverse relationship between wanting and eating.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Morphology	The sentence is not correct because of the wrong use of the comparative form "more." When using "the more," the sentence must include a comparative adjective or adverb in the second clause.	I demand that the more John eats, the more he pays.

0	Semantics	The sentence is semantically incorrect. The use of "the more" at the beginning of the sentence requires a comparative structure, but the sentence instead uses a positive structure ("does Bill smoke").	The more Bill smokes, the more Susan hates him.
1	Semantics	The sentence is semantically correct and meaningful. The use of "the more... the more..." structure indicates a proportional relationship between the number of pictures of John appearing in the news and the degree of his embarrassment.	The sentence is already correct.

0	Syntax	The sentence is not syntactically correct because it uses the incorrect verb form "did" instead of the correct form "do." The correct sentence should be: "What the water does to the bottle is fill it."	What the water does to the bottle is fill it.
0	Semantics	The sentence is semantically incorrect because it uses the verb "fill" incorrectly. The verb "fill" is a transitive verb, which means it requires a direct object to complete its meaning. In this sentence, the direct object of "fill" is missing, which makes the sentence incomplete and unclear.	What the water did to the whole bottle was fill it with water.
0	Semantics	The sentence is semantically incorrect because the phrase "leaked free" suggests that the fluid was able to escape from the tank without any restrictions or obstacles, which is not the typical use of the word "leaked" and may confuse the reader.	The tank leaked the fluid freely.

1	Semantics	The sentence is semantically correct. The word "beautifully" describes how Mary plays the violin, and it is an appropriate adverb to use in this context.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Semantics	The sentence is semantically correct and meaningful. The use of "clearly" and "probably" together does not make the sentence incorrect, as they are both adverbs that modify the verb "will learn" and indicate different types of certainty. "Clearly" suggests that the speaker is certain about John's ability to learn French, while "probably" indicates a likelihood or chance that John will learn French. Additionally, the use of "immediately" and "perfectly" adds information about the time frame and the extent to which John will learn French, respectively. There is no contradiction or ambiguity in the sentence that makes it semantically incorrect. Category: Other Category can be used for any miscellaneous errors or issues that do not fall under the three main categories of syntax, semantics, and morphology.

0	Semantics	The sentence is semantically incorrect because the use of "did it" is ambiguous and can have multiple interpretations. It could be interpreted as Lilly doing the reading for José, or it could suggest that Lilly read the book for her own benefit or enjoyment. To clarify the meaning, the sentence should provide more context or use a more specific phrase.	I know which book José didn't read for class, and Lilly read that book for him.
0	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically incorrect. The phrase "won't do it" is not parallel to "reviewed" in the first part of the sentence, leading to a grammatical error.	This is the book which Bob reviewed, and this is the one which Fred won't review.

0	Semantics	The sentence is semantically incorrect because it contains a logical ambiguity. The phrase "which report" suggests that there is a specific report being referred to, but the sentence doesn't provide enough information to identify which report is being referenced. Additionally, the sentence is structured in a way that suggests that John submitted the report, which contradicts the idea that he was deemed incompetent.	The sentence is already correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is already syntactically correct. All the words are arranged in a way that makes sense and follows the rules of English grammar.	The sentence is already correct.
0	Semantics	The sentence is semantically incorrect because the use of "which" to describe the cats suggests that there is additional information about the cats that will be provided, but this does not happen in the rest of the sentence.	He let the whining cats out.

0	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically incorrect due to the incorrect use of the phrase "attributed to." The correct phrase would be "attributed to something."

0	Syntax	The sentence is syntactically incorrect. The subject-verb agreement is incorrect ("cats" as the subject should be paired with "are" as the verb).	Rescuing drowning cats, which is against the law, is hard.
1	Semantics	The sentence is semantically correct and has the correct meaning.	The sentence is already correct.

0	Morphology	The correct article for the word "proof" in this context is "a" since it is a countable noun. Also, the correct verb form for "is" in this context is "of," so the correct phrase would be "the proof of this set being recursive."	The proof of this set being recursive is difficult.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not syntactically correct. It contains a misplaced modifier, which makes the sentence ambiguous and difficult to understand. The phrase "which Henry plays the lute and sings" should be placed directly after "The madrigals" to clarify that it is the madrigals that Henry plays and sings, not the lute.	The madrigals that Henry plays and sings on the lute sound lousy.
0	Semantics	The sentence is semantically incorrect because there is a pronoun-referent disagreement. "These" refers to something that is close in proximity, while "those" refers to something that is farther away. In this sentence, "these grapes" is used to refer to the grapes that Tom picked, which implies that the speaker is close to those specific grapes. However, the sentence also mentions that Suzie will prepare "these grapes," which creates ambiguity because it is not clear if "these grapes" still refers to the grapes that Tom picked or if it now refers to a different set of grapes that are close to Suzie. To correct this sentence, you could use a different pronoun for Suzie's grapes or clarify which grapes are being referred to:	Tom picked these grapes, and I washed some turnips. Suzie will prepare those grapes.

0	Semantics	The sentence is semantically incorrect because the use of "it" in the sentence is ambiguous and can refer to either "the place" or "Route 150," leading to confusion about where the dad lives.	I live at the place where Route 150 crosses the Hudson River and my dad lives there too.
0	Semantics	The sentence is semantically incorrect because the phrase "make up to" is not typically used with the preposition "to" in this context. It should be used without a preposition, or a different phrase should be used to convey the intended meaning.	Who is she trying to make up with now?

We donated wire for zookeepers to build cages with.
