0	The sentence is not correct grammatically. It seems like there is a missing subject in the second clause, and the sentence structure is unclear.	As you eat the most, you desire the least.
0	This sentence is not grammatically correct. It seems like it's trying to convey the idea that wanting more of something results in eating less of it, but the construction is awkward and unclear.	The more you would want, the less you would consume.
0	The correct phrase should be "the more John eats." Here, the verb "eats" is in the singular present tense and agrees with the subject "John."	I demand that the more John eats, the more he pays.
0	The sentence is not correct because it is a run-on sentence, which means it contains two independent clauses that are not joined correctly.	Mary listens to the Grateful Dead, and it makes her depressed.
0	The sentence is not correct because the verb "got" is not in the correct form. The correct form of the verb is "get."	The angrier Mary got, the more she looked at pictures.

1	The sentence is already correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect because the pronoun "it" is used incorrectly. Pronouns must agree with their antecedents in number and gender. In this case, "it" is singular, while its antecedent (Mickey) is a proper noun referring to a person, so a third-person singular personal pronoun is needed.	Mickey looked it up.

1	The sentence is already correct.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is already correct.	The tub leaked water.
0	The sentence is incorrect because it uses the passive voice incorrectly. In this case, the passive voice requires the verb to be in the past participle form, so the correct verb form would be "filled" instead of "fill."	What the water did to the bottle was fill filling it.
0	The sentence is incorrect because the verb "fill" should be conjugated as "filled" to agree with the subject "water."	What the water did to the whole bottle was fill fill it.
0	This sentence is incorrect and does not make sense as it stands. It seems like there might be a missing word or context that would give it a clearer meaning.	The sentence needs more context or additional words to make sense. One possible correction could be: "The tank leaked the fluid freely."
0	The sentence is incorrect because the verb "lay" is used incorrectly in this context. The correct verb to use here is "laid," which is the past tense of "to lay."	John laid the ball in the box.

1	The sentence is already correct.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is already correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence is not correct grammatically. The phrase "represented ... to the dean" is not typically used this way and sounds awkward. A better phrase would be "introduced" or "presented."	They introduced Mary to the dean as a serious and genuine linguist.
0	The sentence is incorrect because the pronoun "us" is not used correctly. In the subjective case (when it's the subject of a sentence or clause), the first-person personal pronoun should be "we," not "us."	We love them.

0	The sentence is incorrect because the verb tense is inconsistent. The correct verb phrase should be "I also want to read."	John wants to read Fred's story, and I also want to read it.
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect. The correct phrase should be "We wanted to invite someone, but we couldn't decide whom to invite." The word "who" is subjective and used for the subject of a clause, while "whom" is objective and used for the object of a verb or preposition. In this sentence, "whom" is the correct choice because it is the object of the preposition "to."	We wanted to invite someone, but we couldn't decide whom to invite.
1	The sentence is already correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	This sentence is incorrect and needs to be restructured for better clarity.	Mary claimed that Holly shouldn't eat cabbage.

1	The sentence is already correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence is incorrect because the verb "does" is singular and does not agree with the plural subject "neuroses."	Joe's neuroses bother his patrons, and so does Sally.
0	The sentence is incorrect because the verb "did" is incomplete and needs to be followed by a verb in the ing form to make sense in this context.	I know which book Jos√© didn't read for class, and which book Lilly did read for him.
0	The sentence is not correct because of the incorrect use of pronouns. The phrase "won't do it" is not grammatically consistent with the rest of the sentence.	This is the book that Bob reviewed, and this is the one that Fred won't review.
0	The sentence is incorrect because of the incorrect use of the verb "read." The correct form should be "read" instead of "read" as the verb is in the past tense.	I know which book Mag read, and which book Bob said that you hadn't read.
0	The sentence is incorrect and needs to be rewritten for better clarity and grammar.	I know which book Mag read and which book Bob read my report that I hadn't read.
0	The correct sentence should be "I'm sure I would like him to eat fruit more than cookies." The word "to" after "like" is not necessary and sounds awkward in this context.	I'm sure I would like him to eat fruit more than cookies.
0	The correct form of this sentence should be "Rusty talked about himself only after Mary had talked about him." The auxiliary verb "had" is used to form the past perfect tense of "to talk," indicating that Mary's action of talking about Rusty occurred before Rusty's action of talking about himself.	Rusty talked about himself only after Mary had talked about him.
0	The sentence is not correct because of the incorrect use of verb tenses. In a sentence with multiple clauses, the past tense should be used consistently.	Fred talked about everything before Rusty talked about something.
1	The sentence is already correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	This sentence is not correct grammatically. The verb "perceive" is transitive, which means it needs an object. In this case, the object would explain what the problem perceives.	The problem is easily perceived.
1	The sentence is already correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect because it uses the first-person pronoun "me" as the object of the verb "elected," which requires a subject pronoun. In this case, the correct pronoun to use would be "I."	We elected I.
0	The sentence is a grammatical but nonsensical question. It seems to be missing a subject or context that would clarify who "he" is and what report is being referred to.	The sentence needs more context to be grammatically correct and meaningful. It could be corrected by adding information about the subject, such as: "Which report that labeled John as incompetent did he submit?"
1	The sentence is already correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence is not correct because of the wrong relative pronoun usage. The correct relative pronoun to use here is "that" instead of "which."	He let the cats that were whining out.

0	This sentence is grammatically incorrect. It seems to be missing a word or has a word out of place, as the structure is not correct.	A proof that the claim had been made was given: John had lied.
0	The sentence is not correct because of the incorrect use of the passive voice and the preposition "to."	He attributed the fire that destroyed most of my factory to a short circuit caused by an overloaded transducer.
0	The sentence is not correct because the verb "regarded" is not used correctly in this context. The correct phrase would be "regarded as."	The mayor regarded it as absurd that the proposal was to build a sidewalk from Dartmouth to Smith.
0	The correct sentence should be "I want it to remain a secret that Bill left." The original sentence is incorrect because the word "that" should come before the phrase "Bill left" to make the sentence grammatically correct and clear.	I want it to remain a secret that Bill left.
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect. The phrase "as drives" is not correct and needs to be rephrased for clarity.	I know a man whom Tom drives just as he drives himself.
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect. The phrase "drowning cats" is a noun phrase that serves as the subject of the sentence, and it is being described as "against the law." However, the present participle phrase "are hard to rescue" does not agree with the subject.	Rescuing drowning cats, which is against the law, is hard.
1	The sentence is already correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence is incorrect. The reflexive pronoun "himself" should not be used here because it refers back to the subject of the sentence, "Rutherford." Instead, the correct pronoun to use in this sentence would be "he."	Rutherford understands him.
1	The sentence is already correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The correct article for the word "proof" in this context is "the" because it is referring to a specific proof. Additionally, the correct verb form of "to be" in the present tense is "is" instead of "are."	The proof that this set is recursive is difficult.
0	The sentence is not correct because of the word order issue. It should be either "The madrigals that Henry plays on the lute and sings sound lousy" or "The madrigals that Henry plays and sings on the lute sound lousy."	The madrigals that Henry plays on the lute and sings sound lousy.
0	The sentence is incorrect because of the ambiguous use of "these." The use of "these" in the first clause refers to the grapes that Tom picked, but the use of "these" in the third clause is unclear if it refers to the grapes or the turnips. To correct this sentence, we need to clarify the reference of "these" in the third clause.	Tom picked these grapes, and I washed some turnips, and Suzie will prepare these turnips/grapes.
1	The sentence is already correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect. It contains incorrect use of apostrophes and a misplaced modifier.	Which boy's employer did we elect as the guardians' president?
0	The sentence is not correct because the word "sane" is an adjective and needs a copula (a linking verb) before it.	How sane is Peter?
0	The sentence is incorrect because of the use of the word "too" at the end. The word "too" is used to indicate that something is also the case or is also true, and it should be used after a sentence or clause that it modifies. In this sentence, the use of "too" is not grammatically correct as it does not relate to the information that is being conveyed.	I live at the place where Route 150 crosses the River, and my dad lives at the place where Route 150 crosses the Hudson River, too.
0	This sentence is incorrect because the pronoun "it" is ambiguous and does not clearly refer to a specific location.	I live at the place where Route 150 crosses the Hudson River and my dad lives there too.
0	The correct phrase is "make up with," not "make up to." The preposition "with" is used after "make up" to indicate reconciliation or reaching an agreement with someone.	Who is she trying to make up with now?
0	The sentence is not correct grammatically. The verb "get" is used incorrectly in this sentence. A correct phrase could be "was aware of."	Wind was aware of a plot to negotiate an honorable end to the war in Vietnam.
0	The sentence is not correct because the preposition "to" is incorrect in this context. The preposition "to" is typically used when the object of the preposition is a person or a group of people, and it often indicates movement or direction toward someone. In this sentence, "my friends" are the object of the preposition, but the sentence is describing a situation where Mike talked about politics to them, not toward them or in their direction.	Mike talked about politics with my friends yesterday.
0	The sentence is not correct because the use of the passive voice makes it awkward and unclear.	The reporters expected that the principal would fire some teachers.
0	The sentence is not correct because the verb "quip" requires a subject that is typically a person, but "which hat" is not a person.	Which hat did Mike quip she never wore?
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct. It seems like there might be a missing word or words that would clarify the sentence, as it currently sounds incomplete and awkward.	This sentence cannot be corrected without additional context or information to clarify the intended meaning.
0	This sentence is incorrect because the preposition "for" should be followed by a gerund, which is a verb form that ends in "ing" and functions as a noun. In this case, the correct word to use would be "building."	We donated wire for the convicts to build cages with.
0	This sentence is not correct grammatically. The correct phrase should be "I won't have any money." The word "some" is incorrect in this context.	I won't have any money.
1	The sentence is already correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence is incorrect because the pronouns "I," "he," and "her" are confusing and ambiguous. It is not clear who is performing each action in the sentence.	I won't ask you to believe that he tried to force me to give him money.
1	The sentence is already correct.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is already correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence is incorrect due to a subject-verb agreement error. The singular noun "John" should be paired with the singular verb "worried," but the sentence uses the plural verb "worry" instead.	That the fuzz wanted him worried John, but that the fuzz wanted her didn't worry Mary.
0	The sentence is not correct because it uses two different verb tenses: "will work" and "will be working." To correct the sentence, the verb tenses should be consistent.	I'll work on it if Sam works on it, too.
1	The sentence is already correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	This sentence is incorrect because the prepositions "with" and "for" should not be used together in this context.	Here's a knife for you to cut up the onions with.
0	This sentence is a comma splice, which is a sentence that contains two independent clauses (complete thoughts that can stand alone as sentences) joined only by a comma. In this case, the two independent clauses are "Fluffy is sick" and "which not everybody knows." To correct this error, a conjunction or a semicolon is needed before the comma.	Fluffy is sick, and not everybody knows.
1	The sentence is already correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	This sentence is incorrect due to the repetition of the conjunction "and."	The younger woman might have been tall, and the older one definitely was blond.
0	This sentence has a few issues. Firstly, the comma after "blond" is unnecessary and should be removed. Secondly, the verb "be" is missing after "may" and "is" in the phrase "may be blond" and "is, blond." Finally, there should be a comma after "tall" to set off the appositive phrase "and may be blond."	Sally is tall and may be blond, and Sheila is short and definitely is blond.
1	The sentence is already correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	This sentence contains redundant words ("for" is repeated, and "to be planned" doesn't make sense in this context) and doesn't sound natural.	The socks are ready for you to put on.

1	The sentence is already correct.	The sentence is already correct.

0	The sentence is not correct and has a syntax error. The correct sentence would be: "That the cops spoke to the janitor about that robbery yesterday is terrible."	That the cops spoke to the janitor about that robbery yesterday is terrible.
0	The given sentence is not correct grammatically. The correct conjunction to use in this sentence is "who" instead of "and" because it is a restrictive clause.	Every student who wears socks is a swinger.
0	The sentence is incorrect because the word "my" is incorrect in this context. The sentence suggests that the binoculars belong to the person speaking, so the correct pronoun to use would be "me".	That girl was given my binoculars by him.
1	The sentence is already correct.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is already correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The correct relative pronoun to use in this sentence is "whoever" because it is referring to people in general and is the subject of the clause "whoever buys anything on credit."	Everybody around here who ever buys anything on credit talks in their sleep.
0	This sentence is incorrect. The correct phrase is "I can't remember somebody's name."	I can't remember somebody's name.
0	The sentence is incorrect because of the subject-verb disagreement. When compound subjects are joined by "and," they are treated as plural, so the correct verb form to use is "meet."	No writer, and no playwright, meet in Vienna.
0	The sentence is incorrect because of the incorrect use of the conjunctive adverb "nor." When using "nor," the sentence structure should be: "Neither [noun phrase] nor [noun phrase] [verb]." In this case, the sentence should be structured as "Neither [noun phrase] nor [noun phrase] meets in Vienna."	Neither writer nor any playwright meets in Vienna.
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect. It seems like a confusion between "any student" and "any other student."	That you will marry any other student is not certain.
0	This sentence is incorrect and ambiguous. It can be interpreted in two ways: either Felicia kicked the ball while she was on the bench, or she kicked the ball in such a way that it went off the bench.	The sentence needs more context to be corrected. It could be corrected as: "Felicia, who was sitting on the bench, kicked the ball." or "Felicia kicked the ball, sending it off the bench."

0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect. The correct preposition to use with "forgive" in this context is "for" rather than "to."	No one can forgive that comment for you.
0	The phrase "blew up" in this context typically means "exploded." However, the sentence is incorrect because "blew up" can also mean "became angry," which is not the intended meaning here. To avoid ambiguity, a more precise word choice is necessary.	We launched the rocket toward the moon, but it exploded before reaching its destination.
1	The sentence is already correct.	The sentence is already correct.

0	This sentence is incorrect because the phrase "differ apart" is redundant and not grammatically correct.

0	This sentence is incorrect and nonsensical as a dog trying to bite itself does not make sense.

That dog is so ferocious that it tried to bite anyone nearby.
0	The sentence is incorrect because the reflexive pronoun "yourself" should not be used as the object of a sentence when the subject is someone else.	He washed himself.
0	The sentence is not correct because the object of the verb "please" is missing. It should be either "John is easy to please" or "John is easy for Kim to please."	John is easy to please or John is easy for Kim to please.

The subjunctive mood is used in the "if" clause of a hypothetical situation that is contrary to fact. In this case, the speaker is not actually a rich man, so the subjunctive "were" is appropriate. Additionally, the correct form of the auxiliary verb for the main clause is "would" to maintain consistency in the hypothetical tone.	If I were a rich man, I would buy a diamond ring.

0	This sentence is not correct because of the subject-verb disagreement between "Bill" and "did." To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the verb agrees with the singular subject "Bill."	Tom said he would, and Bill actually did, eat a raw eggplant.

0	This sentence is not correct because it contains a grammatical error. The phrase "the idea" is a noun phrase that functions as the subject of the sentence, but it is not the subject of the verb "dismayed." This is known as a "dangling modifier." To correct the sentence, we need to ensure that the subject of the sentence is performing the action of the verb.	The idea of the Dome being dull dismayed the Prime Minister.

0	This sentence is incorrect and has a few issues. Firstly, the verb "alienated" is not used correctly in this context and should be changed to "alienates."

In this sentence, "the paper" is the object and "Mary" is the subject. To correct the sentence, we need to change the structure to make "the paper" the subject and "Mary" the agent.	The paper is cut by Mary.
