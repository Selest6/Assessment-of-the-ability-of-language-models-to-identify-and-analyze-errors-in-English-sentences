0	Semantics	The sentence is semantically incorrect because the use of the phrase "computed my tax" suggests that the man was involved in calculating the tax for the person speaking or writing the sentence, which is not the typical use of the phrase "my tax." A more typical phrase would be "he computed his tax" or "he computed her tax." Additionally, the sentence is ambiguous because it is not clear if "computed" is being used as a transitive verb (taking a direct object) or an intransitive verb (not taking a direct object). If "computed" is transitive, then the sentence is missing a direct object and is syntactically incorrect. If "computed" is intransitive, then the sentence is grammatically correct but still semantically odd because it suggests that the man's action of computing something (his tax or someone else's tax) is being emphasized, which is not a common way to use the word "compute" in this context.	The man who Mary loves and Sally hates, computed his tax.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not syntactically correct due to the incorrect use of the relative pronoun "which."

0	Semantics	The word "omnipotent" means "all-powerful," and it is typically used to describe a supreme being or deity. In this sentence, "omnipotent" is used to describe Aphrodite, who is a Greek goddess of love, beauty, pleasure, and procreation. While Aphrodite is a goddess and possesses powers, she is not typically considered to be omnipotent in the traditional sense. The use of the word "omnipotent" to describe Aphrodite may be seen as inaccurate or inappropriate to some, as it could suggest that she holds unlimited power and control over all aspects of existence, which is not typically associated with her character in Greek mythology.	The sentence is already correct in terms of syntax, morphology, and grammar, but it may be inappropriate or inaccurate in terms of semantics depending on the context and the speaker's intention.
