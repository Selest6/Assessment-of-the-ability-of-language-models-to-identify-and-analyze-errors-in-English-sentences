0	The sentence is not grammatically correct. The correct sentence would be: "John laid the ball in the box." The verb "lay" is transitive and requires a direct object, but in this sentence, it is used as an intransitive verb, which is incorrect.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and makes sense.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and makes sense contextually.
0	This sentence is incorrect and should be structured as follows: "Most people probably consider Klaus guilty of murder, even though the courts didn't actually find him guilty." The original sentence is missing the word "him" after "guilty," which is necessary because the verb "find" requires an object.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and uses the word "beautifully" as an adverb to describe how Mary plays the violin.

1	The sentence is grammatically correct and expresses a future intention in a conditional form.
0	The sentence is incorrect because it is ambiguous and can have two different meanings. It can be interpreted as either Sally is also bothered by Joe's neuroses, or Sally is also a source of bother to Joe's patrons. To correct the sentence and convey the first interpretation, it can be rewritten as, "Joe's neuroses bother his patrons, and so does Sally." To convey the second interpretation, it can be rewritten as, "Joe's neuroses and Sally bother his patrons."
0	The sentence is not correct. It should be: "I know which book José didn't read for class and which book Lilly read for him."
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct. It should be: "This is the book which Bob reviewed, and this is the one which Fred won't review." or "This is the book Bob reviewed, and Fred won't review this one."
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect. It seems like the sentence is trying to convey that the speaker knows which book Mag read and which book Bob claimed the listener hadn't read. However, the way it is currently structured, the sentence lacks a clear subject and is not grammatically coherent. To correct it, one possible revision could be: "I know which book Mag read and which book Bob said you hadn't read."
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect and needs to be rewritten for clarity. It seems to be trying to convey that the speaker knows which books Mag and Bob read, specifically the books that the listener hadn't read the speaker's report in. A correct version could be: "I know which books Mag and Bob read—the ones you hadn't read my report in."
0	The correct sentence would be: "I'm sure I would like him to eat fruit more than cookies." The word "to" before "eat" is unnecessary and makes the sentence sound awkward.
0	The correct sentence would be: "Rusty talked about himself only after Mary had talked about him." The auxiliary verb "did" is incorrect in this context and should be replaced with "had." Additionally, the word order in the second part of the sentence is incorrect; it should be "talked about him" instead of "talk about him."
0	The sentence is not correct. It should be: "Fred talked about everything before Rusty talked about something." The correct sentence uses the past tense "talked" for both "Fred" and "Rusty" to maintain consistency in the sentence structure.

1	The sentence is grammatically correct and uses the correct structure for expressing preference between two things.
0	The sentence is not correct. Relative clauses beginning with "which" refer to animals as things and are used only for things. Relative clauses beginning with "who" refer to animate beings. The correct sentence should be: "He let the cats out, which were whining."
1	The sentence is correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and adheres to the standard rules of English syntax and structure.

0	The sentence is not correct. Here is the corrected version: "The mayor regarded the proposal to build a sidewalk from Dartmouth to Smith as being absurd."
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect. The correct sentence would be: "I want that Bill's leaving remain a secret." or "I want Bill to leave and keep it a secret." The sentence as given has a subject-verb disagreement and is not a typical construction in English.
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct. It seems like it's trying to use a construction like "I know a man who drives like Tom drives," but the current structure is incorrect.
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct. Here is the corrected version: "Rescuing drowning cats, which is against the law, is hard." The original sentence uses the incorrect verb form "are" instead of "is" and places the subject "cats" after the verb, leading to an ungrammatical construction.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and does not contain any errors.
0	The sentence is not correct. The correct sentence would be: "Rutherford understands himself." The word "himself" is a reflexive pronoun and should be used when the subject and the object of a sentence are the same. In this case, "himself" is not the subject of the sentence, so it is not correct to use it.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and expresses the speaker's belief that someone named Arch will arrive or "show up."
0	The correct sentence would be: "The proof that this set is recursive is difficult." or "Proving that this set is recursive is difficult." The original sentence is missing the word "that" or needs to be rephrased to maintain proper grammar.
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct. It seems like it's trying to say that Henry plays the lute and sings madrigals, but the way it's currently structured is not correct. To fix it, one way would be to say: "Henry's performances of madrigals, where he plays the lute and sings, sound lousy."
0	The sentence is incorrect. The correct sentence would be: "Tom picked these grapes, and I washed some turnips, and Suzie will prepare them." The pronoun "them" refers to both "these grapes" and "some turnips," making the sentence grammatically consistent and clear.
1	The sentence is correct and follows the subject-verb-object structure. It is a valid question and does not require correction.
0	The correct sentence would be: "Which boy's employer did we elect guardian president?"
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct. It seems to be missing a verb. A possible correction could be: "How sane is Peter behaving?" or "How sane does Peter seem?"
0	This sentence is incorrect because of the use of the word "too" at the end. The word "too" is used to indicate that something is also true or also the case, but in this sentence, it is not needed because the sentence already mentions that both the speaker and their dad live at the place where Route 150 crosses the Hudson River. Removing "too" at the end of the sentence would make it correct.
0	The sentence is incorrect and should be: "I live at the place where Route 150 crosses the Hudson River, and my dad lives there too." Using "it" as a pronoun to refer to a place is not grammatically correct in this context.
0	The correct sentence would be: "Who is she trying to make up with now?" The phrase "make up with someone" means to reconcile or restore a good relationship with that person.
0	The correct sentence would be: "Wind was gotten of a plot to negotiate an honorable end to the Vietnam War." The word "Vietnam War" is a proper noun and should be capitalized.
0	The sentence is incorrect because the preposition "to" is incorrect in this context. It should be "with" instead of "to." The correct sentence would be: "Mike talked about politics yesterday with my friends."
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct. A passive voice is used in this sentence, which makes it awkward and unclear. To correct the sentence, it can be rewritten in the active voice: "The reporters expected that the principal would fire some teachers."
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct. To correct the sentence, the pronoun "she" should be replaced with "he" to agree with the antecedent "Mike." Here is the corrected version: "Which hat did Mike quip that he never wore?"
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and does not contain any errors.
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect. It should be "We donated wire for the convicts to build cages."

1	The sentence is grammatically correct and follows standard English syntax and usage.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and natural-sounding.
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect. It seems that the sentence is trying to convey that John is worried because the police want him, but Mary is not worried because the police want her. However, the sentence structure and use of pronouns are confusing and need to be revised for clarity.
0	The correct sentence would be: "I'll work on it if Sam is working on it." The original sentence uses the future tense "will be working," which is not correct in this context. The correct form is the present continuous tense "is working" because it refers to an ongoing action or a future arrangement.
1	The sentence is correct.
0	The sentence is incorrect. It should be: "Here's a knife for you to cut the onions with."
0	This sentence is grammatically incorrect. It should be "Fluffy is sick, which is not known by everybody." or "Not everybody knows that Fluffy is sick."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and expresses a complete thought.
0	The sentence is incorrect because of the repetition of the word "and". The correct sentence would be: "The younger woman might have been tall, and the older one definitely was blond."
0	The comma after "blond" is missing, and the sentence structure is incorrect. Also, the correct adjective form of "blond" for a woman is "blonde." The corrected sentence would be: "Sally is tall and may be blonde, and Sheila is short and definitely blonde."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and expresses a coherent thought.
0	This sentence is incorrect. The phrase "to be planned" doesn't fit in this context. It should be "The socks are ready for you to put on."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and makes sense.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and does not contain any errors.
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct. It seems like there is a missing verb after "father." Also, the sentence structure could be improved for clarity. Here's a corrected version: "It is easy to please my mother and father."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and does not contain any errors.

0	This sentence is not grammatically correct. A possible correction could be: "I can't remember the name of someone who had misgivings." The word "someone" is generally preferred over "somebody" in modern English usage, especially in formal writing.
0	The correct sentence should be: "No writer, nor any playwright, meets in Vienna." The word "nor" is more appropriate than "no" the second time to express a negative idea after another negative idea.
0	The correct sentence should be: "No writer, nor any playwright, meets in Vienna." The sentence as it stands is incorrect because the verb "meet" should be singular to agree with the singular subjects "writer" and "playwright."
0	The correct sentence is "That you will marry any student is uncertain." The word "uncertain" means that something is not definite or sure. In this sentence, "uncertain" is used to describe the likelihood of the person marrying any student. The sentence as it stands suggests that it is definite that the person will not marry any student, which may not be the intended meaning.
0	The sentence is incorrect because the prepositional phrase "off the bench" suggests that the ball was on the bench, and Felicia kicked it from there. However, the sentence can be interpreted as Felicia, who was sitting on the bench, kicked the ball. To make the sentence clearer, it can be rewritten as, "Felicia kicked the ball from the bench."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and uses the phrase "halfway around the world" idiomatically to describe the distance the package has traveled.

1	The sentence is grammatically correct and uses proper syntax and punctuation.

0	The sentence is incorrect. The correct phrase is "Paperback books can be lifted onto the table easily." or "You can lift paperback books onto the table easily."
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct. The verb "lifted" requires a subject that can perform the action of lifting. In this sentence, the subject is "books," which are inanimate objects and cannot lift themselves onto the table. The sentence should be corrected to include a person or entity performing the action, such as "I lifted the books onto the table."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and makes sense.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and makes sense.

1	The sentence is grammatically correct and adheres to the subject-verb-object sentence structure.
0	The sentence is not correct. The subject "packages" is singular, but the verb "drive" is plural. The correct form of the verb should be "drives" to agree with the singular subject.
0	This sentence is not grammatically correct. It seems to be missing a subject or an object. To correct it, we need more context. If we are referring to the chair being pushed by someone, the sentence would be: "The chair was pushed."
