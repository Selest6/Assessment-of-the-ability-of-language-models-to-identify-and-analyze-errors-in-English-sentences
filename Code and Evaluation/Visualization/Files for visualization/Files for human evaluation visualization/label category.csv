Mickey looked up it.,0,"Syntax The sentence ""Mickey looked up it"" contains a syntax error because the pronoun ""it"" needs to come before the verb ""looked up."" A corrected version would be ""Mickey looked it up.""",1,
"We wanted to invite someone, but we couldn't decide who to.",0,"Syntax The sentence contains a syntactic error. The pronoun ""who"" does not have an appropriate antecedent. A corrected version could be: ""We wanted to invite someone, but we couldn't decide who to invite.""",1,
"This is the book which Bob reviewed, and this is the one which Fred won't do it.",0,"Syntax The second clause ""and this is the one which Fred won't do it"" contains a syntactic error. The verb ""do"" requires an object or complement for completion, but there isn't any in this case. It would be better to rephrase the sentence as follows: This is the book which Bob reviewed, and this is the one which Fred won't do (something) with it.",1,
Which report that John was incompetent did he submit?,0,"Syntax Explanation: The sentence contains a misplaced relative pronoun ""that."" A correct version could be: ""Which report did he submit regarding John's incompetence?"" or ""He submitted a report stating that John was incompetent.""",1,
A proof that the claim had been. made was giver that John had lied.,0,"Syntax The sentence contains a grammatical error in the last word. It should be ""given,"" not ""giver."" The correct sentence would be: ""A proof that the claim had been made was given because John had lied.""",1,
The mayor regarded as being absurd the proposal to build a sidewalk from Dartmouth to Smith.,0,"Syntax The sentence contains an error in its syntax. Specifically, there's no verb linking ""the mayor"" and ""regarded."" A corrected version would be: ""The mayor regarded the proposal to build a sidewalk from Dartmouth to Smith as absurd.""",1,
"Drowning cats, which is against the law, are hard to rescue.",0,"Syntax Explanation: The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in this sentence. ""Drowning cats"" is a plural noun but it is paired with the singular verb form ""is."" To fix this error, change ""which is"" to ""which are,"" so the corrected sentence reads: ""Drowning cats, which are against the law, are hard to rescue.""",1,"Syntax, Semantics"
Which boy's did we elect guardian's employer president?,0,"Syntax Explanation: The sentence contains a misplaced possessive pronoun 'his'. A possible corrected version could be ""Which boy's employer as guardian's president did we elect?"" or ""Whose employer as guardian's president did we elect among the boys?""",1,
Wind was gotten of a plot to negotiate an honorable end to the war in Vietnam.,0,"Syntax The sentence contains several errors in subject-verb agreement and word choice. The corrected version would be: ""A wind had arisen from a plot to negotiate an honorable end to the war in Vietnam."" Here's why: * ""Wind"" should be changed to ""a wind,"" because we need an article before it as the subject of the sentence. * ""was gotten"" should be replaced by ""had arisen,"" since ""wind"" here means something more like ""gust"" or ""breeze"". Also, ""getten"" is archaic and no longer used. * A verb tense shift occurs between past simple (""arose"") and past perfect continuous (""had been getting""), so I chose past perfect for consistency.",1,
Which hat did Mike quip that she never wore?,0,"Syntax The sentence contains a pronoun error. The pronoun ""she"" does not agree with the antecedent ""Mike."" It should be ""he"" instead. Additionally, there is a missing article before ""quip,"" making it ""a quip"" or simply ""the quip"" if it has been previously referred to. So the corrected sentence would be: Which hat did Mike quip that he never wore?",1,
I won't have some money.,0,"Syntax The sentence ""I won't have some money"" is syntactically incorrect because it uses a double negative (""won't"" and ""some""), which creates confusion and makes the meaning unclear. The corrected version could be either ""I won't have any money"" or ""I'll have some money,"" depending on the intended meaning.",1,
Here's a knife with which for you to cut up the onions.,0,"Syntax The sentence contains a misplaced word, specifically the preposition ""with."" The proper phrasing would be ""Here's a knife for you to cut up the onions with."" This error falls under syntax as it involves the arrangement of words within a sentence.",1,
"The younger woman might have been tall and, and the older one definitely was, blond.",0,"Syntax Explanation: The sentence contains a repeated conjunction ""and"" after ""tall"", making it grammatically incorrect. A corrected version would be: ""The younger woman might have been tall and blonde, while the older one definitely was.""",1,
The socks are ready for for you to put on to be planned.,0,"Syntax The sentence contains a redundancy error with the word ""for"". A corrected version could be: ""The socks are ready for you to put on to plan."" However, even after removing the redundancy, there's still a problem because ""to plan"" doesn't make sense here. Maybe what was intended was something like: ""The socks are ready for you to wear when you get dressed."", or simply: ""The socks are ready for you.""",1,"Syntax, Semantics"
My mother is easy to please my father and.,0,"Syntax The sentence ""My mother is easy to please my father and"" contains a syntax error because there is no conjunction or proper punctuation connecting the two clauses ""My mother is easy to please"" and ""my father."" A corrected version could be either ""My mother is easy to please; my father as well,"" or ""My mother is easy to please, and so is my father.""",1,
The farmer dumped the cart with apples.,0,"Syntax The sentence ""The farmer dumped the cart with apples"" is syntactically incorrect because it does not specify what was done with the apples. A possible correction could be ""The farmer dumped the cart full of apples.""",1,
Sharon came the room.,0,"Syntax The sentence ""Sharon came the room"" is grammatically incorrect because it lacks a preposition such as ""into"" or ""to."" The corrected version would be ""Sharnon came into the room"" or ""Sharon came to the room,"" depending on context.",1,
The books lifted onto the table.,0,"Syntax The sentence ""The books lifted onto the table"" is syntactically incorrect because it lacks a main verb. It seems as though there might be missing information about who or what was lifting the books. Additionally, if we assume that ""lifted"" is meant to be the past tense of the verb ""lift,"" then it would need to agree in number with its subject, so we would expect ""book"" instead of ""books.""",1,"Syntax, Semantics"
Lora buttered at the toast.,0,"Syntax Explanation: In standard English, we say ""Lora butterered the toast"" instead of ""Lora buttered at the toast"". The preposition 'at' is incorrect here as it does not fit grammatically with the verb 'butter'.",1,
A job offered.,0,"Syntax The sentence ""A job offered"" is grammatically incorrect because it lacks a finite verb. In order for the sentence to be complete and meaningful, we need to add a verb such as ""was."" The corrected sentence would read: ""A job was offered.""",1,"Syntax, Semantics"
This flyer and that flyer differ apart.,0,"Syntax The error in this sentence is related to syntax, which pertains to the arrangement of words to create meaningful sentences. Specifically, there's a problem with the phrase ""differ apart."" The verb ""differ"" implies comparison between two things, so using ""apart"" as an adverbial modifier here is incorrect. A more appropriate way to express this idea would be: ""This flyer and that flyer differ from each other.""",1,
The children amused.,0,"Syntax The issue with this sentence lies in its syntax, specifically subject-verb agreement. In English, a verb must agree in number (singular or plural) with its subject. Here, the subject ""the children"" is plural but the verb ""amuses"" is singular. Changing the verb to its plural form (""amuse"") would make the sentence grammatically correct.",1,
many information was provided.,0,"Syntax The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in this sentence. The verb ""was"" does not agree with its plural subject ""information."" It should be ""were"" instead. Therefore, the corrected sentence would be: ""Many pieces of information were provided.""",1,
John offers many advice.,0,"Syntax The sentence ""John offers many advice"" contains a syntax error. The noun ""advice"" is uncountable, so it cannot be modified by a number such as ""many."" A correct version of the sentence would be ""John offers much advice.""",1,
Some my jobs are in jeopardy.,0,"Syntax The error in this sentence is a subject-verb agreement problem. The subject of the sentence is ""some,"" which requires a singular verb. Therefore, the correct form of the verb would be ""is"" instead of ""are."" Here's how it looks with the correction made: Corrected Sentence: Some of my jobs is in jeopardy. (This still doesn't sound quite right because we usually don't say ""jobs is."") A better way to phrase the original idea might be: Some of my positions are in danger.",1,
It was the policeman met that several young students in the park last night.,0,"Syntax The sentence contains a misplaced modifier error. The phrase ""that several young students in the park last night"" incorrectly modifies ""the policeman."" To fix this error, we could rewrite the sentence as follows: Correct Sentence: Last night, a policeman met several young students in the park.",1,
Kim depends for Sandy.,0,"Syntax The sentence ""Kim depends for Sandy"" is grammatically incorrect because it uses a preposition (""for"") where a verb or adjective is expected after ""depends"". A possible correction could be ""Kim depends on Sandy"", if the intended meaning was that Kim relies on Sandy for something.",1,
That Fred was unpopular nominated Bill.,0,"Syntax The sentence ""That Fred was unpopular nominated Bill"" is grammatically incorrect due to issues with syntax. Specifically, there needs to be a verb connecting ""unpopular"" and ""nominated."" A possible correction could be ""That Fred, being unpopular, nominated Bill,"" or simply separating them into two sentences such as ""Fred was unpopular. He nominated Bill.""",1,
John paid me against the book.,0,"Semantics The sentence ""John paid me against the book"" is grammatically correct but semantically incorrect because it's unclear what it means for someone to pay money ""against"" a book. A more appropriate way to phrase this idea might be ""John paid me instead of buying the book,"" or ""John gave me money rather than taking the book.""",0,Syntax
Students studying English reads Conrad's Heart of Darkness while at university.,0,"Syntax Explanation: The verb form used for the subject ""students"" should be plural as well. Therefore, it should be ""read"" instead of ""studies."" Here is the corrected version: ""Students studying English read Conrad's Heart of Darkness while at university.""",1,
I drank some of water.,0,"Syntax The error in this sentence lies in syntax, or the arrangement of words to create meaningful phrases and sentences. Specifically, there is a missing article before ""water."" The corrected sentence would be ""I drank some of the water"" or simply ""I drank some water.""",1,
It tries to leave the country.,0,"Syntax The sentence ""It tries to leave the country."" is syntactically incorrect because it lacks a clear subject-verb agreement. The pronoun ""it"" implies that there is a singular subject performing the action of trying, but the verb ""tries"" suggests plurality. To fix the issue, we could change the subject or modify the verb accordingly, such as ""He tries to leave the country,"" or ""They try to leave the country.""",0,Semantics
John will rain tomorrow.,0,"Syntax The sentence ""John will rain tomorrow"" is grammatically incorrect because it violates subject-verb agreement rule. The verb 'rain' is an impersonal verb which cannot be used with a specific subject such as 'John'.",0,Semantics
A pound was weighed by the book.,0,"Syntax The sentence ""A pound was weighed by the book"" contains a mistake in its syntax. The word ""pound"" is being used as both a unit of weight and a noun referring to something being weighed, leading to confusion about what is actually being weighed. Additionally, it's unclear who or what is doing the weighing since ""the book"" cannot typically be used to refer to someone or something performing an action. To fix these issues, the sentence could be rewritten as follows: ""The book weighed a pound.""",1,"Syntax, Semantics"
Fed knows which politician her to vote for.,0,"Syntax The sentence ""Fed knows which politician her to vote for"" contains a syntax error because there is no clear subject or verb for the pronoun ""her."" It's unclear who ""her"" refers to, and it doesn't make sense grammatically as written. A possible correction could be ""Fed knows which politician she wants to vote for,"" where ""she"" is clearly referring to someone specific (even if we don't know who that person is).",1,
Who achieved the best result was Angela.,0,"Syntax The sentence contains a misplaced modifier error. The phrase ""who achieved the best result"" is modifying the subject ""Angela,"" but it is placed after the verb ""was."" To fix this error, move the phrase before the verb so that the modified noun appears closer to the beginning of the sentence. Here's the corrected version: Corrected Sentence: ""Angela, who achieved the best result, was...""",1,
The building's the roof is leaking.,0,"Syntax Explanation: In this sentence, there is a subject-verb agreement error. The singular subject ""the building"" does not agree with the plural verb ""are."" It should be ""The building's roof is leaking,"" or better yet, ""The roof of the building is leaking"" for clarity and proper syntax.",1,
Did Calvin his homework?,0,"Syntax The sentence ""Did Calvin his homework?"" is syntactically incorrect because it lacks a proper auxiliary verb for forming questions in English. A correct version would be ""Did Calvin do his homework?"" or simply ""Calvin did his homework.""",1,
John thinks that Mary loves himself.,0,"Syntax The reflexive pronoun ""himself"" does not agree with the subject ""John."" The correct form would be ""himself"" if the subject was plural or a gender-neutral singular noun, but since it's just ""John,"" the correct reflexive pronoun here is ""himself."" So, the corrected sentence should read: ""John thinks that Mary loves him.""",1,
Any man didn't eat dinner.,0,"Syntax The sentence ""Any man didn't eat dinner"" contains a double negative, which is incorrect in standard English. The corrected version would be ""No man ate dinner"" or ""Any man did not eat dinner.""",1,
John whispered Mary left.,0,"Syntax Explanation: The sentence ""John whispered Mary left"" is syntactically incorrect because it does not clearly express the relationship between the actions of John whispering and Mary leaving. To make the sentence grammatically correct, a coordinating conjunction (e.g., 'and') or a subordinating conjunction (e.g., 'when', 'while') can be added: * Correct Sentence #1: John whispered, and Mary left. * Correct Sentence #2: When John whispered, Mary left.",1,
Everyone hopes everyone to sleep.,0,"Syntax The sentence ""Everyone hopes everyone to sleep"" is grammatically incorrect because it lacks a verb after ""everyone."" A corrected version could be ""Everyone hopes that everyone else will sleep.""",1,
I saw Bill while you did so Mary.,0,"Syntax Explanation: The coordinating conjunction ""while"" should be replaced with a comma or another appropriate conjunction, as it does not correctly connect the two independent clauses (""I saw Bill"" and ""you did so Mary""). A corrected version could read: ""I saw Bill, while you did so with Mary."" However, even with this correction, the sentence remains somewhat awkward due to the use of ""did so,"" making the overall meaning unclear. It may need further revision for clarity and coherence.",1,
What Mary did Bill was give a book.,0,"Syntax Explanation: The sentence contains a syntax error known as a misplaced modifier. In this case, the phrase ""what Mary did"" incorrectly modifies ""Bill,"" implying that Bill himself was what Mary did rather than specifying the action performed by Bill. A corrected version would be: ""What Mary did was give Bill a book.""",1,
Anson demonized,0,"Syntax The issue with the sentence ""Anson demonized"" is related to syntax, specifically, it lacks a direct object or an infinitive verb to complete its meaning. To make the statement grammatically correct, we could add a suitable direct object such as ""Anson demonized corruption.""",1,
Medea tried the nurse to poison her children.,0,"Syntax The sentence ""Medea tried the nurse to poison her children"" contains a syntax error because it uses an incorrect preposition after the verb ""tried."" The corrected sentence would be: ""Medea tried to poison her children through the nurse.""",1,
I ate that she was happy,0,"Syntax The sentence ""I ate that she was happy"" is grammatically incorrect due to a syntax error. The word ""that"" is being used as a conjunction here, but it's actually functioning as a relative pronoun, creating confusion. A more appropriate way to phrase this idea would be ""I knew that she was happy.""",1,"Syntax, Semantics"
I thought he liked myself,0,"Syntax The sentence ""I thought he liked myself"" contains a mistake in subject-verb agreement. The verb ""liked"" does not agree with its subject ""I"". It should be ""me"", not ""myself"". A better way to phrase it would be ""I thought he liked me.""",1,
What did you ask who saw?,0,"Semantics The sentence ""What did you ask who saw?"" is semantically incorrect because it lacks a clear subject and object. It's unclear what or who the speaker is asking about, making it difficult for the listener to understand the intended meaning. To make the sentence grammatically correct, we could rephrase it as ""Who did you ask what they saw?"" This way, both the subject (who) and the object (what) are clearly defined.",0,Syntax
The bookcase ran,0,"Syntax The sentence ""The bookcase ran"" is grammatically incorrect because inanimate objects such as a bookcase cannot run. This error falls under syntax, or the arrangement of words to create meaningful sentences.",0,Semantics
