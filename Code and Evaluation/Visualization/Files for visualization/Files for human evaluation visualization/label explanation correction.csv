"As you eat the most, you want the least.",0,"The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in this sentence. The subject of the sentence is ""you,"" which is singular, but the verb ""eat"" is paired with a plural pronoun ""the most.""

The tube was escaped by gas.,0,"In this sentence, the verb ""escaped"" does not agree with its subject ""the tube"".

What the water did to the whole bottle was fill it.,0,"The subject (""the water"") and verb (""did"") in this sentence do not agree in number. Since ""water"" is singular, the third person singular form of the verb must be used, which is ""does,"" not ""did."" Additionally, a more natural phrasing would use a passive voice construction such as ""The bottle was filled by the water.""","The water filled the whole bottle.

Mary came to be introduced by the bartender and I also came to be.,0,"The second half of the sentence ""I also came to be"" is grammatically incorrect. It's not idiomatic to say ""come to be"" in this context. Instead, it should simply be ""and so did I"".

"I know which book José didn't read for class, and which book Lilly did it for him.",0,"The pronoun used in the second part of the sentence (""it"") does not clearly refer to anything.

I know a man who Tom drives as drives.,0,"The sentence contains multiple errors. Specifically, there is a repeated word (""drives"") and an incorrect use of the pronoun ""who"" instead of ""that"".

The proof this set is recursive is difficult.,0,"There is a mistake in capitalization. In English, we always capitalize the first letter of a sentence. Therefore, ""the"" needs to be capitalized.

Wind was gotten of a plot to negotiate an honorable end to the war in Vietnam.,0,"The past participle form of the verb 'get' is 'gotten' when used in a transitive sense (meaning it takes an object), as in ""I have got**ten** a new car"". However, here, the error lies in using 'gotten' instead of the simple past tense 'got'. In addition, there seems to be some confusion regarding the passive voice; consider revising the sentence for clarity. I suppose you want to say something like ""A plan to negotiate an honorable end to the war in Vietnam had been winded up"" if talking about finishing a previous attempt. Otherwise, ""Wind was involved in a plot to negotiate an honorable end to the war in Vietnam"" might work.

"Every student, and he wears socks, is a swinger.",0,"The sentence contains multiple errors in subject-verb agreement as well as pronoun reference. In the first part of the sentence, 'Every student' is singular, so it requires a singular verb form such as 'is'. However, 'and he wears socks' suggests that there might be more than one person being referred to, which would require a plural verb form such as 'are'. Moreover, the use of 'he' without specifying who it refers to can lead to confusion about whom the statement applies to.

I can't remember the name of somebody who had misgivings.,0,"The subject of the sentence is ""I,"" which is a singular first-person pronoun. However, the verb form used after the subject (""can't remember"") is negative contraction of cannot, which is typically used for plural subjects or formal second person singular subjects. In this case, since the subject is singular, we need to use the singular form of the auxiliary verb ""do"" before ""remember"". Therefore, the correct form would be ""I don't remember.""

The farmer dumped the cart with apples.,0,"In this context, ""dump"" suggests that the contents of the cart were discarded carelessly, which is unlikely to be true for a cart full of valuable produce such as apples.

Brian threw the fence with the stick.,0,"The sentence is incorrect because people throw objects such as balls or frisbees, not fences.

Paperback books lift onto the table easily.,0,"The verb ""lift"" requires an object to complete its meaning, but there is no direct object in this sentence. Additionally, the preposition ""onto"" suggests a directional movement towards something, so it needs to be followed by a noun or pronoun indicating what is being lifted onto the table. A more grammatically correct version of this sentence would be ""Paperback books lift easily onto the table,"" although this still implies that the books themselves have agency, which may not be the intended meaning.

The jeweller scribbled the contract with his name.,0,"The subject of the sentence is ""the jeweler,"" which is a singular noun.

Additionally, there seems to be some confusion about what exactly the jeweler is supposed to have scribbled on the contract - his own name?

I squeaked the door.,0,"The verb ""squeak"" is typically an intransitive verb, meaning it does not take a direct object. In this case, the sentence attempts to use ""the door"" as a direct object of ""squeak,"" which is incorrect.

The monkeys proud of their leader.,0,"This sentence is missing a verb.

I drank some of water.,0,"The verb ""drank"" does not agree with its subject ""I"". In present tense, we would say ""I drink"", but in past tense it should be ""I drank"".

He washed yourself.,0,"The verb ""washed"" requires an object pronoun such as ""him,"" ""her,"" or ""it,"" but instead, a reflexive pronoun ""yourself"" is used.

John will rain tomorrow.,0,"The verb ""rain"" is an impersonal verb that doesn't have a subject.

Did the child be in the school?,0,"The sentence contains a verb form error. In English, we use the auxiliary verb ""did"" to ask questions about past simple tense. So, the correct form of the verb ""to be"" after ""did"" should be ""be"".
