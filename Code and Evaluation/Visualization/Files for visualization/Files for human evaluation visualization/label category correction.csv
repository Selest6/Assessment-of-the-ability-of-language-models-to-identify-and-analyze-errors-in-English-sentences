Sue gave to Bill a book.,0,Syntax,"The sentence should be ""Sue gave Bill a book"" instead of ""Sue gave to Bill a book"". In English, we usually say ""give something to someone"", so the preposition ""to"" should come after the indirect object ""Bill"".",1,,1,1,2,1
Us love they.,0,Syntax,"They love us. Explanation: The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in the original sentence. In English, a verb must agree in number with its subject; since ""they"" is plural, the verb must be as well. Therefore, ""us love they"" should be changed to ""They love us"".",1,,1,1,2,1
"I know which book José didn't read for class, and which book Lilly did it for him.",0,Semantics,"The sentence is not strictly grammatically incorrect but is potentially ambiguous or unclear. A clearer version could be: ""I know which book José didn’t read for class, and which book Lilly read instead for him.""",0,Syntax,1,1,2,1
"This is the book which Bob reviewed, and this is the one which Fred won't do it.",0,Syntax,"The book which Bob reviewed, and this is the one which Fred won't do. Explanation: In your original sentence, there is a misplaced pronoun ""it"" at the end of the second clause. It seems unclear what ""it"" refers to because the first clause talks about two different books - ""this book"" and ""the one"". To make the meaning clearer, I removed the unnecessary pronoun ""it"", so now the corrected sentence only has one referent for ""one"": ""This is the book which Bob reviewed, and this is the one which Fred won't do.""",1,,1,0,1,1
A proof that the claim had been. made was giver that John had lied.,0,Syntax,A proof that the claim had been made was provided because John had lied.,1,,1,1,2,1
Which boy's did we elect guardian's employer president?,0,Syntax,"Whose boy's did we elect the guardians' employer's president? Explanation: The possessive form for plural nouns requires an apostrophe after the 's'. Therefore, it should be ""guardians'"", ""employer's"" instead of ""guardian's"", ""employers"". Additionally, a clear antecedent for ""whose"" needs to be established; I assumed it refers to boys but without context, it could refer to any group.",1,,1,0,1,1
Wind was gotten of a plot to negotiate an honorable end to the war in Vietnam.,0,Syntax,"The wind was blown off a plot to negotiate an honorable end to the war in Vietnam. Explanation: In the original sentence, ""was gotten"" is incorrect because ""get"" in its past participle form is ""gotten,"" but it cannot be used as the passive voice of ""blow away"" as in your example. Therefore, I changed it to ""was blown off"". Also, there's no need for an article before ""plot"", so I removed it.",1,,1,0,1,1
Which girl did Mike quip never wore this hat?,0,Syntax,"Which girl did Mike quip never wore THAT hat? In the original sentence, there is a pronoun ""this"" referring to the hat, but no antecedent for it is provided earlier in the sentence. To make the sentence grammatically correct, I replaced ""this"" with ""that"", implying that the referent of ""that"" has been previously mentioned.",1,,1,0,1,1
I won't have some money.,0,Morphology,I will not have some money. OR I won't have any money.,0,Syntax,1,"0,5","1,5",1
Here's a knife with which for you to cut up the onions.,0,Syntax,"Here's a knife for you to cut up the onions with. Explanation: The preposition ""with"" should come after the verb it modifies (""cut"") instead of before it, so the corrected sentence would be ""Here's a knife for you to cut up the onions with.""",1,,1,1,2,1
The socks are ready for for you to put on to be planned.,0,Syntax,"The socks are ready for you to put on, not ""to be planned."" It's unclear what it would mean for socks to be ""planned,"" so we need to remove that part of the sentence. Additionally, there is a repeated preposition ""for"" which should only appear once.",1,"Syntax, Semantics",1,1,2,1
"No writer, nor any playwright, meets in Vienna.",0,Syntax,"At least one correction needs to be made for the sentence to be grammatically correct. I would suggest changing ""No"" to ""None of"" so that it reads as follows: ""None of the writers or playwrights meet in Vienna."" This changes the meaning slightly but makes the syntax grammatical. Alternatively, if the intended meaning is that no such person exists who both writes and is a playwright and they all meet in Vienna, then rearrange the wording thusly: ""There is no writer-playwright who meets in Vienna.""",1,,1,1,2,1
Sam offered the ball out of the basket.,0,Syntax,"The sentence is already correct. The syntax is correct in this sentence. All the words have been used correctly and form a grammatically correct structure. However, depending on context there might be some issues related to semantics as it's unclear whether Sam took the ball out from inside the basket or he gave the ball away while standing near the basket.",1,,0,0,0,0
The farmer dumped the cart with apples.,0,Syntax,"The sentence is already correct. In English, it's common for a direct object to come before the prepositional phrase when both refer to the same noun or pronoun. So, ""the farmer dumped the cart with apples"" is grammatically correct as written.",1,,0,0,0,0
The jeweller scribbled the contract with his name.,0,Syntax,"The sentence is not correct. A more appropriate way to phrase it would be: ""The jeweler signed the contract with his name."" The verb ""scribble"" implies hurried and careless writing, which may not be suitable for signing a legal document such as a contract.",1,,1,1,2,1
Cynthia chewed.,0,Other Category,"The sentence is already correct. Explanation: The sentence 'Cynthia chewed' is grammatically correct but it lacks context. It would be more informative if a specific object of the verb 'chewed' was provided for better understanding. However, based on the instructions provided, I will only check for grammatical errors.",0,"Syntax, Semantics",0,0,0,0
My heart is pounding me.,0,Syntax,"The sentence should be ""My heart is pounding"" instead of ""My heart is pounding me"". In English, we don't say that our heart pounds us; rather, it pounds on its own inside our chest.",1,"Syntax, Semantics",1,1,2,1
The fort fluttered with many flags.,0,Syntax,"The flag on the fort fluttered with many others. Explanation: In your original sentence, it's unclear what exactly is ""fluttering with many flags"". I assumed you meant a single flag was flapping in the wind along with other flags. So, I changed ""fort"" to ""flag on the fort"", indicating there is only one flag associated with the fort.",0,Semantics,1,1,2,1
many information was provided.,0,Syntax,"Much information was provided. Explanation: The word 'many' is used for countable nouns while 'much' is used for uncountable nouns such as 'information'. Therefore, 'much information' would be grammatically correct instead of 'many information'.",1,,1,1,2,1
Wash you!,0,Syntax,"The correct form should be ""Wash YOU!"" with appropriate punctuation. In English, we need to add a question mark at the end of questions, as in ""Wash you?"" However, it would still sound more natural to say ""Will you wash yourself?"" instead.",1,,1,"0,5","1,5",1
It was the policeman met that several young students in the park last night.,0,Syntax,"The sentence should be structured as ""It was [subject] who/that [verb]..."" instead of ""[verb]...that [subject]"", so a corrected version would be: ""It was several young students who/that the policeman met in the park last night.""",1,,1,0,1,1
A good friend is remained to me by him.,0,Syntax,"The sentence should be ""A good friend remains to me by him,"" but it would still sound more natural as ""He has remained a good friend to me.""",1,,1,"0,5","1,5",1
Students studying English reads Conrad's Heart of Darkness while at university.,0,Syntax,"The corrected sentence should be either ""Students who are studying English read Conrad's Heart of Darkness while at university"" or ""Students study Conrad's Heart of Darkness while at university"". The original sentence incorrectly uses both a singular verb (""studying"") and a plural subject (""Students"").",1,,1,1,2,1
Neither of students failed.,0,Syntax,"Either of the students failed. Explanation: The word 'neither' refers to both parts being false, so it needs 'of' + plural noun after it. However, if we want to say only one part can be true then we need to use 'either'. Therefore, the corrected version would be 'Either of the students failed.'",1,,1,1,2,1
There seemed to be intelligent.,0,Syntax,"The corrected sentence should be: ""There seemed to be someone who was intelligent."" or ""It seemed that there was intelligence present."", as the original sentence lacks a clear subject and predicate.",1,,1,1,2,1
We believed John to be a fountain in the park.,0,Semantics,"The sentence is not correct. A more appropriate correction would be: ""We believed John to be the source in the park,"" since it's semantically incorrect to consider a person as a physical object such as a 'fountain'.",1,,1,1,2,1
I hope to would study in France.,0,Syntax,I hope to study in France. Explanation: The word 'would' after 'hope' is unnecessary and incorrect because it introduces a second conditional clause where only one is needed. The verb tense must be consistent within a single independent clause.,1,,1,1,2,1
John will rain tomorrow.,0,Syntax,"The sentence is not correct. The correct version would be ""It will rain tomorrow."", as subject-verb-object order does not apply here and we need a dummy subject (""it"") for weather verbs.",0,Semantics,1,1,2,1
Did the child be in the school?,0,Syntax,"The corrected version of the sentence would be: ""Did the child stay in the school?"" or ""Was the child in the school?"" The original sentence is incorrect because it uses the wrong tense of the verb ""to be"" for this context.",1,,1,1,2,1
A pound was weighed by the book.,0,Syntax,"The book weighed a pound. Explanation: In the original sentence, it says that “a pound was weighed,” but what was actually weighed is missing from the sentence. Also, the passive voice makes the sentence less clear than its active counterpart. Here, I have changed the word order so that it’s clearer who did the weighing, making for a more natural-sounding and accurate sentence.",1,"Syntax, Semantics",1,1,2,1
Fed knows which politician her to vote for.,0,Syntax,"The corrected sentence should be: ""Fed knows which politician he should vote for"" or ""Fed knows whom she should vote for"". In the original sentence, there is a mismatch between the gender of the subject (""Fed"") and the pronoun used later on (""her""). This error can result in confusion about who is being referred to as the intended voter.",1,,1,1,2,1
Jack is the person with whom Jenny fell in love with.,0,Syntax,"The sentence should be ""Jack is the person with whom Jenny fell in love."" No extra ""with"" is needed after ""fell in love"".",1,,1,1,2,1
Which topic did you get bored because Mary talked about?,0,Syntax,"I got bored with the topic that Mary kept talking about. Explanation: The original sentence contains a grammatical error known as a dangling modifier. In the corrected version, the pronoun ""I"" has been added as the subject of the sentence, making it clear who became bored. Additionally, the preposition ""with"" clarifies what specifically caused the speaker's boredom.",1,,1,1,2,1
Who achieved the best result was Angela.,0,Syntax,"The person who achieved the best result was Angela. Explanation: In order for the sentence to be grammatically correct, it needs a subject before the verb ""was"". Therefore, I added the word ""person"" to make the sentence clearer and avoid confusion about what ""who"" refers to.",1,,1,1,2,1
Blue leather shows herself that Betsy is pretty.,0,Syntax,"The sentence should be ""Blue leather shows that Betsy is pretty"" or ""Betsy's blue leather shoes show that she is pretty."" In its current form, the subject (""blue leather"") does not grammatically agree with the verb (""shows""), and it is unclear who or what is doing the showing. Additionally, using a reflexive pronoun such as ""herself"" implies that ""leather"" possesses self-awareness, which is unlikely.",1,,1,1,2,1
the panther's the coat is dark black.,0,Syntax,"The panther's coat is dark black. (removed the extra ""the"")",1,,1,1,2,1
Did Calvin his homework?,0,Syntax,"The correct form of the sentence would be ""Did Calvin do his homework?"" instead of ""Did Calvin his homework?"" In English, we need to use a helping verb such as 'do' after question words like 'did'. Also, possessive pronouns like 'his', 'her', etc., follow the noun they modify when used after a linking verb but come before the main verb when it acts as the subject complement.",1,,1,1,2,1
She goes and buying some whiskey.,0,Syntax,"The corrected sentence should be: ""She goes and **buys** some whiskey."" In this case, the verb ""goes"" needs a present participle form after it, instead of a gerund form as used in the original sentence.",1,,1,1,2,1
Kim and Terry is happy.,0,Syntax,"The correct version of the sentence would be ""Kim and Terry are happy."" The subject of the sentence consists of two people (""Kim"" and ""Terry""), so we need a plural verb form (""are"") instead of a singular one (""is"").",1,,1,1,2,1
"Put a picture of Bill on your desk before tomorrow, this girl in the red coat will put a picture of Bill on your desk before tomorrow.",0,Syntax,"Put a picture of Bill on your desk by tomorrow; this girl in the red coat will also put a picture of Bill on your desk by tomorrow. Explanation: The original sentence contains two separate commands but uses only one instance of ""before tomorrow,"" making it unclear whether both actions need to be completed before tomorrow or just one. By using ""by tomorrow"" instead, I've clarified that both actions should be completed by the same time. Additionally, I changed ""this girl in the red coat will put"" to ""this girl in the red coat will also put"" to emphasize that she is doing the same action as the speaker.",1,,1,1,2,1
Mary revealed himself to John.,0,Syntax,Mary revealed herself to John. The pronoun should match the gender of the person it refers to.,1,,1,1,2,1
You should sit before there.,0,Syntax,"The sentence should be ""You should sit before it."" or ""You should sit there before him/her/them."", since ""before"" can function as a preposition taking an object or an adverb modifying a verb. In your original sentence, without adding necessary pronouns, ""there"" cannot correctly serve as an object for ""before"".",1,,1,1,2,1
Anson demonized up the Khyber,0,Syntax,"The sentence is not correct. A more grammatically correct version could be ""Anson defamed the Khyber"" or ""Anson demonized the Khyber"".",1,,1,1,2,1
What did you ask who Medea gave?,0,Syntax,"Who did Medea give something to? Explanation: The original sentence contains a word order error known as a ""dangling modifier"" where it's unclear what ""who"" refers to. A corrected version would be ""Who did Medea give something to?""",1,,1,1,2,1
Medea tried the nurse to poison her children.,0,Syntax,"The sentence should be ""Medea tried to poison her children through the nurse"" or ""Medea attempted to have the nurse poison her children"".",1,,1,1,2,1
Anson thought that himself was happy.,0,Syntax,"The sentence should be ""Anson thought he was happy"" instead of ""Anson thought that himself was happy"". In the original sentence, ""himself"" is used incorrectly as a subject pronoun; it should be the object pronoun ""he"", since it follows the verb ""thought"".",1,,1,1,2,1
What did you ask who saw?,0,Syntax,"Who did you ask what they saw? Explanation: In your original sentence, ""What"" is incorrect because it's asking about the subject rather than the object. The corrected version uses ""what"" as a relative pronoun referring to the direct object (""they saw"").",1,,1,1,2,1
Which king did you ask which city invaded?,0,Syntax,"You didn't specify which king or which city you asked about. Could you please rephrase your question so it includes both a specific king and a specific city? For example, ""Which city did King Charles invade?"" or ""Which king invaded Paris?"" Thank you!",1,,0,0,0,0
I inquired when could we leave.,0,Syntax,"I inquired when we could leave. Explanation: The subject (""I"") and verb (""inquired"") agree in number, so there's no issue with morphology. The sentence makes sense semantically, as it conveys a question about leaving. However, the error lies in syntax - specifically word order. In indirect questions, such as this one, the subject-auxiliary inversion does not occur; therefore, ""could"" must follow ""we"".",1,,1,1,2,1
The bookcase ran,0,Syntax,The sentence is not correct. A bookcase cannot run. It can only hold books.,0,Semantics,0,0,0,0
