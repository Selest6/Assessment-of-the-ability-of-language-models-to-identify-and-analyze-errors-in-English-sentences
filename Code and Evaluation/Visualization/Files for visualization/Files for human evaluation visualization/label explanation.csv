"The more you would want, the less you would eat.",0,"This sentence is grammatically incorrect because of its structure and meaning. A better way to phrase it could be ""The less you want, the more you will eat."" In the original sentence, there's a mismatch between wanting more (which usually leads to eating more) and wanting less (which typically results in eating less).",1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,2,4,2,2,0
"The more does Bill smoke, the more Susan hates him.",0,"This sentence contains a common error known as a ""mixed construction."" Specifically, it mixes two different types of comparative constructions without using parallel structure. The first part of the sentence uses the comparative form ""more"" with the verb ""does smoke,"" while the second part uses the comparative form ""more"" with the noun phrase ""the more."" To fix this issue, we can rephrase one or both parts of the sentence to use consistent grammatical structures. For example, we could say ""The more Bill smokes, the more Susan dislikes him"" (both parts now use the comparative form ""the more"" followed by a verb) or ""Bill smokes a lot, which makes Susan hate him even more"" (now both parts use separate independent clauses).",1,1,1,"0,5",1,1,1,1,2,"7,5","5,5",3,"2,5"
Who does John visit Sally because he likes?,0,"The sentence contains a grammatical error known as a dangling modifier. The phrase ""because he likes"" cannot correctly modify the subject of the main clause (""John"") since it's unclear who or what John likes.

The tube was escaped by gas.,0,"In this sentence, ""escaped"" is used incorrectly because it implies that the subject (the gas) actively did something to help someone or something get away. However, based on context, we can infer that the intended meaning of the sentence is likely that the gas caused people to escape from the tube. A more appropriate way to phrase this would be ""The tube was evacuated due to gas.""",1,1,1,0,"0,5",0,1,1,2,"5,5","3,5","2,5",1
They represented seriously to the dean Mary as a genuine linguist.,0,"The sentence contains a couple of errors. First, there should be a comma after ""seriously"" to separate it from the main clause. Second, ""as"" should be replaced with ""who,"" since we're referring to someone rather than comparing them (Mary isn't being considered equal to a genuine linguist). A corrected version would read: ""They represented themselves seriously to the dean, Mary, who was a genuine linguist.""",1,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,2,5,3,3,0
The madrigals which Henry plays the lute and sings sound lousy.,0,"There is a missing conjunction between the two clauses ""Henry plays the lute"" and ""sings."" It would be more grammatically correct to say ""Henry plays the lute and sings,"" or ""Henry plays the lute but sings,"" depending on the intended meaning. Additionally, there is no article before ""madrigals,"" it should either be ""the madrigals"" if referring to specific ones or simply ""madrigals"" without an article if talking about the general concept of madrigals.",1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,0
Which boy's did we elect guardian's employer president?,0,"The sentence contains multiple grammatical errors. Firstly, there is a missing determiner before ""boy's,"" making it unclear to whom the possessive form refers. Secondly, the verb tense used in ""did"" does not agree with the rest of the sentence since it uses present-tense verbs (""are""). Lastly, the phrase ""guardian's employer president"" is confusing and lacks proper context or subject agreement. Therefore, this sentence requires significant rephrasing for clarity and accuracy.",1,"0,5",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"2,5","2,5",2,"0,5"
Sam gave the ball out of the basket.,0,"The phrase ""gave the ball out"" is incorrect because it suggests that the ball was somehow located outside of Sam. A more appropriate way to phrase this would be ""Sam took the ball out of the basket."" This implies that the ball was originally inside the basket, which seems to be what was intended by the original sentence.",1,1,"0,5",0,"0,5",1,1,1,2,6,4,2,2
No one can forgive that comment to you.,0,"The sentence contains a pronoun error. It should be ""you all"" instead of just ""you.""

Janet broke Bill on the finger.,0,"The verb ""broke"" does not make sense in this context when used with the preposition ""on"". A more appropriate word might be ""hurt"", but even so, a better way to phrase it would be ""Janet hurt Bill's finger.""",1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,2,6,4,2,2
Brian threw the fence with the stick.,0,"The sentence ""Brian threw the fence with the stick"" is grammatically incorrect because we cannot throw a fence with a stick. A more appropriate way to phrase it would be ""Brian used the stick to throw over the fence.""",1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,3,2,1,1
The books lifted onto the table.,0,"In present tense, we use 'lift' as the verb when the subject refers to a singular noun (e.g., ""The boy lifts the book""). However, for plural subjects (in this case, 'books'), the correct form of the verb is 'lift'. Therefore, the correct sentence would be: ""The books lift onto the table."" But since it is more common to say ""The books were lifted onto the table"" or ""Someone lifted the books onto the table,"" I will still mark this as incorrect because the original sentence structure doesn't make sense even if we change the verb form to match a plural subject.",1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,2,6,4,3,1
Lora buttered at the toast.,0,"The verb ""butter"" requires a direct object to complete its meaning, so the sentence ""Lora buttered at the toast"" is incorrect. It should be ""Lora buttered the toast."" In English, transitive verbs (verbs that require a direct object) cannot be followed by the preposition ""at,"" which is used to indicate location or direction.",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,8,6,3,3
Packages drive easily to New York.,0,"The sentence contains a subject-verb agreement error. The subject of the sentence is ""packages,"" which is plural. Therefore, the verb should also be plural. In this case, the verb ""drive"" should be changed to ""drive"" (present tense) or ""drive"" (past tense), depending on the intended meaning. A corrected version could be ""Packages drive easily to New York"" (if referring to something that packages can do themselves) or ""Package drivers easily go to New York"" (if referring to people who transport packages).",1,1,"0,5",0,1,0,1,"0,5","1,5",5,"3,5","2,5",1
A job offered.,0,"The sentence ""A job offered"" is grammatically incomplete as it lacks a subject or an object to form a complete thought. It could be revised to something like ""They offered a job,"" or ""A job was offered.""",1,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,2,5,3,3,0
They have no in.,0,"The sentence ""They have no in"" is grammatically incorrect because it is missing a complete thought or object. It seems that there might be a missing word such as ""problem,"" ""idea,"" etc., which would make the sentence complete and understandable. For example, if we say ""They have no ideas,"" then the sentence becomes grammatically correct.",1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,2,5,3,2,1
Some my jobs are in jeopardy.,0,"The subject of the sentence is incorrect. It should be ""Some **of** my jobs,"" not just ""some my jobs."" This is because we need a preposition (""of"") to connect the plural noun ""jobs"" with its determiner ""my"".

A good friend is remained to me by him.,0,"The verb ""remains"" should be used instead of ""is remained.""

Kim depends for Sandy.,0,"The sentence contains a grammatical error. It should be ""Kim depends on Sandy"" instead of ""Kim depends for Sandy"". In English, we use 'depend on' to express reliance or dependence on someone or something, followed by the preposition 'on'.",0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,2,4,2,1,1
John paid me against the book.,0,"The preposition ""against"" is incorrect in this context. It seems that the speaker wants to say that John paid them for a book. A more appropriate way to phrase it would be ""John paid me for the book.""",1,1,"0,5",0,0,0,1,1,2,"4,5","2,5","1,5",1
Students studying English reads Conrad's Heart of Darkness while at university.,0,"The verb in the sentence should agree with its subject in number. In this case, the subject is ""students,"" which is plural. Therefore, the correct form of the verb to use would be ""read"" instead of ""reads.""

He washed yourself.,0,"The verb 'wash' requires an object to complete its meaning, but 'yourself' is a reflexive pronoun that already includes the idea of an object (the person performing the action on themselves). Therefore, using both together creates redundancy and grammatically incorrect sentence. A better way to phrase it would be 'He washed himself.' or 'He washed you./him./her./us./them.', depending on who was being washed.",1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,2,6,4,2,2
There is believed to be sheep in the park.,0,"The verb ""is"" or ""are"" should be used instead of ""to be"" after ""there is believed.""

I hope to would study in France.,0,"The sentence contains a mistake in verb tense agreement. In this context, we need to use ""will"" instead of ""would."" Also, there's no comma needed after 'Firstly.' A corrected version might be: ""Firstly, I will study in France.""",1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,2,6,4,2,2
Did the child be in the school?,0,"The verb ""be"" should be used as an auxiliary verb in the past tense (""did be"") or present tense (""is/am/are""), but it cannot stand alone as the main verb in a sentence. Additionally, subject-auxiliary inversion (e.g., ""Did the child..."") requires a question format, so we need to add a question mark at the end of the sentence.

A pound was weighed by the book.,0,"The verb tense used in this sentence does not make logical sense. The past tense of the verb ""weigh"" (was weighed) indicates that the action occurred in the past, but there is no clear subject performing the action. Additionally, it's unclear what it means for a ""pound"" to be weighed, since a pound is a unit of weight itself. It would be more appropriate to say something like ""The book was weighed on the scale.""",1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,2,6,4,2,2
Fed knows which politician her to vote for.,0,"The pronouns used in this sentence do not agree. It's unclear who ""her"" refers to because there's no clear female antecedent mentioned earlier in the sentence. Additionally, if we assume that ""Fed"" is a person (which is itself unusual since it's typically short for Federal), the verb form should be ""knows,"" not ""know.""

Jack is the person with whom Jenny fell in love with.,0,"The sentence contains a redundant preposition. The phrase ""with whom"" already indicates that Jenny fell in love with someone, so there's no need to include the additional ""with.""

Which topic did you get bored because Mary talked about?,0,"The sentence contains a pronoun ambiguity error. It's unclear whether ""you"" refers to the speaker or the listener.

1 gave Mary after the party a book.,0,"The sentence contains two issues. Firstly, there should be a comma after ""party"" to separate the introductory phrase from the main clause (i.e., ""I gave Mary after the party a book.""). Secondly, we typically use ""to"" instead of ""a"" before the direct object when it's a person (i.e., ""Mary"" here) receiving something (i.e., ""book"").

Blue leather shows herself that Betsy is pretty.,0,"The subject of the second clause (""Betsy is pretty"") is ""Betsy,"" which requires a singular verb form to agree in number.

Any man didn't eat dinner.,0,"This sentence contains a double negative (""didn't"" and ""any""), which can result in a positive meaning when it should be negative.

She goes and buying some whiskey.,0,"The sentence contains a grammatical error. It should be ""She goes to buy some whiskey"" instead of ""She goes and buying some whiskey.""

John's mother likes himself.,0,"The pronoun used to refer back to the subject of a sentence should match its grammatical number and gender.

I saw Bill while you did so Mary.,0,"The sentence contains a coordinating conjunction (""while"") that connects two independent clauses, but there is no comma before the conjunction. This makes the sentence difficult to read and understand because it's unclear whether ""you did so"" refers to what the speaker or someone else did. To fix this error, add a comma after ""Bill"": ""I saw Bill, while you did so, Mary.""

Anson demonized,0,"The sentence ""Anson demonized"" is grammatically incomplete as it lacks a direct object or indirect object to complete its meaning. For example, one could say ""Anson demonized the proposal,"" which would be grammatical and meaningful. Without additional context or information, however, I cannot assume what Anson might have demonized, so for now, I will assume that the original sentence was intended to stand alone without any further clarification. In such cases, we need a direct object or an indirect object to make sense of the verb used in a sentence.

Gilgamesh is having fought the dragon.,0,"The verb tense in this sentence is incorrect.
