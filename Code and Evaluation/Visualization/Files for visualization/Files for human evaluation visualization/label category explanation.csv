Who does John visit Sally because he likes?,0,Syntax,"The sentence contains a misplaced relative clause ""because he likes.""

Us love they.,0,Syntax,"In standard English, subject pronouns (I, you, he, she, it, we, they) typically come before verbs.

"This is the book which Bob reviewed, and this is the one which Fred won't do it.",0,Semantics,"The second sentence is grammatically incorrect because the pronoun 'it' does not have a clear antecedent. It is unclear what exactly ""Fred won't do."" In order for the sentence to be corrected, it needs to specify what action or item Fred refuses to do or take.

Which report that John was incompetent did he submit?,0,Syntax,"The sentence contains a misplaced relative pronoun ""that.""

I know a man who Tom drives as drives.,0,Syntax,"The sentence contains multiple syntax errors. Specifically, there are two instances of the verb ""drives"" used incorrectly.

Himself is understood by Rutherford.,0,Syntax,"The sentence ""Himself is understood by Rutherford"" contains a syntactic error because it violates the rule for reflexive pronouns. In English grammar, a reflexive pronoun (e.g., myself, yourself, himself) must refer back to a noun or pronoun within the same clause.

The proof this set is recursive is difficult.,0,Syntax,"In this case, there is a subject-verb agreement error. The singular subject ""the proof"" requires a singular verb, but ""is"" is plural. It should be ""The proof is difficult,"" or ""Proving this set is difficult."" Additionally, the phrase ""this set"" lacks an article (a/an), so it should be ""the set"".

The madrigals which Henry plays the lute and sings sound lousy.,0,Syntax,"This sentence contains a syntactic error known as a ""comma splice."" Comma splices occur when two independent clauses (clauses that can stand alone as complete sentences) are joined by only a comma. In this case, ""The madrigals which Henry plays the lute"" and ""sound lousy"" are both independent clauses, but they are incorrectly connected by a comma. To fix this error, we could either use a semicolon or period instead of the comma, or add a conjunction such as ""and"" after the comma. For example: ""The madrigals which Henry plays the lute and sings sound lousy."" or ""The madrigals which Henry plays the lute sound lousy; he sings along anyway.""",1,,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,4,3,3,0
I won't have some money.,0,Syntax,"The sentence ""I won't have some money"" contains a syntactic error because it uses the wrong form of the verb after ""won't."" In negative statements using contractions (e.g., ""won't""), we use the base form of the verb instead of adding ""-n't"" or ""-not"" to the verb.

The socks are ready for for you to put on to be planned.,0,Syntax,"The sentence contains a redundancy error in the phrase ""for for."" In English, we only need to use the preposition ""for"" once when expressing purpose or possession. Therefore, the corrected version would be: ""The socks are ready for you to put on to be planned.""

"No writer, nor any playwright, meets in Vienna.",0,Semantics,"The sentence contains a semantic error because it lacks context or information necessary for understanding who or what is being referred to by ""No writer, nor any playwright."" It seems as though there may be some missing information about why we would care if no writers meet in Vienna.

Janet broke Bill on the finger.,0,Syntax,"The verb ""break"" requires a direct object that describes what was broken. In this case, ""Bill"" cannot be the direct object because people generally can't be described as being ""broken."" Additionally, it seems unlikely that the intended meaning is for Janet to have physically injured Bill's finger. A more appropriate way to phrase the sentence could be ""Janet broke Bill's finger,"" or if the intent is to say that Bill did something wrong, then ""Janet caught Bill in the act (of doing something) on finger.""",1,,1,1,1,1,"0,5",1,1,"0,5","1,5",7,"5,5","2,5",3
Carla slid at the book.,0,Syntax,"The sentence ""Carla slid at the book"" is syntactically incorrect because the preposition ""at"" is used incorrectly in this context.

Packages drive easily to New York.,0,Syntax,"The subject-verb agreement in this sentence is incorrect. The plural noun ""packages"" does not agree with the singular verb ""drive."" It should be either ""Packages drives easily to New York"" (if there's only one package driving) or ""Packages drive easily to New York"" (with a different meaning).

My heart is pounding me.,0,Syntax,"In standard English, we would say ""My heart is pounding"" rather than ""My heart is pounding me."" The verb ""pound"" can take a direct object (as in ""She pounded the dough""), but when used metaphorically as here to describe a feeling or sensation, it does not need one. Additionally, if we wanted to express the idea of something causing a physical reaction in oneself using a reflexive pronoun such as ""me,"" we might instead use a different verb altogether; for example, ""My heart is jumping/fluttering/skipping beats because I'm so nervous.""",1,"Syntax, Semantics",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,8,6,3,3
I squeaked the door.,0,Syntax,"The verb ""squeak"" typically describes a sound made by something (or someone) other than the speaker. For example, we might say ""The door squeaks when it opens."" To indicate that the speaker caused the door to make a squeaking sound, we would use the construction ""I squeezed the door (to make it squeak)."" Therefore, without additional context or clarification, ""I sqeaked the door"" is syntactically incorrect because it implies that the subject (""I"") has the property of being able to produce the sound associated with a squeaky door.",1,"Syntax, Semantics",1,1,1,"0,5",1,"0,5",1,1,2,7,5,3,2
There presented itself a wonderful opportunity yesterday.,0,Syntax,"The verb ""present"" should be used as a transitive verb in this context, meaning it needs an object.

It was the policeman met that several young students in the park last night.,0,Syntax,"The verb tense is inconsistent in this sentence. ""was"" is past tense while ""met"" can be interpreted as either present or past tense. Additionally, there is a word order issue - it should be ""that several young students met the policeman.""

I drank some of water.,0,Syntax,"In English, we must use an article (a, an, or the) before a singular, countable noun unless it has been specified previously.

He washed yourself.,0,Syntax,"The verb ""wash"" requires an object pronoun (me, you, him, her, it, us, them) instead of a subject pronoun (I, he, she, we, they).

John is easy to please Kim.,0,Syntax,"The sentence ""John is easy to please Kim"" is syntactically incorrect because it lacks a preposition such as ""for"" or ""to"" before the name ""Kim."" A correct version could be ""John is easy to please (for) Kim"" or ""John is easy to be pleased by Kim,"" depending on the intended meaning. In the first corrected sentence, ""easy to please"" functions as a passive participial adjective phrase modifying ""John""; in the second, ""easy to be pleased"" acts as an adjectival relative clause modifying ""John"" while ""by Kim"" serves as a prepositional phrase indicating who pleases John easily.",1,,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,8,6,3,3
It tries to leave the country.,0,Syntax,"The subject (""it"") does not clearly refer to a specific antecedent, making the sentence syntactically incorrect without additional context.

There is believed to be sheep in the park.,0,Syntax,"The verb ""is"" or ""are"" needs to be added before ""believed.""

John will rain tomorrow.,0,Syntax,"In English, the subject (in this case, ""John"") cannot be the agent for a weather verb such as ""rain.""
