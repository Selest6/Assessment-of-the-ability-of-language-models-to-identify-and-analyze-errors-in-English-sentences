"The more you would want, the less you would eat.",0,"The fewer things you desire, the less you will eat. Explanation: The original sentence contains a grammatical error known as mixed construction. It starts off using comparative language (""the more... the less"") but then switches to superlative language (""you would want""). This inconsistency makes it difficult for readers to understand the intended meaning of the sentence. By changing it to use consistent comparative language throughout, we can make the sentence clearer and grammatically correct.",1,1,2,1
"I demand that the more John eat, the more he pays.",0,"The sentence should be ""The more John eats, the more he has to pay.""",1,1,2,1
What the water did to the bottle was fill it.,0,"The water filled the bottle. Explanation: A more natural way of expressing what happened would be using the past tense form ""filled"" instead of ""fill"". Additionally, there's no need for a relative clause (""what the water did"") as the subject (""the water"") can directly take the action verb (""filled"").",1,1,2,1
Sue gave to Bill a book.,0,"The sentence should be ""Sue gave Bill a book,"" without the word ""to"". In English, we don't typically include prepositions when describing direct objects of verbs like ""give"", so the indirect object (""Bill"") comes before the direct object (""a book"").",1,1,2,1
"We wanted to invite someone, but we couldn't decide who to.",0,"We wanted to invite someone, but we couldn't decide whom to invite.",1,1,2,1
Mary came to be introduced by the bartender and I also came to be.,0,"The sentence should be ""I also came."" instead of ""I also came to be."" The verb ""come"" does not need a helping verb here.",1,1,2,1
"I know which book Mag read, and which book Bob read my report that you hadn't.",0,"I know which book Mag read and which book Bob read, but I haven't seen your report yet. Explanation: The original sentence contains multiple errors. There should be a conjunction (""and"") connecting the two independent clauses instead of just a comma. Also, it would make more sense to include ""but"" before mentioning the report. Finally, there is no need for possessive pronouns such as ""'my'"" after ""report,"" since the subject (""I"") has already been established earlier in the sentence.",1,1,2,1
The mayor regarded as being absurd the proposal to build a sidewalk from Dartmouth to Smith.,0,"The mayor regarded as absurd the proposal to build a sidewalk from Dartmouth to Smith. Explanation: In this case, there is no need for ""as"" before ""being"". It can be simply written as ""The mayor regarded absurd the proposal..."" but it would still sound informal. So, I recommend using ""as"" after ""regarded"", making it clear that what follows next describes how the mayor regarded the proposal.",1,0,1,1
I want that Bill left to remain a secret.,0,"The sentence should be ""Bill left so as to keep it a secret,"" or ""Bill left in order for it to remain a secret."" The original sentence is grammatically incorrect because ""to"" cannot follow another infinitive without a conjunction such as ""in order"" or ""so as"".",1,1,2,1
Himself is understood by Rutherford.,0,"Rutherford understands himself. Explanation: In the original sentence, 'Himself' is used incorrectly as a subject complement. The reflexive pronoun 'himself' refers back to the subject of the sentence, which here is 'Rutherford'. However, it cannot be used as the direct object of the verb 'understood', so we need to rephrase the sentence accordingly.",1,1,2,1
I live at the place where Route 150 crosses the Hudson River and my dad lives at it too.,0,"The sentence should be ""The sentence is almost correct; however, 'it' should be replaced with 'there' to correctly refer back to the place mentioned earlier in the sentence. So the corrected version is: 'I live at the place where Route 150 crosses the Hudson River and my dad lives there too.'""",1,1,2,1
Wind was gotten of a plot to negotiate an honorable end to the war in Vietnam.,0,"The sentence has several errors. A corrected version would be: ""Wind had got **get**ten off a plot to negotiate an honorable end to the war in Vietnam."" However, even this revised sentence may still sound stilted or archaic to modern ears; it might be more natural to say something like ""Someone had uncovered a plot to negotiate an honorable end to the war in Vietnam"" instead.",1,"0,5","1,5",1
Here's a knife with which for you to cut up the onions.,0,"Here's a knife for you to cut up the onions with. Explanation: The preposition ""with"" should come after the verb it modifies (""cut"") rather than before it.",1,1,2,1
"The younger woman might have been tall and, and the older one definitely was, blond.",0,"The younger woman might have been tall and the older one definitely was blond. Explanation: There is a superfluous comma after ""tall"" that needs to be removed.",1,1,2,1
My mother is easy to please my father and.,0,"The sentence should be ""My mother is easy to please, even my father."" The original sentence is missing a comma after ""please"" and needs additional words to complete its meaning.",1,0,1,1
"No writer, and no playwright, meets in Vienna.",0,"At least one pair of writers or playwrights must meet in Vienna for the sentence to be grammatically correct. For example: ""At least one writer or playwright meets in Vienna.""",1,1,2,1
Sam offered the ball out of the basket.,0,"Sam offered the ball from the basket. Explanation: The preposition used here needs to be 'from' rather than 'out of'. We use 'offer something from somewhere', not 'offer something out of somewhere.'",1,1,2,1
Janet broke Bill on the finger.,0,"The sentence should be ""Janet broke Bill's finger"" as it indicates possession using ""'s"". Also, people can't be broken; body parts can.",1,1,2,1
Sharon came the room.,0,"The sentence should be ""Sharon came into the room.""",1,1,2,1
Brian threw the fence with the stick.,0,"The sentence should be ""Brian threw the stick over the fence,"" as it is not possible to throw a fence with a stick.",1,1,2,1
Paperback books lift onto the table easily.,0,"Books that are paperbacks can be easily lifted onto the table. Explanation: The original sentence contains a grammatical error. Instead of saying ""lift onto,"" it should say ""are lifted onto"" or simply ""can be placed on."" Additionally, the subject of the sentence should come before the verb for proper parallel structure, so instead of ""paperback books lift,"" it should say ""books that are paperbacks can be easily lifted.""",1,1,2,1
The jeweller scribbled the contract with his name.,0,"The sentence is not correct. The proper form of the sentence would be: ""The jeweler scrawled his name on the contract.""",1,1,2,1
Linda winked her lip.,0,"The sentence should be ""Linda **winked her eye**"" or **""flicked her lip""**. The original sentence is incorrect because people usually don't wink their lips - they might wink their eyes or flick their lips using a different verb.",1,1,2,1
My heart is pounding me.,0,"The sentence should be ""My heart is pounding"" instead of ""My heart is pounding me"".",1,1,2,1
The fort fluttered with many flags.,0,"The flag on the fort was fluttering with many others. Explanation: A single fort cannot flutter; only a flag can flutter. Therefore, I have corrected the original sentence to reflect that multiple flags were fluttering.",1,1,2,1
many information was provided.,0,"Much information was provided. Explanation: The word 'many' is used for countable nouns while 'much' is used for uncountable nouns. In this case, 'information' is an uncountable noun so we use 'much'.",1,1,2,1
Wash you!,0,"The sentence should be ""Wash **you**r hands"" or ""You wash your hands"". The original sentence has incorrect subject-verb agreement and word order.",1,1,2,1
They have no in.,0,"The sentence ""They have no in"" is not correct. A corrected version would be ""They have nothing.""",1,1,2,1
It was the policeman met that several young students in the park last night.,0,"The sentence should be ""It was the policeman who met several young students in the park last night.""",1,1,2,1
John sounded very.,0,"The sentence ""John sounded very"" is not correct. A suitable correction could be: ""John sounded very good.""",1,1,2,1
A good friend is remained to me by him.,0,"The sentence should be ""A good friend has remained loyal to me, thanks to him.""",1,1,2,1
John put under the bathtub.,0,"The sentence ""John put under the bathtub"" is incorrect. The correct version would be ""John put something under the bathtub.""",1,1,2,1
John is easy to please Kim.,0,"The correct sentence is ""John is easy to please."" or ""John is easy to please Kim's tastes,"" if it is intended that Kim's tastes are what is being pleased. In its current form, the sentence implies that John himself is easy for someone named Kim to please.",1,"0,5","1,5",1
We believed John to be a fountain in the park.,0,"The sentence is not correct. A revised version could be: ""We believed John to be near the fountain in the park.""",1,1,2,1
1 gave Mary after the party a book.,0,"I gave Mary a book after the party. Explanation: The correct order of words in this sentence would be ""subject + verb + indirect object + direct object + adverbial clause"". In your original sentence, the word ""after"" has been misplaced as it separated the direct object (""a book"") from its corresponding adverbial clause (""after the party"").",1,1,2,1
"Because she's so pleasant, as for Mary I really like her.",0,"The sentence should be ""Because she's so pleasant, as for me, I really like her."" instead of ""Because she's so pleasant, as for Mary I really like her."" because ""as for"" is followed by the speaker (""me"") rather than the subject being discussed (""Mary"").",1,1,2,1
Any trouble is what I don't want.,0,"The kind of trouble that I don't want is any trouble. Explanation: In your original sentence, ""Any"" modifies ""trouble,"" so it needs to be placed before ""trouble"" for clarity and proper grammar usage. Also, adding ""that"" makes the sentence clearer.",1,1,2,1
I hit that you knew the answer.,0,"I think you knew the answer. Explanation: The word ""hit"" is incorrect in this context. It seems that it was meant to be ""think,"" which would make sense grammatically.",1,1,2,1
the book of poems and from Blackwell takes a very long time to read.,0,"The sentence should be corrected as follows: ""Reading the book of poems and reading something from Blackwell take a very long time."" Alternatively, if only one thing is being read, it would be better to combine the two phrases into one action: ""Reading the book of poems from Blackwell takes a very long time.""",1,1,2,1
Was sunk.,0,"The sentence ""Was sunk."" is not grammatically complete. A proper sentence requires a subject and a verb at the very least. For example, ""The ship was sunk."" would be a grammatically correct sentence.",1,1,2,1
Kim alienated cats and beating his dog.,0,"Kim alienated cats and beat his dog. Explanation: The verb ""beat"" must be used instead of ""beating"" because it matches the subject-verb agreement required for the simple past tense. Additionally, there needs to be a period at the end of the sentence rather than using two separate thoughts with only a space between them.",1,1,2,1
Which article did Terry file papers without reading?,0,"Which article did Terry file without reading? Explanation: The word 'papers' is unnecessary in this context because it is implied by the verb 'file'. Additionally, there is no need for a determiner before 'article', making the corrected sentence read as follows: ""Which article did Terry file without reading?""",1,1,2,1
Kim and Terry is happy.,0,"The sentence should be ""Kim and Terry are happy.""",1,1,2,1
Sophie will theater.,0,"The sentence should be ""Sophie will go to the theater.""",1,1,2,1
Herself likes Mary's mother.,0,"Mary's mother likes herself. In the original sentence, it states that ""Herself likes Mary's mother,"" but using ""herself"" as the subject of the sentence implies that the person doing the action is also the object of the sentence. In order to convey the intended meaning correctly, we need to switch the positions of ""Mary's mother"" and ""herself"".",1,1,2,1
"Only Churchill remembered Churchill giving the Blood, Sweat and Tears speech.",0,"The only person who remembered Churchill giving the ""Blood, Sweat and Tears"" speech was Churchill himself. Explanation: In your original sentence, there were a couple of issues that needed to be corrected for proper grammar and clarity. I added the word ""only"" at the beginning to clarify that Churchill was the only one remembering his own speech. Additionally, I changed ""you are an English teacher"" to ""I am an English teacher,"" as it makes more sense in first-person point of view. Lastly, I rephrased some parts to improve overall readability while maintaining accuracy.",1,1,2,1
Gilgamesh is having fought the dragon.,0,"The sentence should be ""Gilgamesh has fought the dragon"" or ""Gilgamesh was fighting the dragon"". In present perfect tense, we use 'has' instead of 'is'.",1,1,2,1
What did you ask who saw?,0,"Who did you ask what they saw? OR What did you ask them when they saw? Explanation: The original question has a word order issue that makes it unclear. To clarify, we need to specify either who was seen or what action those people took before being asked about it.",1,"0,5","1,5",1
He can will go,0,"The sentence ""He can will go"" is not correct. The corrected sentence is ""He will be able to go.""",1,1,2,1
The monkey is ate the banana,0,The monkey ate the banana.,1,1,2,1
