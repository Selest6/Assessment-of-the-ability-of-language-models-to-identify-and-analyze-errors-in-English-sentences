"That the cops spoke to the janitor about it yesterday is terrible, that robbery.",0,Syntax,"The second part of the sentence, ""that robbery,"" is a fragment because it does not contain a verb.

He washed yourself.,0,Syntax,"The verb ""washed"" requires an object pronoun (""you""), not a reflexive pronoun (""yourself"").

It can be interpreted as John whispering while Mary left, but if we want to convey that John whispered something about Mary leaving, then a conjunction such as ""that"" needs to be added between ""whispered"" and ""Mary"".
